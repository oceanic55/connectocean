                <div class="caption">MacBook Pro models that Apple tested with M3 Ultra chip</div>
            </div>
            
<p id="m3-ultra-reveal">A new leak from iOS 18 development builds has revealed that Apple internally tested MacBook Pro models equipped with an unreleased M3 Ultra chip, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>
            
<p>The discovery was made by analyzing device identifiers and system logs within iOS 18 beta builds, which contained references to previously unknown MacBook Pro configurations featuring the <strong>M3 Ultra</strong> designation.</p>
            
<blockquote>
    "The M3 Ultra references appeared in multiple iOS 18 builds throughout the development cycle, suggesting Apple was actively testing these configurations alongside other M3-powered devices."
</blockquote>
            
<p>While Apple ultimately released the M3 chip family with standard M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max variants, the leaked data indicates the company explored a more powerful M3 Ultra option that never made it to market.</p>
            
<p>The M3 Ultra would have likely featured a dual M3 Max design, similar to how the <strong>M1 Ultra</strong> and <strong>M2 Ultra</strong> chips were constructed by connecting two Max variants using Apple's UltraFusion architecture.</p>
            
<p id="specifications">Based on the leaked information, the M3 Ultra-equipped MacBook Pros were being tested with configurations including:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Up to 24-core CPU (12 performance + 12 efficiency cores)</li>
                <li>Up to 76-core GPU</li>
                <li>Support for up to 192GB of unified memory</li>
                <li>Enhanced media engines for professional video workflows</li>
            </ul>
            
<p id="development-insight">Industry analysts suggest that Apple may have decided against releasing the M3 Ultra due to timing considerations, as the company was already preparing to transition to the M4 chip family for its high-end products.</p>
            
<p>The leak also reveals that Apple tested these M3 Ultra MacBook Pros with various display configurations, including both 14-inch and 16-inch models, though specific details about potential design changes remain unclear.</p>
            
<p><strong>Apple has not officially commented</strong> on the existence of M3 Ultra development, and it's unclear whether similar testing occurred for other product categories like the Mac Studio or Mac Pro.</p>
            
<p>This revelation provides insight into Apple's chip development process and suggests the company regularly explores more powerful configurations than what ultimately reaches consumers, keeping options open for future product releases.</p>
