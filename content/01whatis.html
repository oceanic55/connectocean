    <h1>1<br>What Is a Screenplay?</h1>

    <p>
In the summer of 1937, F. Scott Fitzgerald, drinking far too much, deeply in debt, and drowning in the suffocating well of despair, moved to Hollywood seeking new beginnings, hoping to reinvent himself by writing for the movies. The author of The Great Gatsby, Tender Is the Night, This Side of Paradise, and the uncompleted The Last Tycoon, perhaps America’s greatest novelist, was, as one friend put it, seeking redemption.

		During the two and a half years he spent in Hollywood, he took the craft of screenwriting “very seriously,” says one noted Fitzgerald authority: “It’s heartbreaking to see how much effort he put into it.” Fitzgerald approached every screenplay as if it were a novel and often wrote long backstories for each of the main characters before putting one word of dialogue down on paper.

		Despite all the preparation he put into each assignment, he was obsessed with finding the answer to a question that haunted him continuously: What makes a good screenplay? Billy Wilder once compared Fitzgerald to “a great sculptor who is hired to do a plumbing job. He did not know how to connect the pipes so the water could flow.”

		Throughout his Hollywood years, he was always trying to find the “balance” between the words spoken and the pictures seen. During this time, he received only one screen credit, adapting the novel Three Comrades by Erich Maria Remarque (starring Robert Taylor and Margaret Sullavan), but Joseph L. Mankiewicz eventually rewrote his script. He worked on rewrites for several other movies, including a disastrous week on Gone With the Wind (he was forbidden to use any words that did not appear in Margaret Mitchell’s novel), but after Three Comrades, all of his projects ended in failure. One, a script for Joan Crawford called Infidelity, was left uncompleted, canceled because it dealt with the theme of adultery. Fitzgerald died in 1941, working on his last, unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon.

		He died believing himself to be a failure.

		I’ve always been intrigued by the journey of F. Scott Fitzgerald. What resonates with me the most is that he was constantly searching for the answer to what made a good screenplay. His overwhelming external circumstances—his wife Zelda’s insti­tutio­naliz­ation, his unmanageable debts and lifestyle, his excessive drinking—all fed into his insecurities about the craft of screenwriting. And make no mistake: Screenwriting is a craft, a craft that can be learned. Even though he worked excessively hard, and was disciplined and responsible, he failed to achieve the results he was so desperately striving for.

		Why?

		I don’t think there’s any one answer. But reading his books and writings and letters from this period, it seems clear that he was never exactly sure what a screenplay was; he always wondered whether he was “doing it right,” whether there were certain rules he had to follow in order to write a successful screenplay.

		When I was studying at the University of California, Berkeley, as an English lit major, I read the first and second editions of Tender Is the Night for one of my classes. It is the story of a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients, who, as she slowly recovers, exhausts his vitality until he is “a man used up.” The book, the last one Fitzgerald completed, was considered technically faulty and was commercially unsuccessful.

		In the first edition of the novel, Book I is written from the point of view of Rosemary Hoyt, a young actress who shares her observations about meeting the circle that surrounds Dick and Nicole Diver. Rosemary is on the beach at Cap d’Antibes on the French Riviera, watching the Divers enjoying an outing on the sand. As she watches, she sees them as a beautiful couple who appear, at least from her point of view, to have everything going for them. They are, she thinks, the ideal couple. Rich, beautiful, intelligent, they look to be the embodiment of what everyone wants for himself or herself. But the second book of the novel focuses on the life of Dick and Nicole, and we learn that what we saw through Rosemary’s eyes was only the relationship they showed to the world; it was not really true. The Divers have major problems, which drain them emotionally and spiritually, and ultimately destroy them.

		When the first edition of Tender Is the Night was published, sales were poor, and Fitzgerald thought he had probably been drinking too much and might have compromised his vision. But from his Hollywood experience, he came to believe he did not introduce his main characters early enough. “Its great fault,” Fitzgerald wrote of Tender Is the Night to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, “is that the true beginning—the young psychiatrist in Switzerland—is tucked away in the middle of the book.” He decided that when the second edition was printed, he would interchange the first section with the second and open the novel with Dick Diver in wartime Switzerland in order to explain the mystery about the Divers’ courtship and marriage. So he opened the book focusing on the main character, Dick Diver. But that didn’t work either, and Fitzgerald was crushed. The book was financially unsuccessful until many years later, when Fitzgerald’s genius was finally acknowledged.

		What strikes me so vividly is what Fitzgerald didn’t see; his opening section focusing on how Rosemary saw the Divers was more cinematic than novelistic. It’s a great cinematic opening, setting up the characters as others see them, like an establishing shot; in this first edition, Fitzgerald was showing us how this model couple looked to the world, beautiful and rich, seeming to have everything. How we look to the outside world, of course, is a lot different from who we really are behind closed doors. My personal feeling is that it was Fitzgerald’s insecurity about the craft of screenwriting that drove him to change that great opening.

		F. Scott Fitzgerald was an artist literally caught between two worlds, caught between his genius as a writer and his self-doubt and inability to express that genius in screenplay form.

		Screenwriting is a definite craft, a definite art. Over the years, I’ve read thousands upon thousands of screenplays, and I always look for certain things. First, how does it look on the page? Is there plenty of white space, or are the paragraphs dense, too thick, the dialogue too long? Or is the reverse true: Is the scene description too thin, the dialogue too sparse? And this is before I read one word; this is just what it “looks” like on the page. You’d be surprised how many decisions are made in Hollywood by the way a screenplay looks—you can tell whether it’s been written by a professional or by someone who’s still aspiring to be a professional.

		Everybody is writing screenplays, from the waiter at your favorite bar or restaurant to the limo driver, the doctor, the lawyer, or the barista serving up the White Chocolate Dream Latte at the local Coffee Bean. Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East, and out of that number maybe four or five hundred scripts were actually produced.

		What makes one screenplay better than another? There are many answers, of course, because each screenplay is unique. But if you want to sit down and spend six months to a year writing a screenplay, you first have to know what a screenplay is—what its nature is.

		What is a screenplay? Is it a guide, or an outline, for a movie? A blueprint, or a diagram? Or maybe it’s a series of images, scenes, and sequences strung together with dialogue and description, like pearls on a strand? Perhaps it’s simply the landscape of a dream?

		Well, for one thing, a screenplay is not a novel, and it’s most certainly not a play. If you look at a novel and try to define its fundamental nature, you’ll see that the dramatic action, the story line, usually takes place inside the head of the main character. We see the story line unfold through the eyes of the character, through his/her point of view. We are privy to the character’s thoughts, feelings, emotions, words, actions, memories, dreams, hopes, ambitions, opinions, and more. The character and reader go through the action together, sharing in the drama and emotion of the story. We know how they act, feel, react, and figure things out. If other characters appear and are brought into the narrative line of action, then the story embraces their point of view, but the main thrust of the story line always returns to the main character. The main character is who the story is about. In a novel the action takes place inside the character’s head, within the mindscape of dramatic action.

		A play is different. The action, or story line, occurs onstage, under the proscenium arch, and the audience becomes the fourth wall, eavesdropping on the lives of the characters, what they think and feel and say. They talk about their hopes and dreams, past and future plans, discuss their needs and desires, fears and conflicts. In this case, the action of the play occurs within the language of dramatic action; it is spoken in words that describe feelings, actions, and emotions.

		A screenplay is different. Movies are different. Film is a visual medium that dramatizes a basic story line; it deals in pictures, images, bits and pieces of film: We see a clock ticking, a window opening, a person in the distance leaning over a balcony, smoking; in the background we hear a phone ringing, a baby crying, a dog barking as we see two people laughing as their car pulls away from the curb. “Just making pictures.” The nature of the screenplay deals in pictures, and if we wanted to define it, we could say that a screenplay is a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.

		That is its essential nature, just like a rock is hard and water’s wet.

		Because a screenplay is a story told with pictures, we can ask ourselves, what do all stories have in common? They have a beginning, middle, and an end, not necessarily in that order, as Jean-Luc Godard says. Screenplays have a basic linear structure that creates the form of the screenplay because it holds all the individual elements, or pieces, of the story line in place.

		To understand the principle of structure, it’s important to start with the word itself. The root of structure, struct, has two definitions that are relevant. The first definition means “to build” or “to put something together,” like a building or car. The second definition is “the relationship between the parts and the whole.”

		The parts and the whole. This is an important distinction. What is the relationship between the parts and the whole? How do you separate one from the other? If you take the game of chess, for example, the game itself is a whole composed of four parts: (1) the pieces—the queen, king, bishop, pawns, knights, etc.; (2) the player(s), because someone has to play the game of chess, either against another person or a computer; (3) the board, because you can’t play chess without a board, and (4) the rules, because you can’t play a chess game unless you play by the rules. Those four parts—the pieces, the player(s), the board, and the rules—are integrated into the whole, and the result is a game of chess. It is the relationship between these parts and the whole that determines the game.

		The same relationship holds true in a story. A story is the whole, and the elements that make up the story—the action, characters, conflicts, scenes, sequences, dialogue, action, Acts I, II, and III, incidents, episodes, events, music, locations, etc.—are the parts, and this relationship between the parts and the whole make up the story.

		Good structure is like the relationship between an ice cube and water. An ice cube has a definite crystalline structure, and water has a definite molecular structure. But when the ice cube melts into water, how can you separate the molecules of ice from the molecules of water? Structure is like gravity: It is the glue that holds the story in place; it is the base, the foundation, the spine, the skeleton of the story. And it is this relationship between the parts and the whole that holds the screenplay together. It’s what makes it what it is.

		It is the paradigm of dramatic structure.

		A paradigm is a model, example, or conceptual scheme. The paradigm of a table, for example, is a top with four legs. Within the paradigm, we can have a low table, high table, narrow table, or wide table; we can have a round table, square table, rectangular table, or octagonal table; we can have a glass table, wood table, plastic table, wrought-iron table, or whatever, and the paradigm doesn’t change—it remains what it is, a top with four legs. Just the way a suitcase remains a suitcase; it doesn’t matter how big or small, or what the shape is; it is what it is.

		If we wanted to take a screenplay and hang it on the wall like a painting, this is what it would look like:





		This is the paradigm of a screenplay. Here’s how it’s broken down:

		ACT I IS THE SET-UP

		If a screenplay is a story told with pictures, then what do all stories have in common? A beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily, as mentioned, in that order; it is a story told in pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.

		Aristotle talked about the three unities of dramatic action: time, place, and action. The normal Hollywood film is approximately two hours long, or 120 minutes; foreign films tend to be a little shorter, though that’s changing as we bridge the language of international film. But in most cases, films are approximately two hours in length, give or take a few minutes. This is a standard length, and today, when a contract is written in Hollywood between the filmmaker and production company, it states that when the movie is delivered, it will be no longer than 2 hours and 8 minutes. That’s approximately 128 pages of screenplay. Why? Because it’s an economic decision that has evolved over the years. At this writing, it costs approximately $10,000 to $12,000 per minute (and getting higher and higher every year) to shoot a Hollywood studio film. Second, a two-hour movie has a definite advantage in the theaters simply because you can get in more viewings of the movie per day. More screenings mean more money; more theaters mean more screenings, which means more money will be made. Movies are show business, after all, and with the cost of moviemaking being so high, and getting higher as our technology evolves, today it’s really more business than show.

		The way it breaks down is this: One page of screenplay is approximately one minute of screen time. It doesn’t matter whether the script is all action, all dialogue, or any combination of the two—generally speaking, a page of screenplay equals a minute of screen time. It’s a good rule of thumb to follow. There are exceptions to this, of course. The script of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is only 118 pages, but the movie is more than three hours long.

		Act I, the beginning, is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately twenty or thirty pages long and is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. Context is the space that holds something in place—in this case, the content. For example, the space inside a glass is the context; it holds the content in place—whether it’s water, beer, milk, coffee, tea, or juice. If we want to get creative, a glass can also hold raisins, trail mix, nuts, grapes, etc.—but the space inside doesn’t change The context is what holds the content in place.

		In this unit of dramatic action, Act I, the screenwriter sets up the story, establishes character, launches the dramatic premise (what the story is about), illustrates the situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and creates the relationships between the main character and the other characters who inhabit the landscape of his or her world. As a writer you’ve only got about ten minutes to establish this, because the audience members can usually determine, either consciously or unconsciously, whether they do or don’t like the movie by that time. If they don’t know what’s going on and the opening is vague or boring, their concentration and focus will falter and start wandering.

		Check it out. The next time you go to a movie, do a little exercise: Find out how long it takes you to make a decision about whether you like the film or not. A good indication is if you start thinking about getting something from the refreshment stand or find yourself shifting in your seat; if that happens, the chances are the filmmaker has lost you as a viewer. Ten minutes is ten pages of screenplay. I cannot emphasize enough that this first ten-page unit of dramatic action is the most important part of the screenplay.

		In American Beauty (Alan Ball), after the brief opening video scene of the daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and her boyfriend, Ricky (Wes Bentley), we see the street where Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) lives, and hear his first words in voice-over: “My name is Lester Burnham. I’m forty-two years old. In less than a year, I’ll be dead….In a way, I’m dead already.” Then we see Lester as he begins his day. He wakes up and jerks off (the high point of his day, he adds), and then we see his relationship with his family. All this is set up and established within the first few pages, and we learn that: “My wife and daughter think I’m this gigantic loser, and they’re right….I have lost something. I don’t know what it was, but I have lost something….I feel sedated….But you know, it’s never too late to get it back.” And that lets us know what the story is all about: Lester regaining the life he has lost or given up, and becoming whole and complete again as a person. Within the first few pages of the screenplay we know the main character, the dramatic premise, and the situation.

		In Chinatown (Robert Towne), we learn on page one that Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), the main character, is a sleazy private detective specializing in “discreet investigation.” We see this when he shows Curly (Burt Young) pictures of his wife having sex in the park. We also see that Gittes has a certain flair for this type of investigation. A few pages later, we are introduced to a certain Mrs. Mulwray (Diane Ladd), who wants to hire Jake Gittes to find out “who my husband is having an affair with.” That is the dramatic premise of the film, because the answer to that question is what leads us into the story. The dramatic premise is what the screenplay is about; it provides the dramatic thrust that drives the story to its conclusion.

		In Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Peter Jackson, based on the book by J. R. R. Tolkien), we learn in the first six pages of the screenplay the history of the ring and its magnetic attraction. It’s a beautiful opening that sets up all three stories. It also sets up the story as Gandalf arrives in the Shire. We meet Frodo (Elijah Wood), Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), Sam (Sean Astin), and the others, see how they live, and are introduced to the ring. We also get an overview of Middle Earth. This opening sets up the rest of the Fellowship, including the two sequels, The Two Towers and Return of the King.

		In Witness (Earl Wallace and William Kelley), the first ten pages reveal the world of the Amish in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The script opens with the funeral of Rachel’s (Kelly McGillis’s) husband, then we follow her to Philadelphia, where her child witnesses the murder of an undercover cop, and that in turn leads to her relationship with the main character, John Book (Harrison Ford), another cop. The entire first act is designed to reveal the dramatic premise and situation and to set up the relationship between an Amish woman and a tough Philadelphia cop.

		ACT II IS CONFRONTATION

		 			Act II is a unit of dramatic action approximately sixty pages long, and goes from the end of Act I, anywhere from pages 20 to 30, to the end of Act II, approximately pages 85 to 90,, and is held together with the dramatic context known as Confrontation. During this second act the main character encounters obstacle after obstacle that keeps him/her from achieving his/her dramatic need, which is defined as what the character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay. If you know your character’s dramatic need, you can create obstacles to it and then your story becomes your character, overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his/her dramatic need.

		In Cold Mountain, Inman (Jude Law) struggles over two hundred miles to return home to Cold Mountain. This dramatic need is both internal and external: It is Inman’s longing to return to a place in his heart that existed prior to the war, and Cold Mountain is also the place where he lived and grew up, as well as where his loved one, Ada (Nicole Kidman), resides. His desire, his dramatic need to return home, is fraught with obstacle after obstacle, and still he persists, only to fail at the end. Literally, the entire movie is overcoming the obstacles of war and the internal will to survive.

		In Chinatown, a detective story, Act II deals with Jake Gittes’s collisions with people who try to keep him from finding out who’s responsible for the murder of Hollis Mulwray and who’s behind the water scandal. The obstacles that Gittes encounters and overcomes dictate the dramatic action of the story. Look at The Fugitive. The entire story is driven by the main character’s dramatic need to bring his wife’s killer to justice. Act II is where your character has to deal with surviving the obstacles that you put in front of him or her. What is it that drives him or her forward through the action? What does your main character want? What is his or her dramatic need? In Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the entire film involves Frodo, Sam, and the Fellowship’s confronting and managing to overcome obstacle after obstacle, leading to the climactic battle at Helms Deep.

		All drama is conflict. Without conflict, you have no action; without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story; and without story, you have no screenplay.

		ACT III IS RESOLUTION

		 			Act III is a unit of dramatic action approximately twenty to thirty pages long and goes from the end of Act II, approximately pages 85 to 90,, to the end of the screenplay. It is held together with the dramatic context known as Resolution. I think it’s important to remember that resolution does not mean ending; resolution means solution. What is the solution of your screenplay? Does your main character live or die? Succeed or fail? Get married or not? Win the race or not? Win the election or not? Escape safely or not? Leave her husband or not? Return home safely or not? Act III is that unit of action that resolves the story. It is not the ending; the ending is that specific scene or shot or sequence that ends the script.

		Beginning, middle, and end; Act I, Act II, Act III. Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution—these parts make up the whole. It is the relationship between these parts that determines the whole.

		But this brings up another question: If these parts make up the whole, the screenplay, how do you get from Act I, the Set-Up, to Act II, the Confrontation? And how do you get from Act II to Act III, the Resolution? The answer is to create a Plot Point at the end of both Act I and Act II.

		A Plot Point is defined as any incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction—in this case, Plot Point I moves the action forward into Act II and Plot Point II moves the action into Act III. Plot Point I occurs at the end of Act I, anywhere from pages 20 to 25 or 30.

		A Plot Point is always a function of the main character. In Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Plot Point I is the beginning of the journey, that moment when Frodo and Sam leave the Shire and set out on their adventure through Middle Earth. Plot Point II is when the Fellowship reaches Lothlorien, and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) reveals to Frodo the fate of Middle Earth should the ring not reach Mount Doom. Frodo becomes the reluctant hero, in much the same way that Neo (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix (Larry and Andy Wachowski), accepts his mantle of responsibility at Plot Point I: his journey as “The One” begins at Plot Point I. It is the true beginning of that story.

		If we take a look at The Matrix, we can see Plot Points I and II clearly delineated. In Plot Point I, Neo chooses the Red Pill, and Act II begins when he is literally reborn; at Plot Point II, Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) rescue Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and only then does Neo accept the truth that he is “The One.”

		Plot Points serve an essential purpose in the screenplay; they are a major story progression and keep the story line anchored in place. In Chinatown, Jake Gittes is hired by the wife of a prominent man to find out if her husband is having an affair. Gittes follows him and sees him with a young girl. That’s the Set-Up. Plot Point I occurs after the newspaper story is released claiming Mr. Mulwray has been caught in a “love nest.” That’s when the real Mrs. Mulwray shows up with her attorney and threatens to sue Jake Gittes and have his license revoked. If she is the real Mrs. Mulwray, who was the woman who hired Jake Gittes? And why did she hire him? And who hired the phony Mrs. Mulwray? And why? The arrival of the real Mrs. Mulwray is what hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction—in this case, Act II. It is story progression; Jake Gittes must find out who set him up, and why. The answer is the rest of the movie.

		In Cold Mountain, as Inman recovers from his wounds he receives a letter from Ada. We hear her say, in voice-over, “Come back to me. Come back to me is my request.” Inman nods; his decision is made: He will desert the Confederate Army and return home to Ada and Cold Mountain, return to the place in his heart.

		Plot Points do not have to be big, dynamic scenes or sequences; they can be quiet scenes in which a decision is made, such as Inman’s, or when Frodo and Sam leave the Shire. Take the sequence in American Beauty where Lester Burnham and his wife are at the high school basketball game and see their daughter’s friend Angela (Mena Suvari) performing at halftime. It moves the story forward and sets Lester’s emotional journey of liberation in motion. In The Matrix, Plot Point I is where Neo is offered the choice of the Red Pill or the Blue Pill. He chooses the Red Pill, and this truly is the beginning of the story. All of Act I has set up the elements and led Neo to this moment.

		Remember, the paradigm is the form of a screenplay, what it looks like. Any page numbers I reference are only a guideline to indicate approximately where the story progresses to the next level, not how it progresses. How you do that is up to you. It is the form of the screenplay that is important, not the page numbers where Plot Points occur. There may be many Plot Points during the course of the story line; I only focus on Plot Points I and II because these two events are the anchoring moments that become the foundation of the dramatic structure in the screenplay.

		Plot Point II is really the same as Plot Point I; it is the way to move the story forward, from Act II to Act III. It is a story progression. As mentioned, it usually occurs anywhere between pages 80 or 90 of the screenplay. In Chinatown, Plot Point II occurs when Jake Gittes finds a pair of horn-rim glasses in the pond where Hollis Mulwray was murdered, and knows the glasses belonged either to Mulwray or to the person who killed him. This leads us to the Resolution of the story.

		In Cold Mountain, Plot Point II is a quiet moment; after Inman meets the woman Sara (Natalie Portman) and rescues her and her baby from the Northerners, he reaches a point where he can see the Blue Ridge Mountains. The script reads: “Somewhere in there is home, is Ada. He goes on.” That’s all; such a small scene, but loaded with such emotion: He’s home. That leads us into Act III, the Resolution.

		Do all good screenplays fit the paradigm? Yes. But just because a screenplay is well structured and fits the paradigm doesn’t make it a good screenplay, or a good movie. The paradigm is a form, not a formula. Structure is what holds the story together.

		What’s the distinction between form and formula? The form of a coat or jacket, for example, is two arms, a front, and a back. And within that form of arms, front, and back you can have any variation of style, fabric, color, and size—but the form remains intact.

		A formula, however, is totally different. A formula never varies; certain elements are put together so they come out exactly the same each and every time. If you put that coat on an assembly line, every coat will be exactly the same, with the same pattern, the same fabric, the same color, the same cut, the same material. The coat does not change, except for the size. A screenplay, on the other hand, is unique, a totally individual presentation.

		The paradigm is a form, not a formula; it’s what holds the story together. It is the spine, the skeleton. Story determines structure; structure doesn’t determine story.

		The dramatic structure of the screenplay may be defined as a linear arrangement of related incidents, episodes, or events leading to a dramatic resolution.

		How you utilize these structural components determines the form of your screenplay. The Hours (David Hare, adapted from the novel by Michael Cunningham) is told in three different time periods and has a definite structure. It’s the same with American Beauty: The whole story is told in flashback, just like Woody Allen’s Annie Hall. Cold Mountain is also told in flashback, but has a definite beginning, middle, and end. Citizen Kane is also told in flashback, but this does not detract from its form.

		The paradigm is a model, an example, or a conceptual scheme; it is what a well-structured screenplay looks like, an overview of the story line as it unfolds from beginning to end.

		Screenplays that work follow the paradigm. But don’t take my word for it. Go to a movie and see whether you can determine its structure for yourself.

		Some of you may not believe that. You may not believe in beginnings, middles, and ends, either. You may say that art, like life, is nothing more than several individual “moments” suspended in some giant middle, with no beginning and no end, what Kurt Vonnegut calls “a series of random moments” strung together in a haphazard fashion.

		I disagree.

		Birth? Life? Death? Isn’t that a beginning, middle, and end? Spring, summer, fall, and winter—isn’t that a beginning, middle, and end? Morning, afternoon, evening—it’s always the same, but different. Think about the rise and fall of great ancient civilizations—Egyptian, Greek, and Roman, each rising from the seed of a small community to the apex of power, then disintegrating and dying.

		Think about the birth and death of a star, or the beginning of the universe. If there’s a beginning, like the Big Bang, is there going to be an end?

		Think about the cells in our bodies. How often are they replenished, restored, and re-created? Every seven years—within a seven-year cycle all the cells in our bodies are born, function, die, and are reborn again.

		Think about the first day of a new job, or a new school, or a new house or apartment; you’ll meet new people, assume new responsibilities, create new friendships.

		Screenplays are no different. They have a definite beginning, middle, and end, but not necessarily in that order.

		If you don’t believe the paradigm, or in the three-act structure first laid down by Aristotle, go check it out. Go to a movie—go see several movies—and see whether they fit the paradigm or not.

		If you’re interested in writing screenplays, you should be doing this all the time. Every movie you see is a learning process, expanding your awareness and comprehension of what a movie is: a story told with pictures.

		You should also read as many screenplays as possible in order to expand your awareness of the form and structure. Many screenplays have been reprinted in book form and most bookstores have them, or can order them. You can also go online and do a Google search under “screenplays” and find a number of sites that allow you to download screenplays. Some are free, some you pay for.

		I have my students read and study scripts like Chinatown, Network (Paddy Chayefsky), American Beauty, The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont), Sideways (Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor), The Matrix, Annie Hall, and Lord of the Rings. These scripts are excellent teaching aids. If they aren’t available, read any screenplay you can find. The more the better.

		The paradigm works. It is the foundation of every good screenplay, the foundation of dramatic structure.

			—Everett Sloane speculating on the meaning of “Rosebud”

			Citizen Kane

			Herman Mankiewicz and Orson Welles





Orsen Welles’s Citizen Kane has been universally acclaimed as the greatest film ever made. From the very first frame, the full portrait of Kane’s character is set up visually; the film opens shrouded in fog and the first thing we see is a high wired chain-link fence bolstered with the initial K. Deep in the background, a huge, isolated mansion stands high on the hill. Moving closer, we see boxes and crates of antiques, artworks, and ancient artifacts stacked everywhere. Huge pens house exotic animals, and then we’re inside the enormous castle, so full, yet so empty of life. Then we cut to an extreme close-up of the man known as Citizen Kane as he whispers his last word: “Rosebud.” A glass paperweight falls from his fingers and breaks open, and we see snow, the first glimpse of a lost childhood.

		Like a classic mystery, the story begins. Who is Charles Foster Kane? What is he? Who or what is Rosebud? As if in answer, we cut to a darkened screening room filled with chain-smoking reporters and watch newsreel footage of Charles Foster Kane, a man larger than life, filled with an insatiable appetite, a man of total excess.

		The great director Robert Wise (West Side Story, The Sound of Music, The Sand Pebbles, to name just a few) edited the film, and he shared with me in one of our conversations that Welles first shot all the simulated newsreel footage, and then, to make it appear more “real,” he had Wise crinkle it up and drag it across the cutting room floor. It lent an authentic, credible look to the film. Kane’s entire life is visually set up in less than a minute—through pictures, not words.

		Citizen Kane is truly a story told with pictures, a search for the hidden meaning of Kane’s life, which revolves around the last words he utters on his deathbed. I call it “an emotional detective story,” because the search for who and what Rosebud is leads us to uncover the life of Charles Foster Kane. It’s the answer to this question that tells us what the movie is about. It is the subject of the screenplay.

		What do you need to write a screenplay? An idea, of course, but you can’t sit down to write a script with just an idea in mind. An idea, while essential, is nothing more than a vague notion. It has no detail, no depth, no dimension. No, you need more than just an idea to start writing a screenplay.

		You need a subject to embody and dramatize the idea. A subject is defined as an action and a character. An action is what the story is about, and a character is who the story is about.

		Every screenplay has a subject—it is what the story is about.

		If we remember that a screenplay is like a noun, about a person in a place, doing his/her “thing,” we can see that the person is the main character and doing his/her “thing” is the action. So, when we talk about the subject of a screenplay, we’re talking about an action and a character or characters.

		Every screenplay dramatizes an action and a character. You, as the screenwriter, must know who your movie is about and what happens to him or her. It is a primary principle in writing, not only in screenplays but in all forms of writing.

		Only at the end of Citizen Kane, after his death (which is where the story really begins), when the warehouse is being cleared of what seems to be endless piles of junk, curios, furniture, and unpacked crates, do we understand the significance of Rosebud. As the camera moves into a darkened corner, we see a huge collection of toys, paintings, and statues. Slowly, the camera pans Kane’s possessions, until it reaches the blazing furnace. Workmen are tossing various items into the flames. One of the items is a sled, the very one Kane had as a boy in Colorado. When it’s thrown into the fire the camera moves in tight on the sled, and as it catches fire, the name “Rosebud” is revealed.

		Only then do we recall that when Mr. Thatcher, the executor of Kane’s estate, first describes his meeting with Kane as a boy of ten or so, young Charles is sledding down the hill in the snow. It is an emotionally riveting moment, emblematic of the lost youth Kane would spend his life searching for, but never find. We cut outside the huge mansion as the smoke from Kane’s lost youth curls upward into the night sky. The film ends with the same shot of the iron fence that opened the film. “I was with him from the very beginning,” Mr. Bernstein says during the film, adding, “Mr. Kane was a man who lost everything he had.” It is one of the great moments in movie history.

		If you want to write a screenplay, what is it about? And who is it about? Citizen Kane begins with a search based on a dying man’s last words and ends up revealing the secret of his entire life. Seeking the answer provides the narrative thrust, the emotional through line of the film.

		Do you know the subject of your screenplay? What it’s about? And who is it about? Can you express it in a few sentences? Do you, for example, want to tell the story of two women going on a crime spree? If you do, do you know who these two women are? Where they came from? What their background is? And then, what crimes did they commit? And why? Do you know what happens to them at the end? Defining the answers to these questions allows you to gather enough information to write your screenplay from the position of choice, confidence, and security. If you know what you’re doing, then you can figure out the best way of doing it.

		Knowing your subject is the starting point of writing the screenplay. And make no mistake: Every screenplay has a subject. The Last Samurai (John Logan) is about an embittered Civil War mercenary (Tom Cruise) who travels to Japan and is ultimately transformed by the people who were originally his enemy, a band of samurai warriors. The character is the Civil War mercenary, and the action is how he is transformed in thought, word, and action, allowing him to regain a sense of self he had lost after the war ended. But that’s only what the film is about on the surface. On a deeper level, what it’s really about is how the American military adviser learns to embody the virtues of honor and loyalty.

		Cold Mountain is about Inman’s returning home to the town he lived in prior to the war and returning to his loved one, Ada. But on a deeper, more emotional level, the story is about a place in the heart, a place filled with love and meaning, a place that was sacred before hostilities began and before people started killing in the name of political “correctness,” a place that took this great gift of life for granted, before our sensibilities and moral standards began to crumble in the chasm of war.

		Bonnie and Clyde (David Newman and Robert Benton) is a story about Clyde Barrow and his gang holding up banks in the Midwest during the Depression and the robbers’ eventual downfall. Action and character. It’s essential to isolate your generalized idea into a specific dramatic premise. And that becomes the starting point of your screenplay.

		Again, every story has a definite beginning, middle, and end. In Bonnie and Clyde, the beginning dramatizes the meeting of Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde (Warren Beatty) and the forming of their gang. In the middle, they hold up several banks and the law goes after them. In the end, they are caught by the forces of society and killed. Set-Up, Confrontation, and Resolution.

		When you can articulate your subject in a few sentences, in terms of action and character, you’re ready to begin expanding the elements of structure and story. It may take several pages of free-association writing about your story before you can begin to grasp the essentials and reduce a complex story line to a simple sentence or two. Don’t worry about it. Just keep doing it, and you will be able to articulate your story idea clearly and concisely.

		Knowing what you are writing about is absolutely essential as you delve deeper into the action and characters. Because if you don’t know what your story is about, who does? The reader? The viewer? If you don’t know what you’re writing about, how do you expect someone else to know? The writer must always exercise choice and responsibility in determining the dramatic execution of the story. Choice and responsibility—these words will be a familiar refrain throughout this book. Every creative decision must be made by choice, not necessity. If your character walks out of a bank, that’s one story. If he runs out of a bank, that’s another story.

		Many times you may feel the urge to sit down and start writing a screenplay but you don’t really know what to write about. So you go looking for a subject. Just know that when you’re looking for your subject, your subject is really looking for you. You’ll find it someplace, at some time, probably when you’re least expecting it. It will be yours to follow through on or not, as you choose.

		What or whom do you want to write about? A character? A particular emotional situation? An experience that you or one of your family members or friends has gone through? Many people already have ideas they want to turn into a screenplay. Others don’t. How do you go about finding a subject?

		An idea in a newspaper or on the TV news or an incident that might have happened to a friend or relative can be the subject of a movie. The Pianist (Ron Harwood, from the memoir by Wladyslaw Szpilman) is a film about survival, based on the writings of a survivor of the Holocaust, but it also reflects the childhood of director Roman Polanski. Saving Private Ryan (Robert Rodat) is based on an actual incident that occurred during World War II. In The Royal Tenenbaums (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson), the subject is a dysfunctional family dealing with failure and forgiveness. Dog Day Afternoon (Frank Pierson) was a newspaper article before it became a movie.

		Before Robert Towne wrote Chinatown, he once told me, he wanted to write a Raymond Chandler–type detective story. He found the material for Chinatown in a Los Angeles water scandal he read about in an old newspaper of that period, and used the backdrop of the Owens Valley scandal for his detective story. Shampoo (Robert Towne and Warren Beatty) grew out of several incidents involving a celebrated Hollywood hairstylist. Collateral (Stuart Beattie) emerged during the writer’s conversation with a taxi driver. Taxi Driver (Paul Schrader) is a story about the loneliness of driving a cab in New York City. Bonnie and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (William Goldman), and All the President’s Men (William Goldman) grew out of real people in real situations. Your subject will find you, given the opportunity. It’s very simple. Trust yourself. Just start looking for an action and a character.

		When you can express your idea succinctly in terms of action and character—my story is about this person, in this place, doing his/her “thing”—you’re beginning the preparation of your screenplay.

		The next step is expanding your subject. Fleshing out the action and focusing on the character broadens the story line and accentuates the details. Gather your material any way you can. It will always be to your advantage.

		Over the years, I talked to a lot of people who wondered about the value, or necessity, of doing research. I began my career in film by making documentaries for David L. Wolper, working on such shows as the Biography series with Mike Wallace, winner of the Peabody Award; Hollywood and the Stars; the National Geographic shows; Men in Crisis; some of the Jacques Cousteau specials; and many more. It was while I was at Wolper that I learned the value of research. It became an indispensable part of my writing and teaching experience.

		On every show I’ve ever been associated with, as writer, director, producer, or researcher, I’ve begun the process by finding out as much as I can about the subject. As far as I’m concerned, research is absolutely essential. All writing entails research, and research means gathering information. Remember, the hardest part of writing is knowing what to write.

		By doing research—whether in written sources such as books, magazines, or newspapers or through personal interviews—you acquire information. The information you collect allows you to operate from the position of choice, confidence, and responsibility. You can choose to use some, or all, or none of the material you’ve gathered; that’s your choice, dictated by the terms of the story. Not using it because you don’t have it offers you no choice at all, and will always work against you and your story.

		Too many people start writing their material with only a vague, half-formed idea in their heads. This works for about thirty pages, then falls apart. You don’t know what happens next, or what to do next, or where to go, and you end up getting angry, confused, and frustrated. Then, in most cases, you give up.

		There are two kinds of research. One I call text research. That means going to the library and pulling out books and newspaper and magazine articles and reading about a period, people, a profession, or whatever. If you’re writing a period piece or a historical piece, you need to gather information about the time and the events that happened during it and then weave your emotional through line into your characters. I get most of my information from reading about the period and any first-person writings I can find. If you’re writing about a subject that you don’t know much about, you need to get information to make your story line real, believable, and true. Edward Zwick, who directed The Last Samurai, worked extensively with John Logan, the writer. Zwick spent more than a year reading about the Japanese culture and the samurai tradition.

		The second form of research I call live research. It means going to the source—doing live interviews, talking to people, getting a “feel” for the subject. If it is necessary or possible to conduct personal interviews, you’ll be surprised to find that most people are willing to help you in any way they can, and will often go out of their way to assist you in your search for accurate information. Personal interviews offer another advantage: They can give you a more immediate and spontaneous slant than a book, newspaper, or magazine story. It’s the next best thing to having experienced something yourself. Remember: The more you know, the more you can communicate. And be in a position of choice and responsibility when making creative decisions.

		At present, I’m writing a sci-fi epic space adventure, about a cosmic phenomenon that drastically impacts Earth. Since I know nothing about cosmic events of this magnitude, I made contact with the media relations person at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and she gave me a lot of information, along with the names of some scientists. I then spent almost three months learning about the phenomenon known as a “gamma ray burst.” With this information, even though I’m stretching the bounds of reality to “fit” my creative purpose, the subject is still based on reality, what could happen if this event actually came to pass.

		A while ago I had the opportunity of working on a story with Craig Breedlove, onetime holder of the World Land Speed Record, and the first man to go 400, 500, and 600 miles per hour on land and live. Craig created a jet-propelled car that traveled at a speed of 400 miles per hour for a quarter mile. The rocket system was the same system used to land a man on the moon. I spent several days hanging out with him and reading the history of the Land Speed Record.

		The story is about a man breaking the World Water Speed Record in a rocket boat. But a rocket boat doesn’t exist, at least at this writing. I had to do all kinds of research to find out about my subject matter. What is the Water Speed Record? Where do you go to break the record? Is it possible for a rocket boat to beat the record? How do the officials time the boats? Is a speed of over 400 miles per hour on water possible? From my conversations with Craig, I learned about rocket systems, the Water Speed Record, and designing and building a racing boat. And out of those conversations came an action and a character. And a way to fuse fact and fiction into a dramatic story line.

		The principle rule of storytelling bears repetition: The more you know, the more you can communicate.

		Research is essential in writing a screenplay. Once you choose your subject, and can state it briefly in a sentence or two, you can begin preliminary research. Determine where you can go to increase your knowledge of the subject. Paul Schrader, who wrote Taxi Driver, once wanted to write a movie that took place on a train. So he took a train from Los Angeles to New York, and when he stepped off the train he realized he didn’t have a story; he hadn’t found one. That’s okay. Choose another subject. Schrader went on to write Obsession, and Colin Higgins, who wrote Harold and Maude, went on to write a train story, Silver Streak. Richard Brooks spent eight months researching Bite the Bullet before he put one word on paper. He did the same thing with The Professionals and In Cold Blood, even though he based the latter on Truman Capote’s exhaustively researched book. Waldo Salt, who wrote Midnight Cowboy, researched Coming Home by speaking to and recording some twenty-six paralyzed Vietnam veterans, which resulted in two hundred hours of taped interviews.

		Waldo Salt believed in capturing “the truth” of the characters in a story. I had the good fortune of having several conversations with Waldo, and he was not only an extraordinary writer, but an extraordinary person. We talked about the craft of screenwriting a lot, and Waldo told me that he believed the character’s need (the dramatic need—what the character wants to win, gain, or achieve) determines the dramatic structure. His words resonated with me immediately, and I shared with him that I had recently come to the same understanding while I was analyzing Woody Allen’s Annie Hall: The character’s need determines the creative choices he/she makes during the screenplay, and gaining clarity about that need allows you to be more complex, more dimensional, in your character portrayal.

		It was a powerful moment for both of us as we sat in an unspoken glow of communication that was more powerful than words, and it led to a long and passionate discussion about capturing “the truth of the human condition” in a screenplay. The key to a successful screenplay, Waldo emphasized, was preparing the material. Dialogue, he said, is “perishable,” because the actor can always improvise lines to make something work. But, he added forcefully, the character’s dramatic need is sacrosanct. That cannot be changed, because it holds the entire story in place. Putting words down on paper, he said, is the easiest part of the screenwriting process; it is the visual conception of the story that takes so long. And he quoted Picasso: “Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.”

		If you’re writing a story about a bicycle racer like Lance Armstrong, for example, what kind of racer is he? A sprinter or a long-distance racer? Where do the bicycle races take place? Where do you want to set your story? In what city? Are there different types of races, or racing circuits? Associations and clubs? How many races are held throughout the year? What about international competition? Does it affect your story? The character? What kind of bikes are used? How do you become a bicycle racer? These questions must be answered before you start putting words on paper.

		Research gives you ideas, a sense of people, situation, and locale. It allows you to gain a degree of confidence so you are always on top of your subject, operating from choice, not necessity or ignorance.

		Start with your subject. When you think subject, think action and character. This is what subject looks like in a diagram.





		There are two kinds of action—physical action and emotional action. Physical action can be a battle sequence, like the opening of Cold Mountain; or a car chase, as in Bullitt or The French Connection; or a race, or competition, or fight, fed by revenge, as in Kill Bill I and II (Quentin Tarantino); or the shoot-out on a farm that makes up the last act of Witness. Emotional action is what happens inside your characters during the story. Emotional action is the center of the drama in Cold Mountain, Love Story, The Royal Tenenbaums, American Beauty, and Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola). The emotional context of the great Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni’s films makes up the internal action in masterpieces like Blow-Up, L’Avventura, L’Eclisse, and La Notte. The search for the correct way to live in our times is the centerpiece of the maestro’s oeuvre. As you can see, most films contain both kinds of action, physical and emotional.

		Ask yourself what kind of story you are writing. Is it an outdoor action-adventure movie, or is it a story about a relationship, an emotional story? Once you determine what kind of action you’re dealing with, you can move into the life of your character.

		First, define the dramatic need of your character. What does your character want? What is his/her need? What drives him to the resolution of your story? In Chinatown, Jake Gittes’s need is to find out who set him up, and why. In The Bourne Supremacy (Tony Gilroy), Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) needs to know who wants to kill him, and why. You must define the need of your character. What does he/she want?

		Sonny (Al Pacino) holds up the bank in Dog Day Afternoon to get money for a sex-change operation for his male lover. That is his need. If your character creates a system to beat the tables in Las Vegas, how much does he need to win before he knows if the system works or doesn’t? The need of your character gives you a goal, a destination, an ending to your story. How your character achieves or does not achieve that goal becomes the action of your story.

		As I said before, and will say again, all drama is conflict. If you know the need of your character, you can create obstacles to fulfill that need. How he/she overcomes those obstacles is your story. Conflict, struggle, overcoming obstacles, both inside and outside, are the primary ingredients in all drama—in comedy, too. It is the writer’s responsibility to generate enough conflict to keep the reader, or the audience, interested. The job of the screenwriter is to keep the reader turning pages. The story always has to move forward, toward its resolution.

		And it all comes down to knowing your subject. If you know the action and character of your screenplay, you can define the need of the character and then create obstacles to that need. The dramatic need of The Bride (Uma Thurman) in Kill Bill is simply revenge. It is the fuel that feeds the story engine.

		In Midnight Cowboy, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) comes to New York to hustle women. That is his need. It is also his dream. And, as far as he’s concerned, he’s going to make a lot of money and satisfy a lot of women in the process.

		What are the obstacles he immediately confronts? He gets hustled by Ratso (Dustin Hoffman), loses his money, doesn’t have any friends or a job, and the women of New York don’t even acknowledge his existence. Some dream! His need collides head-on with the harsh reality of New York City. That’s conflict.

		Without conflict, there is no action. Without action, there is no character. Action is Character. What a person does is what he is, not what he says!

		When you begin to explore your subject, you will see that all things are related in your screenplay. Nothing is thrown in by chance, or because it’s cute or clever. “There’s a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow,” Shakespeare observed. “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction” is Newton’s Third Law of Motion, a natural law of the universe. The same principle applies to your story. It is the subject of your screenplay.

		KNOW YOUR SUBJECT!



* * *



		—

		As an exercise, find a subject you want to explore in screenplay form. If need be, look through the daily newspaper to see if a person, or incident, or situation grabs your attention. Think about how you might want to structure your story, then reduce it to a few sentences in terms of action and character, then write it out. Remember, it may take you a few pages to find out what you want to do, and another page or two to clarify it, but then you’ll be able to eliminate the unnecessary and focus on your subject.

		The Creation of Character


		 			“What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			—The Art of Fiction

			Henry James





What is Character?

		That’s a question that has haunted literary theorists from the beginning of the written word. The challenge of creating real people in real situations is so varied, so multifaceted, so unique, so individually challenging, that trying to define how you do it is like trying to hold a bundle of water in your hands. Generation after generation of noted writers, from Aristotle to Aeschylus, from Ibsen to Ionesco, from Eugene O’Neill to Arthur Miller, have struggled to capture the art and the craft of creating good characters.

		One of the most articulate literary theorists of the nineteenth century was the great American novelist Henry James, author of Portrait of a Lady, Wings of the Dove, Turn of the Screw, and Daisy Miller, among other masterworks. James was fascinated with the art of fiction writing, and approached it like a scientist, the same way his brother, William James, the famous psychologist, studied the dynamics of the human mind. Henry James wrote several essays trying to document and define the intricacies of creating character. In one of those essays, The Art of Fiction, James poses a literary question: What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?

		It’s a profound statement.

		The key word, of course, is incident. According to the dictionary, an incident is “a specific occurrence or event that occurs in connection or relationship to something else.” Screenplays are usually about a key incident, and the story is the character acting and reacting to it. It is the major source of all action and all character. After twenty-five years of reading and analyzing screenplays and movies, I have only recently begun to understand the importance of the incident. All good movies, it seems, focus on the unfolding of a specific incident or event; and it is this incident that becomes the engine that powers the story to its completion.

		Frodo’s assuming the mantle of ring bearer in Lord of the Rings is the key incident in that film; as is Lester Burnham’s seeing the young girl Angela in American Beauty; as is Jake Gittes’s being confronted by the real Mrs. Mulwray in Chinatown. Sometimes incidents and events in our lives bring out the best in us, or the worst. Sometimes we recover from these events and sometimes we don’t—but they always impact us. At other times how we act and react, or deal with a particular situation, reveals our “true” nature and tells us who we really are. Miles in Sideways is a good illustration of that. When he is saving his special bottle of wine for a “special occasion,” he sees he doesn’t have a special time or place for opening it. So he sits alone, in a fast-food joint, hiding his bottle of wine.

		Events in a screenplay are specifically designed to bring out the truth about the characters so that we, the reader and audience, can transcend our ordinary lives and achieve a connection, or bond, between “them and us.” We see ourselves in them and enjoy a moment, perhaps, of recognition and understanding.

		In The Art of Fiction, Henry James says that the incidents you create for your characters are the best ways to illuminate who they are—that is, reveal their true nature, their essential character. How they respond to a particular incident or event, how they act and react, what they say and do is what really defines the essence of their character.

		How can we relate this concept to the process of creating character?

		Thelma & Louise (Callie Khouri) is a story about two women who kill a man, then attempt to flee the law and escape to Mexico, but get caught at the Grand Canyon and, rather than go to prison, choose to take their own lives. If you take a look at these two characters, they are two distinct, individual people who have the same dramatic need: to escape safely to Mexico. They are different aspects of each other, and they share everything, their life as well as their death. And during the course of their journey, we get to know them, love them, and wish that things might have been different.

		The reason why Henry James’s statement is so relevant is because the elements within the character really determine the incident; how the character reacts to that incident is what illuminates and truly defines his/her character. In Thelma & Louise, it’s set up immediately, at the beginning of Act I. Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) set out for a weekend holiday in the mountains, stop at a bar, and meet a guy named Harlan, who takes a liking to Thelma. He plies her with drinks, then attempts to rape her in the parking lot. It turns ugly, until Louise comes along, threatens Harlan with Thelma’s gun, and, when he mouths off to her, loses it, pulls the trigger, and kills him. Plot Point I. It is the key incident in the movie. Now the “real” story is about their attempt to escape to Mexico.

		As mentioned, Plot Point I is the true beginning of the screenplay and swings the story around into Act II. For the rest of the story, Thelma and Louise are on the run. As they race down the highway of their life, like so many other characters in so many other movies, they are forced to come to grips with themselves, find out who they really are, and ultimately take responsibility for their lives and actions. Thelma & Louise is a road movie, yes, but it’s really a journey of enlightenment, a journey of self-discovery. And it begins with the incident, the hub of the wheel of action.

		It is the character that determines the incident, in this case Louise’s killing Harlan, then fleeing in fear and uncertainty. What’s important for me, and you, as writers, is to ask what it was within Louise’s character that caused her to pull the trigger—because this incident is what ultimately reveals and illuminates the character. In Louise’s case, it is an incident that happened to her when she was a young woman; it’s only mentioned briefly, but it’s implied that she was raped in Texas and then brought charges against her attackers, but could get no satisfaction, no revenge, no justice. Indeed, instead of being seen as the victim, she was considered by many to have been the instigator. At that moment, she made a promise to herself: She would never take one step inside the state of Texas ever again. This decision ultimately brings about her death.

		Joseph Campbell reflects in The Power of Myth that in mythic terms, the first part of any journey of initiation must deal with the death of the old self and the resurrection of the new. Campbell says that the hero, or heroic figure, “moves not into outer space but into inward space, to the place from which all being comes, into the consciousness that is the source of all things, the kingdom of heaven within. The images are outward, but their reflection is inward.”

		It seems to me that the Louise in Act I who pulled the trigger, killing Harlan, is not the Louise who really killed him; rather, it was the young Louise, caught in the web of female justice, Texas style, who actually pulled that trigger. She never recovered from her experience, and it simmered in her consciousness below the thin veneer of time and memory, just waiting for a chance to erupt.

		Writers create characters in a variety of different ways. I once asked Waldo Salt how he went about creating characters, and he replied that the first thing he did was to choose a simple dramatic need; then he would add to it, coloring it until it became a universal chord common to Everyman. For Waldo, that became the essence of his character. And he was a master screenwriter, a major artist.

		What’s the best way to go about creating character? And how do you establish a relationship between your character, his or her dramatic choices, and the story you’re telling? How do you determine whether your character will drive a car, or ride a bicycle, or take the bus or subway, and what kind of paintings or posters hang in his/her house or apartment?

		Character is the essential internal foundation of your screenplay. The cornerstone. It is the heart and soul and nervous system of your screenplay. Before you can put one word down on paper, you must know your character.

		In a screenplay, the story always moves forward, from beginning to end, whether in a linear or nonlinear fashion. It doesn’t matter if it’s a story like Titanic or The Hours; Lord of the Rings or The English Patient (Anthony Minghella); The Shawshank Redemption or Memento (Christopher Nolan). The way you drive your story forward is by focusing on the actions of the character and the dramatic choices he or she makes during the narrative story line.

		So what is character? Action is character; a person is what he does, not what he says. Film is behavior. Because we’re telling a story in pictures, we must show how the character acts and reacts to the incidents and events that he/she confronts and overcomes (or doesn’t overcome) during the story line. If you’re writing your script and sense your characters are not as sharp or defined as you think they should be, and feel they should be stronger, more dimensional, and more universal in terms of thoughts, feelings, and emotions, the first thing you must determine is whether they’re an active force in the screenplay—whether they cause things to happen, or whether things happen to them.

		But first, who is your main character? Who is your story about? If your story is about three guys preparing to steal moon rocks, which one of the three is the main character? You have to know that. In Lord of the Rings, do you know who the main character is? Is it Frodo, Sam, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), or Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen)? Or is it all of them? If you aren’t sure, just ask yourself: Who is this story about? In Lord of the Rings, you could say, with good cause, that Aragorn is the main character because he leads the Fellowship, makes the decisions, and becomes the king. But take away all the trappings and the story is really about returning the ring to its place of origin, Mount Doom, so it can be destroyed. That’s what this story is about; therefore, Frodo is the main character. You can have more than one main character, of course, but it certainly clarifies things if you identify a single hero or heroine.

		Frequently a story is about what distinguishes the main character from the other characters. Who is the main character in The Shawshank Redemption? Red, the Morgan Freeman character, has the largest part of the movie, and he is the character telling us about Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins). But the story is really about Andy, so even though his part is not as large as Red’s, he is the main character because the story is about him. What about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Butch (Paul Newman) is the main character. He is the man making the decisions. Butch has a great line where he broaches one of his usual wild schemes to Sundance (Robert Redford), and Sundance just looks at him, doesn’t say a word, and turns away. And Butch mutters to himself: “I got vision and the rest of the world wears bifocals.” And it’s true. Within the context of that screenplay, Butch Cassidy is the main character—he is the character who plans things, who acts. Butch leads and Sundance follows. It is Butch’s idea to leave for South America; he knows their outlaw days are numbered, and to escape the law, death, or both, they must leave. He convinces Sundance and Etta Place to go with him. Sundance is a major character, not the main character. Once you establish the main character, you can explore ways to create a full-bodied, dimensional character portrait.

		There are several ways to approach creating your characters and all of them are valid, but you must choose the best way for you. The method outlined below gives you the opportunity of choosing what you want to use, or not use, in developing your characters.

		First, establish your main character. Who is your story about? Separate the components of his/her life into two basic categories: interior and exterior. The interior life of your character takes place from birth up until the time your story begins. It is a process that forms character. The exterior life of your character takes place from the moment your film begins to the conclusion of the story. It is a process that reveals character.

		Film is a visual medium. You must find ways to reveal your character’s conflicts visually. You cannot reveal what you don’t know. Thus, it’s important to make the distinction between knowing your character as a thought, notion, or idea in your head and revealing him or her on paper.

		Diagrammed, it looks like this:





		The Character Biography is an exercise that reveals your character’s interior life, the emotional forces working on your character from birth. Is your character male or female? If male, how old is he when the story begins? Where does he live, what city or country? Where was he born? Was he an only child, or did he have brothers and sisters? What kind of childhood did he have? Happy? Sad? Physically or medically challenging? What was his relationship to his parents? Did he get into a lot of trouble as a kid? Was he mischievous? What kind of a child was he? Outgoing, an extrovert; or studious, an introvert?

		When you begin formulating your character from birth, you begin to see your character build. Pursue his/her life through the first ten years; include his/her preschool and school years, relationships with friends and family and teachers. Did a single parent raise your character? Mother or father? Aunt or uncle? How did they get along? Is your character streetwise or sheltered? What kind of jobs did the parent(s) have to make ends meet?

		Move into the second ten years of your character’s life, ages ten to twenty. That means middle and high school. What kind of influences did your character have while growing up? Friends? What kind of interests? School, athletics, social, political? Did your character take an interest in extracurricular or after-school activities, like a debating club? What about sexual experiences? Relationships with peers? Did your character have to work part-time during high school? What about any sibling relationships? Any envy or hostility present? In other words, you want as much information as you can get about your character as he/she is growing up. What about relationships with teachers? What kind of relationship did your character have with his/her parents during these years? Did any major traumatic event happen that may have emotionally influenced your character? In high school, what kind of experience did he/she have? Did he/she have many friends or just a few friends? Did he/she feel like an outsider? Take a look at Mean Girls (Tina Fey). The whole film is built around feeling unpopular.

		Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia deals with the themes of reconciliation and forgiveness, revealing how parents’ actions shape and influence their children. (Ibsen’s great play Ghosts deals with the same themes, with how the sins of the father are passed on to the son.) In Magnolia, Earl (Jason Robards) is on his deathbed and confesses his sins, attempting to forgive himself for walking out on his dying wife and son, thus leaving the then fourteen-year-old Frank (Tom Cruise) to care for his dying mother alone. That incident has affected Frank’s entire life and led him to develop a lifestyle where he seeks to convince men that sex is a weapon that can be used to “destroy the opposite sex.” By confronting Earl on his deathbed, Frank is able to complete his relationship with his father before he dies.

		Move into the college years. Did your character go to college, or even consider college? What college or university did he or she go to? What was his or her major? Was your character active politically? Did he or she join clubs or student body organizations? Did your character have a significant relationship while in college? What happened in this relationship? How long were they together? Did they get married? When the story begins, is your character married, widowed, single, separated, or divorced? If married, for how long and to whom?

		Continue to trace your character’s life until the story begins. Examine his/her career, relationships, dreams, hopes, and aspirations. Many times reality collides with dreams and fantasies and generates a sense of conflict within the character’s life. Ask yourself questions; be observant; notice your own friends, family, and acquaintances. Sometimes you can use the information you observe in a slightly different form.

		Remember, you are not your character. You do not have the same name, same situation, or same birth date. The time frame of events you want to write about may have to be modified to gain greater insight into the character. You may share certain similarities with the character, but if you think you’re going to use yourself as the model, it’s not going to work. Writing is the ability to ask yourself questions and wait for the answers. As a side note, it’s important to phrase your creative questions to begin with the word what, not why. What implies a specific response; if you ask yourself a question beginning with the word why, you can get many different answers, and they may all be correct. So try to phrase any questions using the word what: What causes my character to react in this manner? (Not: Why does my character do this?) What is the purpose of this scene? It may take a while to phrase the question, and the answer may not appear as soon as you would like it to, but trust the process; it’s bigger than you are. That’s why I call writing a character biography creative research. You’re asking questions and getting answers. You’re building the interior life of your character, the emotional life, on a firm foundation so that your character can move and evolve in a definite character arc through the story, can change and grow through certain emotional stages of the action. It’s not very often that characters will be the same at the beginning of a story as they are at the end; their thoughts and feelings will probably change during the emotional through line of the action.

		Once you’ve established the interior aspect of your character in a character biography, you can move into the exterior portion of your story.

		The exterior aspect of your character takes place during the actual time of the screenplay, from the first fade-in to the final fade-out. It is important to examine the relationships in the lives of your characters, as they have the potential of becoming a resource for greater depth of character, including subplots, secondary actions, and any possible intercutting you may want to do to build the relationship between characters and story.

		How do you make your characters real, believable, and multidimensional people during your story? From fade-in to fade-out?

		The best way to do this is to separate your characters’ lives into three basic components—their professional life, their personal life, and their private life. These areas of your characters’ lives can be dramatized over the course of the screenplay.

		Professional: What does your main character do for a living? You need to know this. As mentioned, if you don’t know your character, who does? Where does he or she work? Is she the vice president of a bank? A construction worker? A doctor? A sound technician? A scientist? A professor? The clearer you are, the more believable your characters become. Are they sad or happy with their lives? Do they wish their lives were different—another job, or another wife, or possibly another self? In Michelangelo Antonioni’s The Passenger, David Locke (Jack Nicholson) finds a dead man and decides to take his identity, not knowing what his destiny will be. Sometimes we wish for what the other person has.

		Go into your character’s workplace and start defining the people that he or she interacts with on a daily basis; his/her boss, the various assistants, secretaries, salesmen, corporate heads, and so on. Define the relationships with coworkers. Are the relationships good, bad, supportive, happy, or sad; are there any conflicts in the relationships? If so, what are they about? Professional jealousy, anger, different personality types? How does your character deal with it? With argument and discussion? Or by silence and withdrawal? By launching personal attacks?

		If your character works in an office environment, what is his/her job description? Who is his/her strongest supporter? How well do the two of them get along? Do they confide in each other? Socialize with each other during off hours? How does she get along with her boss? Is it a good relationship, or is there some resentment because of the way things are going in the office, or pending mergers or buyouts, or possible looming salary cutbacks and layoffs?

		In a free-association essay of about a page or two, define your character’s professional life. Don’t try to censor yourself; just throw it all down on the page. When you can describe and explore the relationships of your main character with the other people in his/her professional life, you’re creating a personality and a point of view. And that’s the starting point of building and broadening and enhancing the richness of your character’s life.

		Personal: Is your main character married, single, widowed, divorced, or separated? Is your character in a relationship when the story begins? If so, who is he/she with and how long have they been together? If your character is married, whom did he or she marry? Someone he met at school, or dated, or was fixed up with? Is the person your character is with when the story begins from the same background as she or do they come from “different sides of the tracks”? Above or below him/her in terms of education or profession? Childhood sweethearts? College lovers? How long have they been married? What does the marriage look like? Here’s where the length of the marriage comes in. If they have recently married, their relationship is different from that of a couple who have been married for several years. Do they go places, do things together? Or do they take each other for granted? Do they have many friends and participate in social functions, or do they have only a few friends? Is the marriage strong, or is your character thinking about, or participating in, extramarital affairs?

		Finding ways to illustrate and reveal your character’s relationships are challenging, but rewarding. Think about conflicts; he may want one thing, she another. It may be as important as whether or not to have children, or simply that he likes sporting events and she likes the theater. Go into this marriage and write it out. You can do this as it applies to your individual screenplay, either as a background relationship or in the foreground, as part of the action.

		My favorite film marriage is seen in Citizen Kane. Kane’s marriage is revealed in one incredible sequence, which begins with the marriage and honeymoon of Kane and his first wife. In the next cut, we see them at breakfast having an intimate conversation. There is a swish pan (the camera swishes quickly out of the frame) and we see them in different clothes talking and reading the paper at breakfast. Swish pan and we see them at a slightly larger table having a very heated discussion. Swish pan to them having a more vocal argument about his spending so much time at his newspaper. Swish pan to them at a much larger table, both silent, both reading the paper, he reading the Inquirer, she reading the Post, his primary competitor. She asks him something and he simply grunts in reply. Swish pan to them at a very long table eating in total silence. A significant period of time covered in about a minute. The sequence tells us so much about their relationship, and it’s all done in brief shots, using pictures instead of words. A screenplay, remember, is a story told with pictures.

		If your character is single, what is his/her single life like? Dating many people, or getting somewhat serious about someone? If he or she is alone when the story begins, when was his/her last relationship? Was it serious or just a three-month fling? What are his/her likes or dislikes? If your character is seeing someone when the story begins, how long have they been together? Any conflicts in the relationship? What do they disagree about? What do they have in common? Any ex-girlfriends or ex-boyfriends in the equation? How do they work it out? Any other areas they have conflicts in? In terms of a relationship, is she/he ready to move into some kind of commitment?

		Is she divorced? If yes, how long was she married? To whom? What really happened that caused the breakup? How long were they together? Any children? If yes, how often does she see the kids? And how do the children feel about the divorce or someone new that one of their parents might be seeing?

		All these aspects of your character’s relationships should be explored, thought about, written about. When you have doubts about your character, go into your own life. Ask yourself—if you were in that situation, what would you do in your character’s place? This is not to say that you are your character. You may have certain things in common with your character, but I’ll say it again: You are not your character.

		Define the personal relationships of your character in a page or two. In free-association or automatic writing, just throw down all your thoughts, words, and feelings on the page, and don’t worry what it looks like or reads like. No one is going to see this but you.

		Private: What does your character do when he or she is alone? Watch a lot of TV? Exercise—training for a triathlon competition? Is he into sports, and goes to the gym three times a week? Does she jog, do yoga, or take spinning classes? Take a creative writing class one night a week? Does she have any pets? What kind? What hobbies does your character have? Does he/she collect stamps, garden, or take cooking classes? The private aspect covers the area of your character’s life when he/she is alone.

		What’s so beneficial about knowing your characters’ professional, personal, and private lives is that you have something to cut away to; if you are writing your screenplay and don’t know what happens next, you can go into the professional, personal, or private aspects of your character’s life and find something to show to move the story forward.

		Aristotle says in the Poetics: “Life consists in action and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.” That means your character has to be active, has to be doing things, causing things to happen, not just reacting all the time. Sometimes it’s necessary for your character to react to a situation, but you can’t have your main character constantly reacting only to things that happen to him. If that happens, he disappears off the page, and your story appears soft, without an edge. Your character is what he/she does. Film is a visual medium, and the writer’s responsibility is to choose an image, or picture, that cinematically dramatizes his or her character. You can create a dialogue scene in a small and stuffy hotel room, or have the scene occur at the beach or under the stars. One is visually closed; the others visually open and dynamic. It’s your story, your choice.

		If we wanted to diagram the concept of character, it would look like this:





		ACTION IS CHARACTER.

		Film is behavior. We can know a lot about characters by how they react, or behave, in certain situations. Pictures, or images, reveal different aspects of character. Whereas character reveals the deep-seated nature of who people are, in terms of values, actions, and beliefs, characterization is expressed in the way people live, the cars they drive, the pictures they hang on the wall, their likes and dislikes, what they eat, and other forms of individual character expression. Character is expressed in who they are, by their actions and reactions, by their creative choices. Characterization, on the other hand, is expressed in their taste and how they look to the world, what they wear, the cars they drive.

		Form your characters by creating a character biography, then reveal them by showing who they are in the professional, personal, and private aspects of their lives.

		How powerful and effective can the character biography be? It is a tremendous tool, revealing insights about the main character and the source of possible conflict. The character biography can be used effectively within the body of the screenplay. Occasionally things happen while you’re writing your character biography in free association and events leap off the page at you. Sometimes you can include these incidents or events in the screenplay. In The Royal Tenenbaums, the first few pages of the screenplay set up the characters; the Narrator tells us the family history in a very novelistic approach: “Royal Tenenbaum bought the house on Archer Avenue in the winter of his thirty-fifth year….Over the next decade, he and his wife had three children, and then they separated….” As the narrator gives us this information, we see the three children growing up. It sets the tone for the entire film, about family, failure, and forgiveness.

		“What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?” says Henry James.

		In Seabiscuit, there are four main characters: Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), and the horse, Seabiscuit. All of them have lost something: Tom Smith lost his freedom; Charles Howard lost his young son; Red Pollard lost his parents when he was “given away” during the Depression; Seabiscuit was deemed unworthy and given away when he was six months old. The film traces the journey of these four characters and their search for belonging, not only for themselves, but for the country at large. During America’s Depression in the 1930s, these three men and this horse inspired the entire country and gave people something to cheer about, to feel good about.

		What’s the value of creating a character biography? Look at Seabiscuit: The Narrator tells us that Seabiscuit “was the son of Hard Tack, sired by the mighty horse Man o’War…but the breeding did little to impress anyone….At six months he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons….Fitzsimmons decided the horse was lazy and felt sure he could train the obstinance out of him….When he didn’t improve, they decided the colt was incorrigible….They made him a training partner to ‘better’ horses, forcing him to lose head-to-head duels to boost the confidence of the other animal….When they finally did race him, he did just what they had trained him to do: He lost….By the time he was a three-year-old, Seabiscuit was running in two cheap claiming races a week. Soon he grew as bitter and angry as his sire Hard Tack had been….He was sold for the rock-bottom price of two thousand dollars….And, of course, it all made sense….Champions were large. They were sleek. They were without imperfection….This horse ran as they had always expected him to….”

		It took all four of them—Tom Smith, Charles Howard, Red Pollard, and Seabiscuit—to join forces as a team, each member an essential part of the whole, and become the pride and joy of America. “You know,” Red Pollard says in a voice-over at the end of the film, “everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him…but we didn’t….He fixed us. Every one of us. And, I guess in a way, we kind of fixed each other, too.”

		If you want to write a screenplay, decide who you are writing about. As an exercise, choose a character and write a character biography. Free-associate. Just throw down thoughts, words, or ideas. Don’t worry about grammar and punctuation. Write in fragments. You may want to start from birth but you don’t have to follow your character’s life in a linear form. Skip around if you have to; let your creative consciousness dictate the flow of character. Break your character’s life down into the first ten years, the second ten years, the third ten years, and beyond. Write about five to seven pages in free association, and if you choose, write more. When I write a character biography, I’ll write more than twenty pages, starting with my character’s parents and grandparents on both sides, and then I’ll even use past lives and astrology to get further insight into my character.

		After you’ve completed the character biography, think about your character’s professional life, personal life, and private life. Focus on the relationships that occur during the screenplay.

		KNOW YOUR CHARACTER.

		Building a Character


		 			 				“Amos Charles Dundee is a tall, broad-shouldered, rawboned man in his late thirties. Opinionated, strong-willed, quick-tempered, he is a realist who sees the world exactly as it is and can’t get enough of it. An artist, perhaps a sculptor of battle, who knows that for him death is as close as the owl perched upon the thigh of night. It is a very personal world to Amos Charles Dundee and win, lose, or draw, he will play it according to his needs and wants. Dundee is a soldier. He gives orders well and takes them badly….A wise man who can be a fool…who will go his own way come hell or high water and so far has yet to look back or regret…who so far has yet to fail.”

			—Major Dundee

			Sam Peckinpah, Oscar Saul





When I first began writing screenplays, I had the good fortune of hanging out with Sam Peckinpah during the time he was writing The Wild Bunch. His niece, Deneen Peckinpah, and I had both worked with Jean Renoir on the world premiere of his play Carola when we were students at UC Berkeley. When she came to L.A. seeking an acting career, she stayed with Sam at the beach.

		Since I was just starting out writing screenplays, I was like a sponge, absorbing as much as I could about the art and craft. It was during those summer months that I was blessed to be around the man who literally changed the style and impact of the Western film. I write a lot about this period and my relationship with Peckinpah in Going to the Movies.

		Sam was amazing—brilliant in his visual awareness, talkative when he felt comfortable, and, of course, moody and self-destructive when he was drinking too much or thought someone had gone behind his back or broken their word to him.

		Most of Sam’s films deal with characters who are dedicated or obsessed—take your pick—and caught in the maelstrom of changing times. He explored this theme, unchanged men in a changing time, in most of his films: Ride the High Country (N. B. Stone), Major Dundee (Oscar Saul), The Wild Bunch (Walon Green), The Ballad of Cable Hogue (John Crawford and Edmund Penny), Straw Dogs (David Zelag Goodman), The Getaway (Walter Hill), Junior Bonner (Jeb Rosebrook), Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (Rudy Wurlitzer), and others.

		When I first met him, I’d heard stories about his drunken antics, the difficulties he had on the set with his crew, his sense of “perfectionism,” the conflicts he had with the studios and producers, so I didn’t really know what to expect. I found him to be tough and honest, with a keen sensibility and understanding. He wasn’t drinking the “hard stuff,” he said, only two beers a day, and during our conversations I learned he had not made a film since Major Dundee, four years earlier.

		Cowritten with Oscar Saul, Dundee had been a traumatic experience for him. The studio had reneged on the contract and taken it away from him, recut it, and butchered it, even though he had “final cut” built into his contract. The title music, by Mitch Miller’s sing-along gang, was absolutely ridiculous. In his words, it had been a “personal disaster,” and it was while working on Dundee that he got the reputation of being “difficult”—meaning “unemployable” in Hollywood vernacular. Charlton Heston, Deneen told me, had returned his salary, and Peckinpah demanded that his name be taken off the credits, but the studio refused. He wanted to reshoot the opening sequence the way he had written it, but the studio said no. In effect, he was fired from his own film. He couldn’t get any work after that and was only now being given a chance to rewrite and direct The Wild Bunch by producer Phil Feldman.

		There were so many questions I wanted to ask him about writing a screenplay: I wanted to find out how he created and built his characters; what he looked for when he searched for a subject, or story, to write about; if he artificially created the story’s conflict, or if it was inherent in the story. The list went on and on, but I wanted to be cool, so I asked him only a few questions at a time. Sam was open and receptive and seemed to enjoy our conversations.

		He always found great visual metaphors that reflected the indicators of change and their impact upon the characters. I think that’s one of the ingredients Peckinpah brought to the contemporary Western: He showed us bits and pieces of character that reflected this theme of not belonging, of being “outside” and behind the times, and then wove these concepts into moments of visual action. Ride the High Country opens with a lone rider, Joel McCrea, riding into a town where a carnival is in full swing. Suddenly an antique Model T turns the corner and the driver, dressed in a long coat and goggles, starts honking angrily for McCrea to move out of the way. Then a camel bursts into view, followed by a horse, and the two race neck and neck to the finish line of a horse-and-camel race, the camel winning by almost a full length. In the opening sequence of The Wild Bunch, William Holden offers his arm to an elderly lady and helps her cross the street just before he and his gang rob the bank as a Temperance Parade gets under way.

		Late one afternoon, after Sam had finished his day’s writing on The Wild Bunch, we were enjoying a beer and watching the sun set when I asked how he structured his stories. He paused for a moment, then told me that he liked to “hang” his stories around a centerpiece. Typically, he said, he would build the action up to a certain event, about midway through the story, then let everything else be the result of that event. In The Wild Bunch it is the train robbery, done almost in total silence. It’s a magnificent sequence; once he sets up the story and characters, everything leads to the train robbery and the rest of the movie unfolds as a result of that sequence.

		We discussed it for a while, then he left the room and returned a few minutes later holding a script. It was the screenplay for Major Dundee. “Take a look at it,” he urged.

		The story takes place right after the Civil War and traces Dundee’s (Charlton Heston’s) relentless quest to track down the band of renegade Apaches and rescue the homesteader children who had been taken hostage during the massacre that opens the story. Dundee doesn’t care how he does it, or the price he inflicts upon others to achieve his goal. It’s Dundee’s obsession that drives his character through the narrative story line. That, I discovered, was his dramatic need. That’s what his purpose was, his mission, the engine that drove the story line.

		I read Major Dundee over and over again, taking notes, literally studying it as if I were preparing for a final exam. It was an incredible education. I began to see things: how Peckinpah structured and set up the story in the opening sequence, how he established the characters visually, then built the story to highlight the centerpiece—the ambush by the Apaches.

		When I was making documentaries for David Wolper, I understood the importance of having a strong opening scene or sequence, something that will immediately grab the attention of the reader or audience. Major Dundee opens with a Halloween party at an isolated ranch on the Western frontier just before the end of the Civil War; the music’s playing, the people are dancing, laughing, and having a good time, while costumed children run around outside, playing games. Then Sam cuts from the painted face of a child playing cowboys and Indians to the face of an Apache brave painted for war. Amid the music and dance, as children giggle and scream in joy and mock fright, the Apaches launch their attack, killing everyone and everything except the male children and the horses.

		It’s a remarkable opening, something I call “pure Peckinpah.” The contradiction between the images of the children in their Halloween costumes and the painted faces of the Apaches killing and scalping was horrifying. I marveled, too, at how Peckinpah introduces Major Dundee. The way he’s described in the stage directions tells us everything we need to know: “Opinionated, strong-willed, quick-tempered….An artist, perhaps a sculptor of battle, who knows that for him death is as close as the owl perched upon the thigh of night….He gives orders well and takes them badly….A wise man who can be a fool…who will go his own way come hell or high water…who so far has yet to fail.”

		I wanted to write characters like that. I wanted to enrich the characters in my screenplays so that they were fully formed and realized, multidimensional, real people in real situations. So I started asking myself questions: How do you take the idea of a person that exists in a scrambled, fragmented form and make him or her into a living, flesh-and-blood person, a person you can relate to and identify with? How do you go about putting life into your characters? How do you build character?

		As soon as I phrased the questions I knew there was no definitive answer—because building character is part of the mystery and magic of the creative process. It is an ongoing, never-ending, continuing practice. In order to really solve the problem of character, it’s essential to go into your characters and build the foundations and fabric of their lives, then add ingredients that will heighten and expand the portrait of who they are.

		So, I kept asking myself: What makes a good character? What is character? To find the answer, I needed to figure out what qualities we all have in common.

		When you think about it, underneath this skin of ours we’re really the same, you and I; certain things unite us. We share the same needs, the same wants, the same fears and insecurities; we want to be loved, have people like us, be successful, happy, and healthy.

		When I went back to reread Major Dundee with this in mind, I started analyzing the characters in terms of their individual needs and wants.

		Reading it from this perspective, I saw four things, four essential qualities that seemed to go into the making of good characters: (1), the characters have a strong and defined dramatic need; (2), they have an individual point of view; (3), they personify an attitude; and (4), they go through some kind of change, or transformation.

		Those four elements, those four qualities, make up good character. Using that as a starting point, I saw that every main, or major, character has a strong dramatic need. Dramatic need is defined as what your main characters want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay. The dramatic need is what drives your characters through the story line. It is their purpose, their mission, their motivation, driving them through the narrative action of the story line.

		In most cases you can express the dramatic need in a sentence or two. It is usually simple and can be stated through a line of dialogue, if you choose; or it does not have to be expressed at all. But you, as writer, must know your character’s dramatic need.

		In Thelma & Louise, the dramatic need is to escape safely to Mexico; that’s what drives these two characters through the entire story line. In Cold Mountain, Inman’s dramatic need is to return home, and Ada’s is to survive and adapt to the conditions around her. In Lord of the Rings, as mentioned, it’s to carry the ring to Mount Doom and destroy it in the fire that created it.

		In Apollo 13 (William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert), the dramatic need is to return the astronauts safely to earth. But it didn’t start out that way. When the story began, the dramatic need of Apollo 13, the astronaut’s mission, was to walk on the moon; but that changed when the oxygen tank blew. The dramatic question then became not whether they were going to land on the moon but whether they would be able to survive and return safely to Earth.

		There are times that the dramatic need will change during the course of the story. If your character’s dramatic need does change, it will usually occur at Plot Point I, the true beginning of your story. In Thelma & Louise, Louise’s killing Harlan at Plot Point I forces the action into a new direction; instead of spending a weekend in the mountains, Thelma and Louise have now become fugitives from the law. Their dramatic need is to escape. In Dances With Wolves (Michael Blake), John Dunbar’s (Kevin Costner’s) dramatic need is to escape from the lunacy of the Civil War and go to the farthermost point of the frontier. But when he finally reaches his goal, Fort Sedgewick—Plot Point I—his dramatic need changes, and now he must learn how to adapt to the land and establish a relationship with the Sioux.

		What is your main character’s dramatic need? Can you define it in a few words? Articulate it? If you don’t know your character’s dramatic need, who does? You must know it. If you like, you can establish dramatic needs for other characters in the screenplay. The dramatic need is the engine that powers the character through the story line.

		The second thing that makes good character is point of view. Point of view is defined as the way a person sees, or views, the world. Every person has an individual point of view. Point of view is a belief system, and as we know, what we believe to be true is true. There’s an ancient Hindu scripture titled the Yoga Vasistha that states, “The World is as you see it.” That means that what’s inside our head—our thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories—is reflected outside, in our everyday experience. It is our mind, how we see the world, that determines our experience. As one Great Being puts it: “You are the baker of the bread you eat.”

		Point of view shades and colors the way we see the world. Have you ever heard phrases like: “Life is unfair,” “You can’t fight City Hall,” “All life is a game of chance,” “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” “Life is unlimited opportunity,” “You make your own luck,” or “Success is based on who you know”? These are all points of view. We all have points of view, singular and unique, individual to the personal experience and expression of each person. It should be mentioned that a point of view is acquired through personal experience.

		If your character is a parent, she/he could reflect a “parent’s” point of view. Or he/she could be a student and view the world from a “student’s” point of view. A housewife has a specific point of view. So does a criminal, terrorist, cop, doctor, lawyer, rich man, poor man—all present individual and unique points of view.

		Do you know what your character’s point of view is?

		Is your character an environmentalist? A humanist? A racist? Someone who believes in fate, destiny, and astrology? Does your character believe in voodoo or witchcraft, or that the future can be revealed through a medium or psychic? Does your character believe that the limitations we confront are self-imposed, like Neo in The Matrix? Does your character put his faith in doctors, lawyers, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times? His/her belief in Time, People, Newsweek, and the evening news?

		Point of view is an individual and independent belief system. I believe in God. That’s a point of view. Or, I don’t believe in God. That’s also a point of view. Or, I don’t know whether there is a God or not; that’s also a point of view. All three statements are true within the individual fabric of the character. There is no right or wrong here, no good or bad, no judgment, justification, or evaluation. Point of view is neither right nor wrong; it is as singular and distinctive as a rose on a rosebush. No two leaves, no two flowers, no two people are ever the same.

		The Native Americans believe the Earth is a living being. Therefore, all living things on this planet are part of Mother Earth, whether a human, tree, rock, animal, stream, or flower. All life is sacred. That’s a point of view.

		Your character’s point of view may be that the indiscriminate slaughtering of dolphins and whales is morally wrong because they are two of the most intelligent species on the planet, maybe smarter than man. Your character supports that point of view by participating in demonstrations and wearing T-shirts with Save the Whales and Dolphins on it.

		Look for ways your characters can support and dramatize their points of view. Knowing your characters’ points of view becomes a good way to generate conflict. If your characters believe in luck, they believe that there’s a chance they can win the lottery. But anyone who believes that it’s “fixed” is not going to waste a dollar on a pick.

		In The Shawshank Redemption, there’s a short scene between Andy and Red that reveals the difference in their points of view. After almost twenty years in Shawshank Prison, Red is cynical because, in his eyes, the concept of hope is simply a four-letter word. His spirit has been so crushed by the prison system that he angrily declares to Andy, “Hope is a dangerous thing. Drives a man insane. It’s got no place here. Better get used to the idea.” And it is Red’s emotional journey that leads him to the understanding that “hope is a good thing.” The film ends on a note of hope, with Red breaking his parole and riding the bus to meet Andy in Mexico: “I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams….I hope.”

		Andy has a different point of view; he believes that “there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone, that there’s a small place inside of us they can never lock away. Hope.” And that’s what keeps Andy going in prison, that’s what makes him sacrifice a week of his life in solitary, “the hole,” just so he can listen to an aria from a Mozart opera.

		The third thing that makes good character is attitude. Attitude is defined as a manner or opinion, and is a way of acting or feeling that reveals a person’s personal opinion. An attitude, differentiated from a point of view, is an intellectual decision, so it can, and probably will, be classified by a judgment: right or wrong, good or bad, positive or negative, angry or happy, cynical or naive, superior or inferior, liberal or conservative, optimistic or pessimistic. Being “right” all the time is an attitude; so is being “macho.” Voicing a political opinion is also an attitude; just look at the many opinions about the war in Iraq. In the same way, have you ever gone into a store to buy something and found yourself dealing with a salesperson who does not want to be there, has negative energy and thinks he/she is superior to you? That’s an attitude. Have you ever walked into a fancy restaurant not wearing the “right” clothes? It’s that kind of judgment, where someone is convinced he’s right and you’re wrong; judgments, opinions, evaluations all stem from attitude. It’s an intellectual decision one makes. Understanding your character’s attitude allows him/her to reach out and touch his/her humanity in an individual way. Is he/she enthusiastic about his/her life and job, or unhappy? We all know people who express different parts of themselves through their attitude; someone who feels the world owes them a living, or blames their lack of success on “who you know.”

		The Truth About Cats and Dogs (Audrey Wells) is a delightful romantic comedy that is entirely based on the characters’ attitudes. Abby (Janeane Garofalo) is a woman who lives by her attitude; her opinion is that all men want in a woman is a pretty face and a great body. This attitude governs her behavior throughout the entire film. And Nora (Uma Thurman) takes it for granted that she’s not very bright. She thinks of herself as the “dumb blonde” with the heart of gold. Both Abby and Nora have to learn that their attitudes are not their real selves. Their journey through the film is to accept themselves as they truly are.

		Sometimes it’s difficult to separate point of view from attitude. Many of my students struggle to define these two qualities, but I tell them it really doesn’t matter; when you’re creating the basic core of your character, you’re taking one large ball of wax and, in this case, pulling it apart into four separate pieces. The parts and the whole, right? Who cares whether one part is the point of view and another the attitude? It doesn’t make any difference; the parts and the whole are really the same thing. So if you’re unsure about whether a particular character trait is a point of view or an attitude, don’t worry about it. Just separate the concepts in your own mind.

		The fourth element that makes up good character is change, or transformation. Does your character change during the course of your screenplay? If so, what is the change? Can you define it? Articulate it? Can you trace the emotional arc of the character from the beginning to the end? In The Truth About Cats and Dogs, both characters undergo a change that brings about a new awareness of who they are. Abby’s final acceptance that she is really loved for who she is completes the character arc of the change.

		In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy has endured prison life for some nineteen years when he learns who actually murdered his wife and her lover. When the warden refuses to help him get a new trial and Tommy, the witness, is killed, he realizes the warden will never let him out. Andy had entered prison considering himself guilty, even though he hadn’t killed his wife and her lover; he was guilty, yes, as Red tells him, not of pulling the trigger, but of being a bad husband. Now that he has served “his time,” he realizes the moment has come for him to be free once again. It is his redemption. As we learn later, he’s been preparing to escape for years.

		Having a character change during the course of the screenplay is not a requirement if it doesn’t fit your character. But transformation, change, seems to be an essential aspect of our humanity, especially at this time in our culture. I think we’re all a little like Melvin (Jack Nicholson) in As Good as It Gets (Mark Andrus and James L. Brooks). Melvin may be complex and fastidious as a person, but his dramatic need is expressed toward the end of the film when he says, “When I’m with you I want to be a better person.” I think we all want that. Change, transformation, is a constant of life, and if you can impel some kind of emotional change within your character, it creates an arc of behavior and adds another dimension to who he/she is. If you’re unclear about the character’s change, take the time to write an essay in a page or so, charting his or her emotional arc.

		Again, it’s important to remember that when you’re writing a screenplay, the main character must be active; she must cause things to happen, not let things happen to her. It’s okay if she reacts to incidents or events some of the time, but if she is always reacting, she becomes passive, weak, and that’s when the character seems to disappear off the page. Minor characters appear more interesting than the main character and seem to have more life and flamboyance.

		Film is behavior; action is character and character, action; what a person does is who he is, not what he says.

		Thelma & Louise is a good example. The script sets up the two women by showing who they are. Louise is unmarried, a waitress, and has a boyfriend, Jimmy, a musician, who’s playing a gig on the road and hasn’t called her once in three weeks. She’s upset and resolves that she’s not going to be home when he returns. So she decides to go to a friend’s cabin in the mountains without telling him where she’s gone. When he does arrive home, she just won’t be there. He’ll get a taste of how it feels. That’s the backstory.

		Thelma, on the other hand, appears to be a “ditzy” housewife. Her kitchen is a mess, and her “breakfast” consists of little nibbles from a frozen candy bar, which she puts back in the freezer only to whip out again for another bite. What she does and how her kitchen looks reveal an aspect of her character; we see who she is by what she does, her actions.

		Her husband, Darryl (Christopher McDonald), an arrogant, egotistical fool, is a high school hero whose best years are behind him. He treats Thelma with so little respect that she has to lie to him so she can go away for the weekend with her friend. Even then, her guilt influences her to leave something in the microwave for him when he comes home from work. You get what you settle for in a relationship, Louise tells her. That’s the life and relationship that Thelma has chosen for herself.

		Act I sets up their relationship. When they pull into the parking lot of the Silver Bullet bar, during the first ten pages, we learn more about them in terms of their relationship with the men in their lives. By the time Harlan tries to rape Thelma, at the end of Act I, their characters have already been established. When Louise pulls the trigger, killing Harlan, their lives and destiny change. That’s Plot Point I. This incident makes them two fugitives on the run and alters and defines their characters.

		Killing Harlan is the incident that really determines their characters. Their flight to Mexico becomes a journey of insight and self-discovery that eventually leads to their deaths. Their destiny has been determined by their actions, and their actions have illuminated who they really are. They have burned their bridges and literally “run out of world,” as writer Callie Khouri says. There is no way back. You can’t step into the same river twice.

		The essence of character is action—what a person does is who he is. A friend of mine had the opportunity of flying to New York for a business interview. She had mixed feelings about going. The interview was for a prestigious and high-salaried job she wanted; but she didn’t know whether she was willing to move to New York. She wrestled with the problem for more than a week, then finally decided to go, packed her bags, and drove to the airport. But when she parked her car at the airport, she “accidentally” locked her keys inside the car—with the motor running. It’s a perfect example of action revealing character; it told her what she knew all along—she didn’t want to go to New York!

		A scene like that can illustrate a lot about your character.

		Is your character late, or early, or right on time for appointments? Does your character react to authority the way Woody Allen does in Annie Hall when he tears up his driver’s license in front of a policeman? Every action, every word of dialogue, every individual character trait expands our knowledge and comprehension of the character.

		One of Henry James’s theories is termed the Theory of Illumination. James said that if your character occupies the center of a circle and all the other characters he interacts with surround him, then each time a character interacts with the main character, the other characters can reveal, or illuminate, different aspects of the main character. The analogy he used was walking into a darkened room and turning on the floor lamps located in each corner. Each lamp illuminates a different part of the room. In the same way, different aspects of your main character can be illuminated by what other people say about him or her. This is how we know that Bob Harris, the Bill Murray character in Lost in Translation, is a movie star: He’s sitting at the bar, alone, when two guys start telling him how much they loved his movies, and wonder whether he did all his own stunts. In that one exchange, we learn he is an action star, one whose career seems to be on the decline.

		Sometimes during the writing process you’ll find that what doesn’t work often shows you what does. Once one of my students was writing a drama, complete with unhappy, or “tragic,” ending. But suddenly, at the beginning of the third act, his characters started acting “funny.” Gag lines started coming out, and the resolution became funny, not serious. Every time he sat down to write, the humor just poured out; he couldn’t stop it. He became frustrated, finally giving up in despair.

		He was almost apologetic when he came to me. In all honesty, he explained, he didn’t know what to do. I suggested that he sit down and start writing, that he let the words and dialogue come out as they wanted to. If it’s funny, let it be funny, I told him; just write and complete the third act. Then he could see what he had. If it was funny all the way through and he didn’t like it, all he had to do was put it in a drawer somewhere, file it away, and then go back and write the third act the way he’d wanted to in the first place.

		He did it, and it worked. He threw out the comedy version of the third act, then wrote it serious, the way he wanted to. The comedy was something he had to do, something he had to get out. It was his way of avoiding completing the screenplay. Phil Alden Robinson, writer-director of Field of Dreams (and many other films), told me that the same thing had happened to him, and that the exercise of writing it out, even though it might be totally wrong for the screenplay, was one of the most important things he learned from reading this book.

		Many times, writers on the verge of completing a project want to hold on to it and not finish it. After all, what are you going to do after it’s complete? Have you ever read a book and hated to finish it? You postpone reading the last few chapters or pages because you want to hang on to the pleasure it has given you. We all do it. Just recognize it as a natural phenomenon, and don’t worry about it.

		If this happens to you, simply write the material the way it comes out. See what happens. Writing is always an adventure; you never really know what’s going to come out.

		When you’re writing you’ll find it may take you about sixty pages before you make contact with your characters, before they start talking to you, tell you what they want to do and say. Once you’ve made contact and established a connection with them, they’ll take over. Let them do what they want. Trust your ability to exercise the choice of action and direction during the “words on paper” stage.

		Just don’t expect your characters to start talking to you from page one. It doesn’t work that way. Even if you’ve done your creative research and know your characters, you might have to experience some resistance before you break through and get in touch with them.

		Dialogue is really a function of character. If you know your character, your dialogue may very well flow easily with the unfolding of your story. Many people worry about their dialogue: It’s awkward, or stilted; all the characters sound alike; they’re constantly explaining things. Writing dialogue is a learning process, an act of coordination. The more you do it, the easier it gets.

		Dialogue serves two main purposes: Either it moves the story forward, or it reveals information about the main character. If the dialogue does not serve either one of these functions, then take it out. It’s okay for the first sixty pages of your first draft to be filled with awkward dialogue. Don’t worry about it—the last sixty pages will be smooth and functional because, again, the more you do it, the easier it gets. And afterward you can go back and smooth out the dialogue in the first part of the screenplay.

		The end result of all your work and research and preparation and thinking time will be characters who are authentic and believable, real people in real situations.

		And that’s what it’s all about.

		Story and Character


		 			“You don’t throw a whole life away just ’cause it’s banged up a little.”

			—Seabiscuit

			Gary Ross





One of my favorite screenwriting exercises when I was teaching at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College was “creating a character.” The entire class joined in creating a character, and out of that character came the idea for a story. Everyone participated, throwing out ideas and suggestions, and gradually a character began forming and we started shaping a story. It took a couple of hours, and we usually ended up with a solid character, and sometimes a pretty good idea for a movie.

		We had a good time, and it began a process that seemingly managed to parallel the symmetrical chaos of the creative experience. Creating a character is a process, and until you’ve done it, until you’ve experienced it, you’re more than likely to stumble around awkwardly like a blind man in a fog complaining about how things aren’t where they used to be.

		There are really only two ways to approach writing a screenplay. One is to get an idea, then create your characters to fit that idea. Three people stealing moon rocks from NASA in Houston is an example of this. You take the idea, then “pour” your characters into it: a down-and-out jockey getting an opportunity to ride in the Santa Anita Handicap, as in Seabiscuit; or a boxer getting the opportunity to fight the Heavyweight Champion of the World, as in Rocky; or a man holding up a bank to get money for a sex-change operation, as in Dog Day Afternoon; or an embittered Civil War mercenary captured by his enemies and transformed by their way of life, as in The Last Samurai; or a man setting out to break the Water Speed Record, as in The Run. In this scenario, you create the characters to fit the idea.

		Another way to approach a screenplay is by creating a character, then letting a need, an action, and, ultimately, a story emerge out of that character. Virginia Woolf in The Hours is a perfect example of this: a woman seeking a creative outlet in a stifling life. So is Alice, in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. Roman Polanski had an idea about a survivor during the Holocaust, and out of this idea emerged The Pianist. He found the memoirs of a survivor, and together with Ron Harwood forged a screenplay that was close to his own personal experience. Jane Fonda had an idea about a Vietnam veteran coming home, expressed it to her associates, and Coming Home was created. Sofia Coppola wanted to write a screenplay about loneliness, so she created a situation, then developed her characters, and Lost in Translation came into being. Create a character and you’ll create a story.

		How do we go about creating a character? We start from scratch. I ask a series of questions and the class responds with answers. I take the answers and shape them into a character. And, out of that character, a story emerges.

		Sometimes it works beautifully; we come up with an interesting character and a good dramatic premise for a movie. Other times it doesn’t work at all. But considering the limited time we have and the circumstances of the class, we don’t do too badly.

		The following is an edited and abridged version of a class that happened to work well. The questions I asked went from general to specific, from context to content. When you read it, you might want to substitute your own answers for the ones we selected and make the story your own.

		“Let’s create a character,” I tell the class. “I’ll ask questions, you supply the answers.”

		They agree to that, amid some laughter.

		“Okay,” I say, “how are we going to start?”

		“Boston,” a guy booms out from the back of the room.

		“Boston?”

		“Yeah,” he says. “He’s from Boston!”

		“No,” several women yell. “She’s from Boston!”

		“That’s okay with me,” I say, then ask if it’s okay with everyone else. They agree.

		“Okay.” Our subject is a woman from Boston. That’s our starting point.

		“How old is she?” I ask.

		“Twenty-four.” Several people agree.

		“No,” I say. Late twenties or early thirties. Why? someone asks. I reply that when you’re writing a screenplay, you’re writing it for someone, for a star, someone who is “bankable.” Right now, I would think of Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Halle Berry, Renee Zellweger. We move on.

		“What’s her name?” I ask.

		The name Sarah comes into my head, and we go with it.

		“Sarah what?”

		Sarah Townsend, I decide. A name is a name.

		Our starting point becomes Sarah Townsend, late twenties or early thirties, from Boston. She is our subject.

		Then we create the context.

		Let’s get her personal history. For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to give one answer to each question I ask. In class there are several answers given and I select only one. Feel free to disagree with them if you want; or make up your own answers, create your own character, your own story.

		“What about her parents?” I ask. “Who’s her father?”

		A doctor, we decide.

		Her mother?

		A doctor’s wife.

		“What’s her father’s name?”

		Lionel Townsend.

		What’s his background?

		We toss a lot of ideas around and finally end up with this: Lionel Townsend belongs to the upper strata of Boston society. Wealthy, smart, conservative, he attended medical school at Boston University, then went to St. Louis to do his internship at Washington University.

		What about Sarah’s mother? What was she before she became a doctor’s wife?

		A teacher. “Elizabeth’s her name,” someone remarks. Good. Elizabeth might have been teaching in St. Louis when she met Lionel, and she continues teaching grade school during the time he’s completing his medical school education. When he begins his medical practice back in Boston, she gets pregnant and gives up her teaching.

		“When did Sarah’s parents get married?” I ask.

		If Sarah’s in her late twenties, early thirties, her parents must have married in the early ’70s, either during or after the Vietnam War. They’ve been married more than thirty years. “How’d you figure that out?” someone asks.

		“Subtraction,” I reply.

		What’s the relationship between mother and father?

		Consistent, and possibly routine. For what it’s worth, I add, Sarah’s mother’s a Capricorn, her father’s a Libra.

		When was Sarah born?

		Early or mid ’70s. April, an Aries. Does she have any brothers or sisters? No, she’s an only child.

		Remember, this is a process. For every question asked there are many answers. If you don’t agree with them, change them to create your own character.

		What kind of childhood did she have?

		A lonely one. She wanted brothers and sisters. She was alone most of the time. She probably had a good relationship with her mother until she was in her teens. Then, as always between parent and child, things went haywire.

		What’s the relationship between Sarah and her father?

		Good, but strained. Possibly he wanted a son instead of a daughter, and to please her father, Sarah became a tomboy. Possibly Sarah is always trying to find a way to please her father, to earn his love and affection. Becoming a tomboy helps with this problem, but creates another one by antagonizing her mother. This will figure later in her relationships with men.

		Sarah’s family is like all other families, but we’re sketching in as much detailed conflict as we can for dramatic purposes.

		We’re beginning to grasp the dynamics of the Townsend family. So far, there’s not been too much disagreement, so we continue to explore the context of Sarah Townsend.

		I remark that many young women search for their father or for father figures throughout their lives, much in the way that many men search for their mothers in the women they meet. It’s interesting to use this as a foundation of character. Not that it happens all the time, but it does happen; therefore let’s be aware of it so that we can possibly use it to our advantage.

		There’s a lot of discussion about this. I explain that when you’re creating a character, you have to compile nuances that you can either use or not. I tell the class this exercise is based on trial and error: We’re going to use what works and discard what doesn’t.

		Her mother probably educates Sarah in the ways of the world and, no doubt, cautions her about men. She might tell her daughter, “You can never trust a man. They’re only after one thing—your body.” Or, “They don’t like a woman who’s too smart.” And so on and so on. What Sarah’s mother tells her may be true for some of you, or it may not be, I tell the class; use your own experience in creating a character.

		Perhaps at an early age Sarah expressed the desire to become a doctor, like her father, and her mother cautioned her against that, saying, “It’s a long, tough grind.” Maybe her mother is a person who wants to be right all the time, or a person for whom looking good, appearance, is everything, like Mary Tyler Moore’s character in Ordinary People (Alvin Sargent). Let’s move on. What kind of high school experience did Sarah have?

		Active, social, the beginnings of rebellion. She made good grades without having to work very hard for them. She had many friends, and was a leader in rebelling against many of the school’s restrictive policies. Her music tastes became eclectic and her parents endured these years with patience but not too much understanding.

		Most young people rebel, and Sarah’s no exception. She graduates and goes to Vassar, which pleases her mother, but decides she wants to major in political science because she wants to help change “the system.” This, of course, upsets her mother. Sarah is socially active, and has an affair with a graduate student in political science. Her actions, based on her rebellious nature, become part of her character—she has a unique point of view, a determined attitude. She graduates from college with a degree in political science.

		Now what?

		She moves to New York to get a job. Her father supports her in this move. Her mother does not; she’s upset. She believes Sarah’s not doing the things she “should” be doing—finding a stable career, possibly marrying and settling down, as befits an intelligent young woman from Boston.

		Remember, I add, drama is conflict. We’re searching for ways to generate tension in our material. I explain that the relationship between mother and daughter may be useful during the screenplay, or it may not be. Let’s see whether it works or not before we make any decision about it, I advise. The writer always operates from the position of choice and responsibility.

		Sarah’s move to New York is a major crossroads in our creation of character. So far, we’ve focused on the context of Sarah Townsend. Now we’re going to be creating content.

		Let’s define the exterior forces working on Sarah. Here’s the diagram:





		Let’s explore the exterior forces working on Sarah.

		At this point, someone suggests that we create a story using a war as backdrop or as the context of the story. We talk about that for a bit. I ask, Which war? The Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the war in Iraq (even the Korean War or World War II)—all of them, no matter in what period of history they occurred, would lend some background tension to our story. We discuss this.

		We decide it’s a good idea, and I suggest that we could use the Vietnam War as the background of the story. All it means is changing some of the background events and dates working on Sarah. We decide to try it and see what happens. The events we’ve created are still valid to some degree, and will not have to be changed radically. We change what we need to, get our time lines straight, and decide that Sarah leaves college and moves to New York in the early ’70s. So, we research the times.

		Slowly, the story begins to take shape. Sarah arrives in New York City in the spring in the early ’70s. What does she do? Gets an apartment. Her father sends her some money each month, and does not tell her mother; Sarah prefers it that way. Then what?

		She gets a job. What kind of job does she get?

		Let’s discuss that. We know basically the kind of person Sarah is: upper-middle-class, independent, free-spirited, rebellious, on her own for the first time and loving it. Committed to herself and her life. Let’s start getting more specific.

		New York, 1972. What are the exterior forces working on Sarah? Here’s where some research would come in handy.

		Nixon is in the White House. The Vietnam War still rages; the country is in a state of nervous exhaustion. Nixon goes to China. McGovern’s gaining in the presidential primaries and there’s hope “he might be the one.” George Wallace is gunned down in a shopping center. The Godfather is in release. Chinatown is in production.

		What kind of job would fit Sarah dramatically?

		A job working for a political campaign. Someone suggests Sarah could be working at the McGovern headquarters in New York. This is a point of discussion. (If we wanted to make this a contemporary story, using the war in Iraq as a background force, we could easily have Sarah working for John Kerry’s campaign. The context would be the same, only the content would change.) We talk about it. Finally, I explain that for me the job satisfies her rebellious nature; it reflects her first independent step away from home. It satisfies her activist political stance and draws upon her background as a political science major in college, and it gives her parents something to disapprove of—both of them. We’re going after conflict, right?

		From now on, through a process of trial and error, we’re going to be searching for a theme, or dramatic premise: something that will move Sarah in a particular direction to generate a dramatic action. The subject of a screenplay, remember, is an action and a character. We’ve got the character; now we’ve got to find the action.

		This is a hit-and-miss operation. Things are suggested, changed, rearranged; mistakes are made. I’ll say one thing, then contradict myself in the next sentence. Don’t worry about it. We’re after a specific result—a story. We’ve simply got to let ourselves find it.

		New York. 1972. An election year. Nixon versus McGovern. Sarah Townsend is working for the McGovern campaign as a paid staff member. Who are her parents voting for?

		What does Sarah discover about politics from her experience in the campaign?

		That politics aren’t necessarily clean or idealistic. Perhaps she discovers something illegal going on—would she do anything about it?

		Maybe something happens, I suggest, that creates a major political issue. Perhaps a friend of hers, someone she sees fairly regularly, resists the draft and flees to Canada. She might become involved in the movement to bring home the draft resisters.

		Remember, we’re building a character, creating context and content, searching for a story that will soon appear. Create a character and a story will emerge.

		Someone says Sarah’s father has a different point of view from hers—he feels draft resisters are traitors to their country and should be shot. Sarah would argue the opposite: that the war is wrong, immoral and illegal, and that the people responsible for it, the politicians, should be the ones taken out and shot.

		Suddenly, an amazing thing happens in the room. The air becomes tense, heavy with energy, as the fifty or so people in the class become polarized in their attitudes and points of view about something that happened several years before they were even born.

		Then someone yells out, “Watergate!” Of course! June 1972. Is that a dramatic event that would affect Sarah?

		Yes. Sarah would be outraged; it is an event that will generate, or stimulate, a dramatic response in her. It is a potential hook in our as-yet uncreated, untold, and undefined story. This is a creative process, remember, and confusion and contradiction are part of it.

		Two and a half years later, Nixon is gone, the war is almost over, and the issue of amnesty becomes paramount. Sarah, by virtue of her political involvement, has seen and experienced an event firsthand that will guide her to a form of dramatic resolution, as yet unknown. Sarah, we all realize, is a politically motivated person. Does it work? is my question. Yes.

		Would Sarah be motivated enough to enter law school and become an attorney? I ask.

		Everybody responds and we have a lot of discussion about this. Several members of the class don’t think it works; they can’t relate to it. That’s okay—we’re writing a screenplay. We need a character who is larger than life; I can see several actresses as the lead: Renee Zellweger, Scarlett Johansson, Charlize Theron. As the cliché goes, “It’s commercial,” whatever that means.

		When I was working at Cinemobile back in the ’70s, the first question my boss, Fouad Said, asked me about a script was “What’s it about?” The second question was “Who’s going to star in it?” And at the time I always answered the same thing: Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, etc. (Today, it would be Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Keanu Reeves, Matt Damon, etc.) That satisfied him. You’re not writing a screenplay in order to paper your walls with it. You’re writing it, I hope, to sell! And to do that you need a name, a star, especially in today’s market.

		You may like seeing a woman attorney from Boston as the main character in a movie or you may not. My only comment is that in this exercise, it works!

		To me, Sarah goes to law school for a specific reason—to help change the political system! A woman attorney is a good, dramatic choice. Does being a lawyer fit her character? Yes. Let’s follow it out, see what happens.

		If Sarah is practicing law, something could happen, an event or incident that would spark the germ of a story. People start throwing out suggestions. A woman from Boston remarks that Sarah could be involved in the busing issue. It’s a very good idea. We’re looking for a dramatic premise, remember, something that will trigger a creative response, a hook. Sarah could be working in military law to aid the draft resisters, one person remarks. Another says she might be working in the area of poverty law; or business law, or maritime law, or labor relations. The life of an attorney offers a large range of dramatic possibilities.

		That’s when it happens—someone mentions he recently heard a news story about a nuclear power plant. That’s it! I realize that’s what we’ve been searching for, the hook, the jackpot! Sarah could become involved with the issue of nuclear power plant safety. This is what we’ve been looking for, I say—an exciting, topical story issue; the hook, or gimmick, of our story line. I commit to the choice of Sarah’s becoming an attorney.

		Everyone now agrees. It’s time to expand the exterior forces working on Sarah and fashion our story into a dramatic narrative line.

		Suppose we take the premise that Sarah Townsend becomes involved with a movement to redesign safety standards at nuclear power plants. Perhaps she discovers through an investigation that a particular nuclear plant is unsafe. Politics being what they are, maybe a politician supports the plant despite the fact that it is unsafe.

		This becomes our story’s hook, or dramatic premise. (If you don’t agree, find your own hook!) Now we have to create the specifics, the details, the content, and we’ll have the subject for a screenplay—an action and a character.

		The screenplay would focus on the subject of nuclear power plant safety, a major political issue.

		What about the story?

		Recently, the authorities closed a nuclear power plant in Pleasanton, California, when they discovered it was situated less than two hundred feet from a major fault line, the epicenter of an earthquake. Can you imagine what would happen if an earthquake crumbled a nuclear power plant? Try to put your mind around that! Let’s create an opposite point of view. What would her father say about nuclear power plants? “Nuclear energy must work for us,” he might say. “In our energy crisis we have to think ahead, develop an energy source for the future; that future is nuclear energy. We have to insure strict safety standards and create rules and guidelines determined by Congress and the Atomic Energy Commission.”

		Now, as we all know, these guidelines might be based not on reality, but on political necessity. This might be something Sarah accidentally discovers—possibly a political favor that relates directly to an unsafe condition at a nuclear power plant. But something’s got to happen that will trigger the incident that sets the story in motion.

		Someone suggests that a person at the nuclear plant is contaminated and the case is brought to Sarah’s law firm, and that’s how she becomes involved.

		It’s a very good suggestion! We all agree that this is the dramatic story line we’ve been looking for: a worker becomes contaminated, the case is brought to Sarah’s firm, and she’s put on the case. The Plot Point at the end of Act I would come when Sarah discovers that the worker’s contamination, his fatal illness, is caused by unsafe safety procedures; when, despite threats and obstacles, she decides to do something about it.

		Act I is the Set-Up—we could open with the worker being contaminated. A visually dynamic sequence: The man collapses on the job and is carried out of the plant; an ambulance roars through the streets of the city. Workers gather, protest; union officials meet and decide to file suit for action that will defend the workers from unsafe conditions within the plant.

		By circumstances, situation, and design, Sarah is chosen to handle the case. Union officials don’t like it—she’s inexperienced and she’s a woman (it’s the late ’70s, remember), and they don’t think she’ll be able to handle the pressure. Sarah is determined to make this case her own and prove everybody wrong. The authorities deny her access to the plant, but she manages to explore it anyway and learns firsthand about the unsafe conditions. A brick is thrown through her window. Threats are made. The law firm can’t help her. She goes to political representatives, is given the runaround, told it’s the worker’s fault for getting contaminated.

		The media starts sniffing around. She learns there’s a political connection between safety standards and plant management. Maybe, someone says, they discover some missing plutonium. It’s a good thought, but another story, I reply.

		Sarah’s uncovering the political connection becomes the Plot Point at the end of Act I.

		Act II is the Confrontation. It’s that place in the story line where Sarah confronts obstacle after obstacle in her investigation—so many obstacles, in fact, that she suspects there’s some kind of political cover-up. She cannot ignore it any longer. We need to create someone for her to talk to, confide in; maybe a love interest. Perhaps she’s involved with a recently separated or divorced attorney with children. Their relationship becomes strained; he thinks she’s “crazy,” “paranoid,” “hallucinating,” and they may not be able to keep it together under the pressure of what she’s going through. If need be, here’s where we can write a two-page essay about Sarah’s relationship with men. (How many times has she been in love? What kind of person does she become involved with? And so on.)

		She will experience conflict and resistance from members of her law firm; she may be told she’s going to be removed from the case if she persists in her investigation. Her parents disagree with her, so she’ll have conflict there. The only people who will support and help her are the people who work at the nuclear power plant; they want her to succeed, to expose the unsafe working conditions. We can use the media, and possibly create a reporter who believes she should continue the investigation. He’s going to get a story out of it. Possibly there’s a romantic link between them.

		What about Plot Point II? It must be some kind of incident, episode, or event, remember, that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction.

		Perhaps the reporter comes to her with definite proof that there’s some kind of political link involving many officials. She has the facts in her hands—what is she going to do about it?

		Act III is the Resolution. Sarah, with the help of plant workers and the media, exposes political favoritism in the government’s regulation of nuclear power safety standards.

		The plant is closed until new safety standards are established. Sarah is congratulated on her persistent, courageous, and victorious stand.

		There are different kinds of endings. In “up” endings, things work out. Think of Erin Brockovich (Susannah Grant); Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King; Whale Rider (Niki Caro); and The Shawshank Redemption. In sad or ambiguous endings, it’s up to the audience to figure out what happens to the characters. For example, Clarissa (Meryl Streep) in The Hours; Bob and Charlotte (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) in Lost in Translation; Kill Bill II. In a “down” ending, not everything works out: American Beauty, The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma & Louise, Cold Mountain, Million Dollar Baby (Paul Haggis).

		If you’re ever in doubt about how to end your story, think in terms of a positive ending. We’re talking Hollywood here, and I think the purpose of art, or entertainment, is to entertain. That doesn’t mean that everybody lives happily ever after, but that people walk away from the theater uplifted, fulfilled, spiritually aligned with their own humanity. As with Jason Bourne searching for the fragments of his life in the The Bourne Supremacy, I believe the silver screen is a mirror, reflecting our thoughts, our hopes, our dreams, our successes, our failures.

		I once taught a workshop in Germany for some fifty writers, and out of fifty stories, forty-six of them ended in death, suicide, mayhem, and destruction. I told the students that there are better ways to end a screenplay than to have your character caught, shot, captured, die, commit suicide, or be killed. The best ending for your story is an ending that’s real, believable, and true, as in Seabiscuit, Magnolia, or Annie Hall. Titanic had a real, believable ending, in spite of its romanticism. Though money is no criterion of success, it is a criterion of just how many people saw the film and were entertained and uplifted by it. And it’s good to remember that the two things that run Hollywood are fear and greed. Everybody wants to be associated with a “winner.” That’s why weekend grosses are so important in the movie industry.

		Resolve your stories any way you want, but be true to your story and characters; if possible, look for the positive, uplifting aspect of the story. A case in point is Sideways. In my opinion, it is a beautiful film, well made, well acted, well executed in every aspect, and it leaves us with the hope and possibility that Miles and Maya (Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen) may get back together. You might disagree with that and say that life is not like that, but that’s only a point of view. We’re not talking “life” here; we’re talking movies, entertainment.

		Which brings us back to our story and Sarah Townsend. And even though the story, at this point, is thin in terms of character and action, we have enough information to start preparing our screenplay.

		Here, then, is our story: In the ’70s, a young woman attorney discovers unsafe working conditions at a nuclear power plant and, despite political pressure and threats to her life, succeeds in exposing political corruption. The plant is shut down until repairs are made and safe conditions exist to protect the workers and the surrounding community.

		Not too bad—considering it took us only a couple of hours to create a character and a story! We even put a working title on it: Precaution!

		We have an interesting main character: Sarah Townsend; and an action: uncovering a political scandal involving a nuclear power plant. We have the four points needed to anchor our story line; the ending: Sarah exposing the political corruption; and the beginning: a nuclear power plant worker becoming contaminated. Plot Point I is when they discover the unsafe conditions, and there’s a good source of potential conflict in Act II. The Plot Point at the end of Act II comes when Sarah finds the proof that there is a definite political link to the unsafe conditions at the plant.

		You may not agree with it or like it—it doesn’t matter. The purpose of the exercise is to set into motion a process, to show you how creating a character can generate a dramatic action that leads to a story. Many films, such as Erin Brockovich, are structured this way.

		As I said at the beginning of this chapter, there are two ways to approach writing your screenplay: One is to create an idea, then create your characters and “pour” your characters into the action. The second way is to create a character and then let the action, the story, emerge out of character. That’s what we’ve just done.

		It all came out of “a young woman from Boston.”

		Try it! See what happens.

		Endings and Beginnings


		 			“Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown.”

			—Chinatown

			Robert Towne





Question: What’s the best way to open your screenplay?

		What scene or sequence would best capture the attention of the reader or audience? Showing your character at work? In a tight or tense dramatic action? A chase scene while delivering pizza? In the heat of passion in a relationship? Arriving at work? Preparing for a day in court? Jogging? In bed, alone, or having passionate sex with someone? Driving down the long, lonely highway as day breaks? Playing golf? Arriving at the airport?

		There are, of course, a myriad of different ways to begin your screenplay. Up until now, we’ve discussed various abstract principles in writing a screenplay in terms of action and character. At this point, we are leaving those general concepts behind and moving into more specific and fundamental parts, or components, of the screenplay.

		Let’s backtrack a little. All screenplays have a subject, and the subject of a screenplay is defined as the action—what happens—and the character—whom it happens to. There are two kinds of action—physical action and emotional action; a car chase and a kiss. We discussed character in terms of dramatic need, and broke the concept of character down into two components—interior and exterior; your character’s life from birth up until the time the movie ends. We talked about building character and creating characterization and introduced the idea of context and content.

		Now what? Where do we go from here? What happens next? Look at the paradigm:





		What do you see?

		Direction, that’s what; your story moves forward from point A to point Z, from set-up to resolution, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s told in bits and pieces of memory, as in The Bourne Supremacy; or in flashbacks, as in Cold Mountain, Annie Hall, or The English Patient; or in a straight linear story line as in The Pianist, Chinatown, Spider-Man 2 (Alvin Sargent), or The Matrix. Remember that the definition of screenplay structure is “a linear progression of related incidents, episodes, and events leading to a dramatic resolution.”

		That means your story moves forward from beginning to end. You’ve got approximately ten pages (about ten minutes) to establish three things to your reader or audience: (1) who is your main character? (2) what is the dramatic premise—that is, what’s your story about? and (3) what is the dramatic situation—the circumstances surrounding your story?

		So—what’s the best way to open your screenplay?

		KNOW YOUR ENDING!

		That’s the first thing you have to know: What is the ending of your story? Not the specific shot, scene, or sequence of how the script actually ends, but the resolution. Resolution means solution; how is your story resolved? What is the solution? Does your character live or die? Get married or divorced? Win the race or not? Return safely to Cold Mountain or not? Destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom or not? Get away with the robbery or not? Go back home or not? Find the criminals and bring them to justice or not?

		What is the resolution of your screenplay?

		A lot of people don’t believe that you need an ending before you start writing. I hear argument after argument, discussion after discussion, debate after debate. “My characters,” people say, “will determine the ending.” Or, “My ending grows out of my story.” Or, “I’ll know my ending when I get to it.”

		Sorry, but it doesn’t work that way. At least not in screenwriting. You can do that maybe in a novel, or play, but not in a screenplay. Why? Because you have only about 110 pages or so to tell your story. That’s not a lot of pages to be able to tell your story the way you want to tell it.

		The ending is the first thing you must know before you begin writing.

		Why?

		It’s obvious, when you think about it. Your story always moves forward—it follows a path, a direction, a line of progression from beginning to end. Direction is defined as a line of development, the path along which something lies.

		In the same way, everything is related in the screenplay, as it is in life. You don’t have to know the specific details of your ending when you sit down to write your screenplay, but you have to know what happens and how it affects the characters.

		I use an example out of my own life to illustrate this.

		There was a moment in my life when I didn’t know what I wanted to do or be. I had graduated from high school, my mother had just died, as my father had some years before, and I didn’t want to get stuck in some job or go off to college. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to travel around the country and see whether I could find a direction. My older brother was in medical school in St. Louis at the time, and I knew I could stay with him or visit friends in Colorado and New York. So, one morning, I packed my bags, got into my car, and headed east on Highway 66.

		I never knew where I was going till I got there. I preferred it that way. I had good times and bad times, and loved it; I was like a cloud on the wind, drifting without aim or purpose.

		I did that for almost two years.

		Then, one day, driving through the Arizona desert, I realized I had traveled that same road before. Everything was the same, but different. It was the same mountain in the same barren desert, but it was two years later. In reality, I saw I was going nowhere. I had spent two years trying to get my head straight, and I still had no purpose, no aim, no goal, no destination, no direction. I suddenly saw my future—it was nowhere.

		I became aware of time slipping away, almost like an acid trip, and I knew I had to do something. So I stopped wandering and went back to school. At least I’d have a degree after four years, whatever that meant! Of course, it didn’t work out the way I expected—it never does. But it was there, at Berkeley, that I met and worked with the man who would change my life forever: my mentor, Jean Renoir. “The future,” he told me, “is film.”

		When you go on a trip, you are going someplace; you have a destination. If I’m going to San Francisco, that’s my destination. How I get there is a matter of choice. I can fly, drive, take a bus or train, ride a motorcycle or bike, jog, hitchhike, or walk.

		I can choose how to get there. And life is choice—personal choices, creative choices—and learning how to take responsibility for them.

		Understanding the basic dynamics of a story’s resolution is essential. By itself, resolution means “a solution or explanation.” And that process begins at the onset, at the very beginning of the screenwriting process. When you are laying out your story line, building it, putting it together, scene by scene, act by act, you must first determine the resolution. What is the solution of your story? At the moment of the initial conception of your screenplay, when you were still working out the idea and shaping it into a dramatic story line, you made a creative choice, a decision, and determined what the resolution was going to be.

		Good films are always resolved—one way or another. Think about it.

		Do you remember the ending of Rushmore? Finding Nemo? Spider-Man 2? The Matrix? Bonnie and Clyde? Red River? Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? The Treasure of the Sierra Madre? Casablanca? Annie Hall? Coming Home? Jaws? American Beauty? An Unmarried Woman? The Searchers? Terminator 2: Judgment Day? These are universally acclaimed films.

		A good illustration is Robert Towne’s Chinatown. One of the true film classics, it incorporates great writing, great filmmaking, and great acting. I’ve seen Chinatown more than thirty times over the years and it still stands up; it’s an act of discovery each time I see it. The history of the script is intriguing: There were three drafts of the screenplay, and three different endings.

		The first draft of Chinatown is much more romantic than the others. In this draft, Robert Towne has Jake Gittes opening and closing the story with a voice-over narration, just the way Raymond Chandler does in most of his stories. When Evelyn Mulwray walks into Jake Gittes’s life, he becomes involved with a woman from a different class; she is wealthy, sophisticated, and beautiful, and he falls head over heels in love with her. Near the end of the story, when she learns that her father, Noah Cross (John Huston), has attempted to hire Gittes to find her daughter/sister, she realizes that her father will stop at nothing to get the girl, so she sets out to kill him. She knows it’s the only solution. She phones Noah Cross and tells him to meet her along a deserted part of the coast near San Pedro. When Cross arrives, it is raining heavily, and as he walks up the dirt road looking for his daughter, she jams down her car’s accelerator and tries to run him over. He narrowly escapes and races to a marshy area nearby. Evelyn leaves the car, pulls a gun, and begins tracking him. Shots are fired. He hides behind a large wooden sign advertising fresh bait. Evelyn sees him and fires again and again into the sign. Blood mingles with the falling rain and Noah Cross falls over backward, dead.

		A few moments later, Gittes and Lieutenant Escobar arrive at the scene and we cut to various shots of modern-day Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Gittes, in voice-over narration, tells us that Evelyn Mulwray spent four years in prison for killing her father, that he managed to get her daughter/sister safely back to Mexico, and that the land scheme Noah Cross so brilliantly conceived resulted in a profit of about $300 million. The resolution of this first draft is that justice and order prevail: Noah Cross gets what he deserves, and the graft and corruption of the water scandal leads to Los Angeles becoming what it is today.

		That was the first draft.

		At that point, Robert Evans, the producer (and the man responsible for The Godfather and Love Story), brought in Roman Polanski (The Pianist) as director. Polanski had his own ideas about Chinatown. Changes were discussed, then made, and the relations between Polanski and Towne became tense and strained. They disagreed about many things, mostly about the ending. Polanski wanted an ending in which Noah Cross got away with murder. The second draft is therefore altered considerably. It is less romantic, the action is trimmed and tightened, and the focus of the resolution changed substantially. The second draft is very close to the final one.

		In this second draft, Noah Cross gets away with murder, graft, and incest, and Evelyn Mulwray becomes the innocent victim who pays for her father’s crime. Towne’s point of view when he began writing Chinatown is that those who commit certain types of crimes, like murder, robbery, rape, or arson, are punished by being sent to prison, but those who commit crimes against an entire community are often rewarded by having streets named after them or plaques dedicated to them at City Hall. Los Angeles literally owes its survival to the water scandal known as the Rape of the Owens Valley, and it provides the backdrop of the film.

		The ending of the second draft now has Gittes planning to meet Evelyn Mulwray in Chinatown; he has arranged for her to be taken to Mexico by Curly (Burt Young), the man in the opening scene, and her daughter/sister is waiting at the boat. Gittes has discovered that Cross is the man behind the murders as well as the water scandal, and when Gittes accuses him, Cross takes him prisoner. They leave for Chinatown, and when they arrive, Cross tries to detain Evelyn, but Gittes manages to subdue the older man. Evelyn races to her car, only to be blocked by Lieutenant Escobar. Gittes makes a drastic move and lunges at the policeman; during the scuffle, Evelyn drives away. Shots are fired and she is killed, shot in the head. This is close to the final draft.

		The last scene shows Noah Cross weeping over Evelyn’s body while a stunned Gittes tells Escobar that Cross is the man responsible for everything.

		In the third, and final, draft, the ending has been modified slightly to accent Towne’s point of view, but the resolution is still the same as in the second draft. Gittes is taken to Chinatown, but Lieutenant Escobar is already there, and arrests the private detective for withholding evidence, putting him in handcuffs. When Evelyn arrives with her daughter/sister, Cross approaches the young girl. Evelyn tells him to stay away, and when he doesn’t, she pulls a gun and shoots him in the arm. She gets into her car and drives off. There is a shot fired, and Evelyn is killed, shot through the eye. (As a side note, Sophocles has Oedipus tear out his eyes when he realizes he has committed incest with his mother. I find this an intriguing parallel, whether intentional or not.)

		Horrified by Evelyn’s death, Cross puts his arm protectively around his daughter/granddaughter and forcefully whisks her away into the darkness.

		“Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown.”

		Noah Cross, indeed, gets away with it all: murder, the water scandal, the girl. “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it,” Gittes tells Curly in the opening scene.

		The resolution must be clear in your mind before you write one word on paper; it is context, it holds the ending in place. Billy Wilder once remarked that if you ever have a problem with your ending, the answer always lies in the beginning. To write a strong opening, you must know your ending. This applies to almost everything in life. If you want to cook a meal, or a specific dish, you don’t just go into the kitchen, open the refrigerator, and start throwing things together, then see what you’ve got! You know what you’re going to prepare before you go into the kitchen; then all you have to do is cook it.

		Your story is really a journey, the end its destination. Take another look at The Hours, or at the opening of American Beauty. After the short video scene, we see a city and a street, and we hear Lester Burnham’s voice-over: “My name is Lester Burnham. I’m forty-two years old. In less than a year I’ll be dead….In a way, I’m dead already.” The story then shows us how he comes back to life.

		It seems that one of the major difficulties screenwriters deal with is the problem of endings: how to end your screenplay so it works effectively, so it’s satisfying and fulfilling, so it makes an emotional impact on the reader and audience, so it’s not contrived or predictable, so it’s real, believable, not forced or fabricated; an ending that resolves all the main story points; an ending, in short, that works.

		More easily said than done. What’s so interesting about endings is that, in most cases, the ending itself is not really the problem; it’s the fact that it doesn’t work effectively. It’s either too soft or too slow, too wordy or too vague, too expensive or not expensive enough, too down, too up, too contrived, too predictable, or too unbelievable. Sometimes it’s simply not dramatic enough to resolve the story line, or maybe a surprise twist suddenly comes out of nowhere. Many aspiring screenwriters feel the best way to end their screenplay is by having the main character die, or in some extreme cases, having everybody die. It’s tight, complete, easy. But you can do better than that.

		Jean Renoir once told me that a good teacher is someone who “shows people the connections between things.” I always try to remember that and utilize it in my writings and teachings. In physics, it’s a natural law that endings and beginnings are related—cause and effect, like Newton’s Third Law of Motion in physics: For every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction.

		For me, the ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else. Be it a wedding, funeral, or divorce; a career change or the ending of one relationship and the beginning of a new one; a move to a new city or country; or winning or losing your life savings in Las Vegas—it’s all the same: The end of one thing is always the beginning of something else. If you overcome a serious medical challenge, like cancer or a heart attack, or go through a near-death experience, it’s a brand-new beginning with an awareness that every breath you take is a sacred gift, a blessing of joy and gratitude.

		When I was head of the story department at Cinemobile, I was always seventy scripts behind. The pile on my desk rarely got smaller. And if by some miracle I almost caught up, a stack of scripts would suddenly appear from nowhere—from agents, producers, directors, actors, studios. I read so many screenplays that were boring and poorly written that I learned to tell within the first ten pages whether a script was working or not. I gave the writer thirty pages to set up the story, and if it wasn’t done by then I reached for the next script on the pile. I had too many scripts to read to waste my time reading material that didn’t work. I was reading three scripts a day. I didn’t have time to hope the writer did his or her job; he either set up his story or he didn’t. If he didn’t, I threw the script into the large trash bin that served as the “return file.”

		With that in mind, it’s interesting to ask yourself the question: What is the opening of your screenplay? How does it begin? What is the opening scene or sequence? What do you write after “fade in”?

		You’ve only got about ten pages to grab the attention of your reader or audience; that’s why so many films open with an attentiongrabbing sequence like the opening of Jaws (Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb), The Shawshank Redemption, The Hours, Raiders of the Lost Ark (Lawrence Kasdan), the pizza delivery run in Spider-Man 2, or the dream sequence that opens Rushmore. Once you establish this scene or sequence, usually called the inciting incident, you can set up the rest of your story.

		Don’t worry about where to put the credits. The credits are usually a filmic decision, not a writing one. The placement of credits is the last thing decided on a film, and it’s the decision of the film editor and director. Whether it’s a dynamic credit montage or simply white cards superimposed on a black background, where to put the credits is not your decision. You can write “credits begin” or “credits end” if you want, but that’s it. Write the screenplay; don’t worry about the credits.

		Nobody sells a script in Hollywood without the help of a reader. I hate to be the one to tell you this, but in Hollywood, “nobody reads”; producers don’t read, directors don’t read, stars don’t read. Readers read. There is an elaborate filtering system regarding screenplays in this town. Everybody says they’re going to read your script over the weekend, and that means they’re going to give it to somebody to read within the next few weeks: a reader, secretary, receptionist, wife, girlfriend, assistant. If the reader says she likes the screenplay, then she’ll pass it on to a creative executive, who’ll take the script home over the weekend to read.

		The screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader turning pages. The first ten pages of your screenplay are absolutely the most crucial. Within the first ten pages, a reader will know whether your story is working or not, whether it’s been set up or not. You’ve got ten pages to grab the attention of your reader. What are you going to do with them? How are you going to hook the reader?

		So we go back to the beginning: What’s the opening of your screenplay? When you start thinking about how you’re going to open your script, the creative choices you make are essential in keeping the reader turning pages. What scene or sequence is on page one, word one? What are you going to show? What image, or action, are you going to visually present that will grab the attention of your reader and audience? Is it going to be a visually exciting action sequence, as in The Wild Bunch or Lord of the Rings or the battle scene in Cold Mountain? Or are you going to create an interesting character introduction, as Robert Towne does in Shampoo: a darkened bedroom, moans and squeals of pleasurable delight—the phone rings, loud, insistent, shattering the mood. It’s another woman—for Warren Beatty, who’s in bed with Lee Grant. It shows us everything we need to know about his character. In The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson use a voice-over narration to introduce the family background while showing us the four main characters growing up. It sets up the entire film and establishes the theme of family, failure, and forgiveness.

		Shakespeare is a master of openings. Either he opens with an action sequence, like the ghost walking the parapet in Hamlet, or the witches foretelling the future in Macbeth, or he uses a scene revealing something about the character: Richard III is hunchbacked and laments about the “winter of our discontent”; King Lear demands to know how much his daughters love him, in terms of material goods, in dollars and cents. Before Romeo and Juliet begins, the chorus appears, bangs for silence, and synopsizes the story of the “star-crossed lovers.”

		Shakespeare knew his audience: the groundlings standing in the pit, the poor and oppressed, drinking freely, talking boisterously to the performers if they didn’t like the action onstage. He had to grab their attention and focus it on the action.

		An opening can be visually active and exciting, grabbing the audience immediately. Another kind of opening is expository, slower-paced in establishing character and situation: Thelma & Louise, Y Tu Mamá También, American Beauty, Sideways, or Mean Girls.

		Your story determines the type of opening you choose.

		The Watergate break-in opens All the President’s Men (William Goldman) with a tense and dramatic sequence. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring sets up the history of the ring and the situation in Middle Earth; Close Encounters of the Third Kind opens with a dynamic, mysterious sequence where we don’t know what’s going on. Rushmore is a story about a dreamer, so it opens with the main character in a dream sequence that illuminates the character’s affinity for living in fantasy. The opening of Julia (Alvin Sargent) is moody, reflective, establishing a character enmeshed in the strands of memory. An Unmarried Woman (Paul Mazursky) opens with an argument, then reveals the life of the married woman.

		The opening of your screenplay has to be well thought out and visually designed to illustrate what your story is about. Many times I read screenplays and the writer has not really thought out his/her opening; there are scenes and sequences that don’t have anything to do with the story. It’s like the writer is searching, through dialogue and explanation, for his/her story. Before you write one shot, one word of dialogue on paper, you must know four things: your ending, your beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. In that order. These four elements, these four incidents, episodes, or events, are the cornerstones, the foundation, of your screenplay.

		Endings and beginnings are related in the same way that an ice cube and water are related: Water is composed of a definite molecular structure, and an ice cube has a definite crystalline structure. But when an ice cube melts in water, you can’t tell the difference between the elements that were water and those that were the ice cube. They are part and parcel of the same thing; they exist in the relationship between the parts and the whole. The opening of your script will determine whether the reader continues reading your screenplay or not. He or she must know three things within these first few pages of the script: the character—who the story is about; the dramatic (or comedic) premise—what the story is about; and the situation—the circumstances surrounding the action. Within those first ten pages, the reader is going to make a decision about whether he/she likes or dislikes the material. If you don’t believe me, check it out at the next movie you see. More about this in a later chapter.

		Robert Rossen’s The Hustler, one of the great classics of the ’60s, opens with Eddie (Paul Newman) arriving to play pool at a pool hall with Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason); it ends with Eddie leaving the pool hall after winning the game, in a self-imposed exile from the world of pool. The film opens with a pool game and closes with a pool game.

		In Sydney Pollack’s excellent Three Days of the Condor, one of the unheralded great films of the ’70s, Joseph Turner (played by Robert Redford) raises the dramatic premise of the entire film in his first line: “Anything in the pouch for me, Dr. Lapp?” The answer to that question results in several people being brutally murdered and in Turner almost losing his life. He has uncovered a “CIA” within the CIA—and he doesn’t know it until the end of the movie. His discovery is the final key that resolves the movie.

		The ending of Condor (Lorenzo Semple Jr. and David Rayfiel, from the novel Six Days of the Condor by James Grady) is an excellent example of story resolution. Ably directed by Sydney Pollack, it is a fast-moving, well-constructed thriller that works on all levels—the acting is excellent, the cinematography effective, the ending tight and lean; there is no “fat” in this film.

		By the end of the movie, Turner has tracked down the mysterious Lionel Atwood—a high-level executive in the CIA—but he doesn’t know who Atwood is or what his connection is, if any, to the murders. In the resolution scene, Turner establishes Atwood as the man who ordered the murders, determining that he is responsible for establishing a secret cell of the CIA within the CIA because of the world’s oil fields. This now established, Joubert (Max von Sydow) appears, the hired assassin of the intelligence underworld, and abruptly kills Atwood. Turner is now back in the employ of the “company,” the CIA. He breathes easier; he’s alive—“at least for now,” as Joubert reminds him.

		No loose ends. Everything is resolved dramatically, in terms of action and character; all questions raised are answered. The story is complete.

		The filmmakers added a “tag” scene at the end. Joe Turner and Higgins are standing in front of the New York Times Building, and Turner states that if anything happens to him, the Times has the story. But “will they print it?” Higgins asks.

		It’s a good question.

		If we think about the relationship between the ending and beginning, the parts and the whole, we can look at the story’s resolution as a whole made up of the ending, the parts. The resolution is the seed of the ending, and if planted and nurtured correctly, it can sprout into a full-fledged dramatic experience. That’s what we all strive for. Endings are manifested in the resolution and the resolution is conceived in the beginning.

		If you don’t know your ending, then ask yourself what you would like the ending to be, regardless of whether it’s too simple, too trite, too happy, or too sad. And please, please, don’t get caught up in the game of “What kind of an ending would they like?”—whoever they are. What ending do you want? It doesn’t matter whether it’s “commercial” or not, because nobody knows what’s commercial or not anyway.

		You might find it necessary to write an essay about what happens in Act III so that the story line is clear and defined. Then go through the action and in free association, in a one- or two-page essay, begin to list the ways this film can end. Don’t be attached to any single shot, scene, or sequence. Just list the various ways the endings can be achieved. If that doesn’t clarify the action, and you’re still unclear about how the material should end, simply write down how you would like it to end, regardless of budget, believability, or anything else that gets in the way. Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas, without any regard as to how to do it. That’s really the first step in the completion process. It’s important to tie together all the loose ends of the narrative line so the screenplay becomes a complete reading and visual experience (in the mind’s eye) that rings true and is integral to the action and the characters.

		There are other ways to end your screenplay as well. There may be an instance where Act III becomes an entire sequence, a full and complete unit of action. The ending of Apollo 13 is such a case; as are the endings of Witness and Crimson Tide. And if you look at Pulp Fiction, the ending is really a “bookend”: the Pumpkin and Honey Bunny (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) robbery attempt in the restaurant—which, coincidentally, opens the movie. Endings and beginnings are connected, right? In each of these scripts the ending completes the action of Act III.

		In Apollo 13, the entire third act focuses on the astronauts’ return to Earth, as we follow the action from the moment the LEM separates from the spacecraft, cutting back and forth to the command center, to the anxious three minutes that turns out to be four, waiting for them to plunge through the atmosphere, not knowing whether the heat shield will protect them or not. When they finally do break through the cloud cover and land safely in the ocean and are rescued, that is the resolution; the ending is simply the voice-over of Jim Lovell telling us what happened to the three astronauts after their ordeal in space. It’s played over shots of them on the aircraft carrier.

		The Plot Point at the end of Act II in Witness has John Book (Harrison Ford) and Rachel completing their relationship as they embrace underneath the birdhouse that Book had broken when he first arrived, and that has now been restored. Act III opens when the three crooked cops pull over the ridge, park their car, pull out their weapons, and make their way down to the farmhouse. Once there, they break into the farmhouse and hold Rachel and the grandfather hostage while they hunt for Book and young Samuel, trying to kill them. So the entire third act is really a shoot-out, and the end emerges from that action; John Book says good-bye to Rachel and young Samuel, and over the end credits, as he drives the car up the long dirt road leading back to Philadelphia, Daniel, Rachel’s suitor (Alexander Godunov), walks toward the farmhouse. Witness is a great little film that works on all levels. The ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else.

		It’s a little different with Crimson Tide (Michael Schiffer). At Plot Point II, the emergency action message has been partially received, and while it is being deciphered, the Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman characters are at an uneasy standoff as the countdown to launch the nuclear missiles continues. Act III is an entire sequence, and ends when they finally receive the complete message telling them to cancel the nuclear strike. That’s the resolution.

		The ending is something else. There is a little tag added on after the action is complete: A naval inquiry is held, and it is decided that both men were right in their actions, because the naval regulations were unclear on this situation. The Gene Hackman character retires from active duty, and the Denzel Washington character will be promoted to captain and receive command of his own ship.

		Two different points of view, resolved, effective, complete. It’s what a good ending is meant to provide.

		So what makes a good ending? It has to work, first of all, by satisfying the story; when we reach the final fade-out and walk away from the movie experience, we want to feel full and satisfied, much as if we were leaving the table after a good meal. It’s this feeling of satisfaction that must be fulfilled in order for an ending to work effectively. And, of course, it’s got to be believable.

		What you want in your screenplay is the best possible ending that works. You want to be true to your story line and not have to resort to any tricks, gimmicks, or contrived elements in order to make it work. Sometimes you start out writing with a specific ending in mind and you base the structure and story line around it, but as you’re writing the story, you suddenly get a better idea about how to end the script. Go with it. Let it change. It probably is a better ending. That’s where you have to trust your creative self, your intuition. But, though it’s good to accept that your ending may change as you’re writing, that doesn’t mean you should begin writing without knowing your ending.

		If I could sum up the concept of endings and state the one most important thing to remember, I would say: The ending comes out of the beginning. Someone, or something, initiates an action, and how that action is resolved becomes the story line of the film.

		The Chinese say that “the longest journey begins with the first step,” and in many philosophical systems “endings and beginnings” are connected; as in the concept of yin and yang, two concentric circles joined together, forever united, forever opposed.

		If you can find a way to illustrate this in your screenplay, it is to your advantage.

		This is something you can study. Read as many scripts as you can. There are several Web sites that offer downloadable screenplays. Just Google “screenplays” and check out the sites. And you should be seeing and analyzing as many films as you can, at least two movies a week, either in movie theaters or on DVD or video. Movies are available to everyone now. You should see all kinds of movies: good films, bad films, foreign films, old films, new films. Every film you see becomes a learning experience; if you examine it, it will generate a process, giving you an expanded awareness of the screenplay. A movie should be viewed as a working session: Talk about it, discuss it with friends or loved ones; see whether you can isolate its structure; see whether it fits the paradigm or not.

		So, what’s the best way to open your screenplay?

		KNOW YOUR ENDING!

		Cat Stevens sums it up in his song “Sitting”:

		Life is like a maze of doors,

		and they open from the side you’re on.

		Just keep on pushin’ hard, boy, try as you may,

		you might wind up where you started from.

		Endings and beginnings: two sides of the same coin.

		—

		Determine the ending of your screenplay, then design your opening. The primary rule for the opening is: Does it set your story in motion? Does it establish your main character? Does it state the dramatic premise? Does it set up the situation? Does it establish or set up a problem that your character must confront and overcome? Does it state your character’s need?

		Setting Up the Story


		 			“I’ll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son of a bitch. You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class?”

			—Chinatown (omitted lines)

			Robert Towne





There’s a law in physics called Newton’s Third Law of Motion, which states that “for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” Which means, basically, that everything is related. We exist in relationship to each other, we exist in relationship to the Earth, we exist in relationship to all living things, and we exist in relationship to the universe. “There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow…” is the way Shakespeare puts it.

		In a screenplay the same principle holds true: Everything is related. If we go back to the second definition of structure, it states that there is a causal “relationship between the parts and the whole.” If you change a scene or a line of dialogue on page 10, it impacts and influences a scene or a line of dialogue on page 80. Change a few elements in the ending, and you have to add or delete a few elements in the beginning. A screenplay is a whole, and exists in direct relationship to its parts. Therefore, it becomes essential to introduce your story from the very beginning, from page one, word one. As mentioned, you’ve got about ten pages or less to grab your reader, so you’ve got to set up your story right away.

		The reader must know what’s going on immediately, from the very first words on the page. Setting up your story by explaining things through dialogue slows down the action and impedes the story progression. A screenplay is a story told with pictures, remember, so it’s important to set up your story visually. The reader must know who the main character is, what the dramatic premise is, what the story is about, and the dramatic situation—the circumstances surrounding the action.

		These elements must be introduced within the first ten pages, whether you open your screenplay with an action sequence, as in Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, or Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, or with a dramatic sequence, as in The Shawshank Redemption, The Pianist, or Mystic River (Brian Helgeland). The reader has to know what the story is about and who it’s about. I tell my students you have to approach the first ten pages of your screenplay as a unit, or block, of dramatic action. It must be designed and executed with efficiency and dramatic value because it sets up everything that follows.

		I thought about this as I was preparing this chapter. When I first wrote Screenplay, I used Chinatown as an illustration of the best way to set up your screenplay, interrelating story with character and situation. I examined other films as well, but I kept coming back to Chinatown. The first ten pages of this film still work perfectly as an example of setting up your story.

		Chinatown is now considered one of the classic American screenplays; conceived in the 1970s, it was written and produced during a virtual renaissance of American screenwriting. Not that it’s any “better” set up than The Godfather, or Apocalypse Now, or All the President’s Men, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or Five Easy Pieces (Carol Eastman, aka Adrien Joyce), or Annie Hall, or Julia, or Coming Home, or later films such as Raging Bull (Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin), or An Officer and a Gentleman (Douglas Day Stewart), or Dances With Wolves, or Thelma & Louise, or Forrest Gump (Eric Roth), or Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino), or The Usual Suspects (Chris McQuarrie), and so many others. All of these films are outstanding examples of how screenplays are set up. But after looking at them all, as well as many others, I decided Chinatown was still the most effective.

		Why? Because Chinatown is a film that works on all levels: story, characters, historical perspective, visual dynamics, and above all, the basic essentials that illustrate screenwriting as a craft. The film is a mystery-thriller in the style and tradition of Raymond Chandler; Robert Towne used the Owens Valley Scandal of the early 1900s as the dramatic backdrop to the story, but updated the action from the turn of the century to Los Angeles in 1937. In this way, Towne achieved the same revolutionary shift in filmmaking as did the Flemish painters of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, who placed the portraits of their Belgium patrons against the backdrop of Italian landscapes, a move that changed the course of art history.

		I’ve written a lot about my experience of Chinatown, and I still vividly recall the first time I saw it, at an industry screening at Paramount. I was working at Cinemobile at the time, and there was a light rain falling as I pulled into the Paramount lot. As I walked through the dampness of early evening, I did not want to be there. It had been an extremely full and stressful day. I had read my usual quota of scripts, attended my usual quota of meetings, and had a large and late lunch with a writer during which I drank a little too much wine. My throat was raw, and I felt I was coming down with a cold. Nothing would be better, I thought, than soaking in a long hot bath, having a nice cup of tea, and crawling into bed.

		The film began, and as the story unfolded, my critical mind kicked in and I started a little dialogue in which I was complaining about the movie. I thought it was flat, the characters dull and one-dimensional. Before I knew it, I had nodded off. I don’t know how much of the film I missed, I just knew it was one of those evenings where my body was in the screening room, but I certainly was not.

		When I heard the last lines of the film, “Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown,” that’s exactly what I wanted to do. By the time I got home, I had already forgotten about it.

		So much for my introduction to Chinatown.

		A short time later, I had the opportunity to interview Robert Towne, and during the course of our conversation I asked how he went about creating his characters, especially how he conceived Jake Gittes, the Jack Nicholson character. He replied that the first question he often asks himself when approaching his character is “What is this character afraid of?” In other words, what is his/her deepest fear? Gittes, a private detective who specializes in “discreet investigation,” has a certain reputation to uphold, so he always wants to “look good.” He does everything to make a good impression. He dresses immaculately, has his shoes shined every day, and has his own code of ethics. Gittes’s unspoken, deep-seated fear is not being taken seriously, looking foolish.

		I was very impressed with Bob Towne, both by what he said and how he said it. He was open, insightful, articulate, engaging, and extremely literate, qualities I genuinely admire. I was so impressed that I wanted to see Chinatown again; I wanted to see if I’d be able to catch those little nuances of character and story that Towne had spoken about that I had missed during my first viewing of the film.

		So, one night after work, I went to see it again. And this time, by the end of the film, when Evelyn Mulwray, the innocent victim, is killed in Chinatown, I felt I had really seen the movie. When I heard that familiar last line, “Forget it, Jake It’s Chinatown,” I was touched, moved, and inspired. The film lingered with me over the next few days, and various scenes kept coming back to mind.

		My experience of Chinatown was literally a voyage of discovery. Against the backdrop of water runoff and several murders, we follow Jake Gittes as he uncovers the puzzle, one piece at a time. We learn what’s going on at the same time that Gittes does; audience and character are linked together as they connect the bits and pieces of seemingly unrelated information, as they assemble this giant jigsaw puzzle.

		From the very first images on screen—a series of photographs showing a man and woman having sex in the park—we know this is a story told in pictures. Over these pictures, we hear the moans and groans of Curly, the husband of the woman, played by Burt Young. What does this show? What Jake Gittes, the main character, does for a living. He’s a private detective specializing in divorces, unfaithful spouses, and “going through other people’s dirty linen,” as one of the characters remarks. It’s his métier.

		Jake’s character is defined by what he does, his actions. Towne sets up the story in the very first scene. When the phony Mrs. Mulwray (Diane Ladd) hires Jake to find out who her husband is having an affair with, he begins his surveillance of Hollis Mulwray. As he does, the audience learns what Gittes learns.

		After Gittes follows Mulwray to the dried-out Los Angeles River bed, then to the ocean, his long surveillance is rewarded when he witnesses water being dumped into the ocean. Several hours later, when Gittes returns to his car, he picks a leaflet off the windshield declaring, “Our city is dying of thirst!” and “Save our city.”

		This theme of water is an organic, thematic thread, woven through the story. As I began tracing the connection of water to the story, I felt like Gittes when Noah Cross (John Huston) tells him, “You may think you know what’s going on, but believe me, you don’t.”

		When Gittes finds “the girl” at the end of Act I and closes the case, he sees the pictures he had taken on the front page of the newspaper. (And if you look closely in the background of this scene, you’ll see a car overheating from lack of water.) The headlines scream “scandal,” and when Jake returns to his office, he finds a woman waiting for him: Faye Dunaway. She confirms they’ve never met, then declares she could never have hired him to find out who her husband is having an affair with. “You see, my name is Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray”: the real Mrs. Mulwray.

		This is the key incident in the movie. It is the “key” that unlocks the story. If Faye Dunaway is the real Mrs. Mulwray, who is the Diane Ladd character who hired Gittes, claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray? And who hired the phony Mrs. Mulwray? And why? That’s the question that shocks Gittes into action. It is the true beginning of the story.

		The relationship between these scenes of seemingly unrelated information sets up the entire story. Every scene, every piece of information, no matter how seemingly small, reveals something about the story and leads to that moment when the real Evelyn Mulwray shows up. This entire unit of dramatic action serves to establish three things: who the main character is, what the story is about, and what the dramatic situation is, the circumstances surrounding the action; i.e., “L.A. is dying of thirst.”

		The first ten pages set up the entire screenplay. What follows are these first ten pages of Chinatown as they appear in the screenplay. Read them carefully. Notice how Towne sets up his main character, how he introduces the dramatic premise and reveals the dramatic situation.

		(NOTE: All questions about screenplay form will be discussed in Chapter 10.)

			CHINATOWN

			by Robert Towne

			FADE IN

			FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH

			grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING another, more compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.

			CURLY’S VOICE

			(crying out)

			Oh, no.

			INT. GITTES’ OFFICE

			CURLY drops the photos on Gittes’ desk. Curly towers over GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman’s clothes, his breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes’ shiny desktop.

			Gittes notes it. A fan whirrs overhead. Gittes glances up at it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a cigarette using a lighter with a “nail” on his desk.

			Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew.

			Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually bites into the blinds.

			Gittes doesn’t move from his chair.

			GITTES

			All right, enough is enough—you can’t eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. I just had ’em installed on Wednesday.

			Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys.

			Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly.

			(2)

			GITTES

			Down the hatch.

			Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry quietly.

			CURLY

			(drinking, relaxing a little)

			She’s just no good.

			GITTES

			What can I tell you, kid? You’re right. When you’re right, you’re right, and you’re right.

			CURLY

			Ain’t worth thinking about.

			Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.

			GITTES

			You’re absolutely right, I wouldn’t give her another thought.

			CURLY

			(pouring himself)

			You know, you’re okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it’s your job, but you’re okay.

			GITTES

			(settling back, breathing a little easier)

			Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.

			CURLY

			Thanks. You know something, Jake?

			GITTES

			What’s that, Curly?

			CURLY

			I think I’ll kill her.

			(3)

			INT. DUFFY & WALSH’S OFFICE

			noticeably less plush than Gittes’. A well-groomed, dark-haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling with the veil on her pillbox hat.

			WOMAN

			I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to this personally—

			WALSH

			(almost the manner of someone comforting the bereaved)

			If you’ll allow us to complete our preliminary questioning, by then he’ll be free.

			There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes’ office—something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.

			INT. GITTES’ OFFICE—GITTES & CURLY

			Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of perspiration on his desk.

			CURLY

			(crying)

			They don’t kill a guy for that.

			GITTES

			Oh they don’t?

			CURLY

			Not for your wife. That’s the unwritten law.

			Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting:

			GITTES (Con’t)

			I’ll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class?

			(4)

			Curly shrinks back a little.

			CURLY

			…No…

			GITTES

			You bet your ass you don’t. You can’t even pay me off.

			This seems to upset Curly even more.

			CURLY

			I’ll pay the rest next trip—we only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don’t pay you for skipjack the way they do tuna or albacore–

			GITTES

			(easing him out of his office)

			Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point…

			INT. OFFICE RECEPTION

			He’s now walking him past SOPHIE, who pointedly averts her gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be read: J.J. GITTES and Associates—DISCREET INVESTIGATION.

			GITTES

			I don’t want your last dime.

			He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile.

			GITTES

			(continuing)

			What kind of a guy do you think I am?

			CURLY

			Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

			GITTES

			Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.

			He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears.

			(5)

			He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath.

			SOPHIE

			A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you, with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

			Gittes nods, walks on in.

			INT. DUFFY & WALSH’S OFFICE

			Walsh rises when Gittes enters.

			WALSH

			Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr.

			Gittes?

			Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile.

			GITTES

			How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

			MRS. MULWRAY

			Mr. Gittes…

			GITTES

			Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?

			She holds her breath. The revelation isn’t easy for her.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.

			Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to his two partners.

			GITTES

			(gravely)

			No, really?

			MRS. MULWRAY

			I’m afraid so.

			GITTES

			I am sorry.

			Gittes pulls up a chair, sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray—between Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.

			(6)

			Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			Can’t we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?

			GITTES

			I’m afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they’re going to assist me. I can’t do everything myself.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			Of course not.

			GITTES

			Now—what makes you certain he is involved with someone?

			Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the question.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			A wife can tell.

			Gittes sighs.

			GITTES

			Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?

			MRS. MULWRAY

(shocked)

			…Yes, of course.

			GITTES

			(deliberately)

			Then go home and forget about it.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			But…

			GITTES

			(staring intently at her)

			I am sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, “let sleeping dogs lie”? You’re better off not knowing.

			(7)

			MRS. MULWRAY

(with some real anxiety)

			But I have to know!

			Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.

			GITTES

			All right, what’s your husband’s first name?

			MRS. MULWRAY

			Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

			GITTES

			(visibly surprised)

			Water and Power?

			Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray’s dress—her handbag, shoes, etc.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			He’s the Chief Engineer.

			DUFFY

			(a little eagerly)

Chief Engineer?

			Gittes’ glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the questioning. Mrs. Mulwray nods.

			GITTES

			(confidentially)

			This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.

			MRS. MULWRAY

			Money doesn’t matter to me, Mr.

			Gittes.

			Gittes sighs.

			GITTES

			Very well. We’ll see what we can do.

			EXT. CITY HALL—MORNING

			already shimmering with heat.

			A drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at the foot of the steps.

			Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up the stairs.

			INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS

			Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering:

			“PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR”

			Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking.

			BAGBY

			Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it—but you can’t drink it, you can’t water your lawns with it, you can’t irrigate an orange grove with it. Remember—we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert. Los Angeles is a desert community. Beneath this building, beneath every street, there’s a desert. Without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we’d never existed!

			(pausing, letting the implication sink in)

			CLOSE—GITTES

			BAGBY (O.S.)

			(continuing)

			The Alto Vallejo can save us from that, and I respectfully suggest that eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets—and not on top of them.

			(9)

			AUDIENCE—COUNCIL CHAMBERS

			An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers applaud. Somebody shooshes them.

			Mayor Bagby…let’s hear from the departments again—I suppose we better take Water and Power first. Mr.

			Mulwray.

			REACTION—GITTES

			looking up with interest from his racing form.

			MULWRAY

			walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in his sixties who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The man turns the overleaf on the map.

			MULWRAY

			In case you’ve forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way—core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster. It couldn’t withstand that kind of pressure there.

			(referring to a new overleaf)

			Now you propose yet another dirt-banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve-thousand-acre water surface. Well, it won’t hold. I won’t build it. It’s that simple—I am not making that kind of mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.

			(10)

			Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a red-faced FARMER drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.

			COUNCIL PRESIDENT

			(shouting to farmer)

			What in the hell do you think you’re doing?

			(as the sheep bleat down the aisle toward the Council)

			Get those goddam things out of here!

			FARMER

			(right back)

			Tell me where to take them! You don’t have an answer for that so quick, do you?

			Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the COUNCIL and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he’s going to bodily attack Mulwray.

			FARMER

			(through above, to Mulwray)

			You steal the water from the Valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock—who’s paying you to do that, Mr.

			Mulwray, that’s what I want to know!

			The scene ends and we cut to Los Angeles River bed where Gittes watches Mulwray through binoculars.

		—

		Let’s take a look at these first ten pages, which set up the story.

		The main character, Jake Gittes, is introduced in his office, showing photographs of Curly’s wife being unfaithful.

		We learn things about Gittes. On page 1, for example, we find that he “looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat.” He is shown to be a meticulous man who uses his “handkerchief to wipe away the plunk of perspiration on his desk.” When he walks up the steps of City Hall a few pages later, he is “impeccably dressed.” These visual descriptions convey character traits that reflect his personality. Notice how Gittes is not physically described at all; he’s not tall, thin, fat, short, or anything else. He seems like a nice guy. “I wouldn’t take your last dime,” he says. “What kind of a guy do you think I am?” Yet he offers Curly a drink from a “cheaper bottle of bourbon from the several fifths of more expensive whiskeys.” He’s vulgar, yet exudes a certain amount of charm and sophistication. He’s the kind of man who wears monogrammed shirts and carries silk handkerchiefs, who has his shoes shined and hair cut at least once a week.

		On page 4, Towne reveals the dramatic situation visually in the stage directions: “on the pebbled glass can be read J.J. GITTES and Associates—DISCREET INVESTIGATION.” Gittes is a private detective who specializes in divorce work, or “other people’s dirty linen,” as the cop Loach says about him. Later, we’ll learn he’s an ex-cop who left the force; when Escobar tells him he made lieutenant, Gittes suffers a twinge of envy.

		The dramatic premise is established on page 5 when the phony Mrs. Mulwray informs Jake Gittes, “My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.” That statement sets up everything that follows: Gittes, the ex-cop, “checks out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray’s dress—her handbag, shoes, etc.” That’s his job, and he’s very good at what he does.

		When Gittes tracks down and takes pictures of “the little twist” Mulwray is supposedly having an affair with, as far as he is concerned, the case is closed. The next day he’s surprised to find the pictures he took on the front page of the newspaper, with headlines declaring that the head of the Department of Water and Power has been “caught” in a love nest. He doesn’t know how his pictures got into the paper. When he returns to his office he is further surprised to find the real Mrs. Mulwray there to greet him—the key incident and the Plot Point at the end of Act I.

		“Do you know me?” she asks.

		“No,” Gittes replies. “I would have remembered.”

		“Since you agree we’ve never met, you must also agree that I haven’t hired you to do anything—certainly not spy on my husband,” she says. As she leaves, her attorney hands Gittes a complaint that could take his license away and smear his name and reputation.

		Gittes doesn’t know what’s going on. If this woman is the real Mrs. Mulwray, who was the woman who hired him, and why? More important, who hired the woman to hire him? Someone has gone to a lot of trouble to set him up. “I’m not the one who’s supposed to be caught with my pants down,” he says. He’s going to find out who’s responsible, and why. That is Jake Gittes’s dramatic need, and it drives him through the story until he solves the mystery.

		The dramatic premise—“My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman”—sets up the direction of the screenplay. And direction, remember, is “a line of development.”

		In the interview I did with Robert Towne, he said he approached Chinatown from the point of view that “some crimes are punished because they can be punished. If you kill somebody, rob or rape somebody, you’ll be caught and thrown into jail. But crimes against an entire community you really can’t punish, so you end up rewarding them. You know, those people who get their names on streets and plaques at City Hall. And that’s the basic point of view of the story.”

		“You know something, Jake?” Curly tells Gittes on page 2. “I think I’ll kill her,” meaning his wife.

		Gittes responds with the prophetic lines that illustrate the script’s point of view. “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class?”

		Curly certainly can’t get away with murder, but Noah Cross, Evelyn Mulwray’s father and former head of the Department of Water and Power along with Hollis Mulwray, can and does get away with it. The ending of the film shows Noah Cross whisking his daughter/granddaughter into the night after Evelyn Mulwray is killed trying to escape. That is Towne’s point of view: “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it.”

		That brings us to the “crime” of Chinatown, a scheme based on the water scandal known as the Rape of the Owens Valley. It is the backdrop of Chinatown.

		In 1900, the city of Los Angeles, “a desert community,” as former mayor Bagby reminds us, was growing and expanding so fast it was literally running out of water. If the city was to survive, it had to find another source of water. L.A. is right next door to the Pacific Ocean. “You can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail on it, but you can’t drink it, you can’t water your lawns with it, and you can’t irrigate an orange grove with it,” Bagby argues.

		The closest water to L.A. is the Owens River, located in the Owens Valley, a green and fertile area about 250 miles northeast of Los Angeles. A group of businessmen, community leaders, and politicians—some would call them “men of vision”—saw the need for water and conceived a marvelous scheme. They would buy up the river rights to the Owens River, by force if necessary, then buy up all that worthless land in the San Fernando Valley, about 20 miles outside L.A. Then they would place a bond issue on the ballot that would fund building an aqueduct from the Owens Valley across 250 miles of blazing desert and jagged foothills to the San Fernando Valley. Then they would turn around and sell the now “fertile” land of the San Fernando Valley to the city of Los Angeles for an enormous sum of money, about $300 million.

		That was the plan. The government knew about it, the newspapers knew about it, the local politicians knew about it. When the time was right, the authorities would “influence” the people of Los Angeles to pass the proposed bond issue.

		In 1906, Los Angeles was in the middle of a drought. Things got bad, then worse. People were forbidden to wash their cars or water their lawns; they couldn’t flush their toilets more than a few times a day. The city dried up; flowers died, lawns turned brown, and scare headlines declared, “Los Angeles is dying of thirst!” and “Save our city!”

		To underscore the drastic need for water during the drought and to make certain the citizens passed the bond issue, the Department of Water and Power dumped thousands of gallons of water into the ocean.

		When it came time to vote, the bond issue passed easily. The Owens Valley aqueduct took several years to complete. When it was finished, William Mulholland, then head of the Department of Water and Power, turned the water over to the city: “There it is,” he said. “Take it.”

		Los Angeles flourished and grew like wildfire; the Owens Valley withered and died. No wonder it was called the Rape of the Owens Valley.

		Robert Towne took this scandal from 1906 and used it as the backdrop in Chinatown. He changed the time period from the turn of the century to 1937, when the visual elements of Los Angeles had the classic and distinctive look of Southern California.

		The water scandal that Noah Cross (how appropriate his name) conceives and executes, the crime that causes the deaths of Hollis Mulwray, Leroy the drunk, Ida Sessions, and finally Evelyn Mulwray, the scandal that Jake Gittes uncovers, is woven with great subtlety and skill through the entire screenplay.

		And Noah Cross gets away with murder.

		All this is established and set up on page 8, when Gittes is in the council chambers and we hear Bagby arguing that “eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the deserts from our streets—and not on top of them.”

		Hollis Mulwray, the character modeled on William Mulholland, replies that the dam site is unsafe, as proven by the previous Van der Lip Dam disaster, and says, “I won’t build it. It’s that simple—I am not making that kind of mistake twice.” By refusing to build the dam, Hollis Mulwray becomes a target for murder; he is an obstacle that must be eliminated.

		Again, on page 10, the dramatic question of the screenplay is raised: “You steal the water from the Valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock,” yells the farmer who invades the chambers. “Who’s paying you to do that, Mr. Mulwray, that’s what I want to know!”

		So does Gittes.

		It is the question that propels the story to its final resolution, and it is all set up from the very beginning, in the first ten pages, and moves forward in a linear direction to the end.

		“Either you bring the water to L.A., or you bring L.A. to the water,” Noah Cross tells Gittes.

		That is the foundation of the entire story. That’s what makes it so great.

		It’s that simple.

		Two Incidents


		 			“Incident: A specific occurrence or event that occurs in connection to something else.”

			—The New World Dictionary





A few years ago I was given the opportunity of working with the writer Joe Eszterhas in a complicated legal case. Called as an expert witness, I was engaged to go through the entire work of this noted screenwriter, analyze the material, and then, in outline form, lay out “the structural essence” of his screenplays. In other words, what was it that made Joe Eszterhas’s material so singular and unique; what made Joe Eszterhas “Joe Eszterhas”?

		It was a daunting and intriguing assignment. I didn’t know what to do or how to begin, except to begin at the beginning, by reading his screenplays and noting the similarities and distinctions in the creation of Eszterhas’s style.

		As I began reading and analyzing his work, I became aware of several factors that seemed to make his scripts so powerful, whether they were action-thrillers like Basic Instinct, Jagged Edge, Jade, and Sliver, or dramatic and contemporary pieces like Music Box, Flashdance, and even the ill-wrought Showgirls.

		In all his work I saw he was dealing with real people in real situations, and his characters were interesting, tough, with a sense of bravado that covered a deep well of insecurity and sometimes a lack of self-respect. For instance, the Jennifer Beals character in Flashdance had a sense of creative and defiant confidence within her that engaged reader and audience. And there was the music, of course, woven into the story of the girl who overcame all odds—physical, mental, and emotional—to achieve her dream. A steelworker by day and a pole dancer by night, she had a visual appeal to a vast moviegoing audience. The film was an enormous hit.

		As I began to get more familiar with Joe Eszterhas’s scripts, I noticed that he thrust the reader and audience into the story line immediately. In most cases, he began his stories with an action sequence that plunged the main character directly into the story line.

		In Basic Instinct, the first words of the script—“It is dark; we don’t see clearly”—set the tone. The visual directions continue. “A man and woman make love on a brass bed. There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine. A tape deck PLAYS the Stones: ‘Sympathy for the Devil.’ ”

		It is a graphic, wild, and erotic sex scene, the tempo tight and passion high; as it builds in rhythm, the words get shorter and shorter. “He is inside her…arms tied above him…on his back…eyes closed…she moves…grinding…he strains for her…his head arches back…his throat white…she arches her back…her hips grind…her breasts are high…” and then, at the height of the sexual frenzy, “Her back arches back…back…her head tilts back…she extends her arms…her right arm comes down suddenly…the steel flashes…his throat is white…he bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses…” and the ice pick flashes up and down, “and up…and down…and up…and….”

		When I first read this opening scene I was totally riveted, focused, eager to continue reading and see what happened. The more I read, the more I was hooked. I had been attracted, engaged, and totally captured by the visual action of the first page.

		It’s a perfect example of what I call a visual “grabber,” an opening that grabs you by the throat and seizes your attention. What better elements can you open a screenplay with than intense passion, wild sex, horrific murder, and visual mayhem, set to the music of The Stones, to boldly establish the style and tone of an entire screenplay? It’s just a great opening.

		The next morning, the main character, Nick Curran (Michael Douglas), a tough, hard-nosed, cynical cop with too many years on the force for his relatively youthful age, investigates the crime scene along with his partner and learns that the likely suspect, Catherine (Sharon Stone), is a smart, beautiful, and accomplished novelist. And while he questions her, Nick is immediately attracted as she daringly flaunts her sexuality at him. It’s easy to see why he’s smitten and intrigued by her, and we know the temptation she offers is going to hook him. It doesn’t take too long before he becomes so infatuated with her that he can’t listen to his voice of reason, or his associates’ warnings, as he plunges headlong into a tumultuous affair that costs him his job and may wind up costing him his life.

		I began to understand that this opening sex/murder scene is the incident that sets the story in motion and directly draws the main character into the story line. The murder is committed to grab our attention and show us the reason Nick is called upon to investigate the crime. When he leaves the scene of the crime, we follow him and his partner and begin to learn more about this man and the choices he makes. The opening scene and the story that’s going to unfold are directly linked.

		This incident—the murder—and the story of a cop giving in to his temptations epitomize the illumination of character and incident. Remember Henry James: “What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?” You can’t reveal a character dramatically (or comedically) unless you have him/her react to a particular incident; the nature of drama, after all, is to show the universal connection between all humans, regardless of race, color, gender, or cultural differences.

		The incident of the murder leads directly to the infatuation Nick feels for Catherine. And that attraction is reinforced when the police question Catherine as the prime suspect. There is a relationship between these two incidents. One incident, the opening sex/murder, is called the inciting incident, because it sets the story in motion; it is the first visual representation of the key incident, what the story is about, and draws the main character into the story line. Remember the definition of incident: “a specific event or occurrence that occurs in relation to something else.”

		When I understood this connection, it was almost a revelation. Using an opening sequence to draw the main character into the story line is pure cinema. From here on through the rest of the screenplay, the story is set up, the characters and premise are established, and there is a story line, a direction to follow—and all because of the connection between these two incidents. This new understanding gave me another tool to use in the craft of screenwriting.

		I went back through all of Eszterhas’s scripts and began to examine his screenplays, focusing on how he wrote and structured opening scenes or sequences. And I saw, in most cases, that the opening scene, the inciting incident, was a cinematic tool he used to set up the story from page one, word one.

		I began to see that in certain kinds of movies—action films, action-thrillers, mysteries, action-adventures, sci-fis, even dramas—writers structure their stories so that this opening, the inciting incident, serves two distinct functions. First, it grabs or hooks the audience immediately—just look at the opening scenes or sequences of The Matrix, Jaws, Cold Mountain, The Bridges of Madison County, American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and other films, and you’ll see that this opening scene or sequence is what sets the entire story in motion.

		For example, in The Matrix, a squad of policemen confronts Trinity, and as we watch her defy all known laws of physics and gravity, leaping over buildings to escape, we are drawn into a world of cyberspace that grabs our attention immediately. The inciting incident anchors us to the edge of our seats, and lets us know that we’re in for an incredible adventure. In Jaws, the late-night beach party and a nude swimming lark turn into a horrifying experience as the great white attacks.

		In Cold Mountain, Union troops burrow underground and plant explosives beneath the Confederate camp; when the charge is detonated the result illustrates the total madness of war, just as in the classic The Bridge on the River Kwai (Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman). In The Bridges of Madison County (Richard LaGravenese), after the death of Francesca (Meryl Streep), her two grown children are going through her things and uncover a hidden diary. As they read, they discover that their mother had a love affair with a man named Robert (Clint Eastwood) many years earlier. The story of that affair becomes the entire movie. Discovering the diary, which sets the story in motion, is the inciting incident. In American Beauty, we see the “dead” life of Lester Burnham as he begins another day of remorse, regret, and failed dreams. In Pulp Fiction, we see Honey Bunny and Pumpkin discuss holding up the restaurant; when they pull out their guns we freeze the action and cut away to Jules and Vincent, driving to their assignment, recovering a briefcase for Marcellus Wallace. In Lord of the Rings, we open with the history of the ring, then watch as Bilbo Baggins finds it at the bottom of the river. This is the inciting incident that sets the entire trilogy in motion.

		I could cite example after example of the inciting incident, but what I feel is most important is the understanding that this incident serves two important and necessary functions in the craft of storytelling: (1), it sets the story in motion; and (2), it grabs the attention of the reader and audience. Seeing the relationship between this first incident and the story line is essential to an understanding of good screenwriting.

		The next time you go to a movie, or watch one on DVD or on television, see if you can identify the inciting incident and notice how it sets things in motion. Crimson Tide is one of my favorite examples. In the opening sequence, a CNN news reporter is stationed on the deck of a French aircraft carrier and shows us actual newsreel footage of Russian rebels forcefully occupying the Kremlin in an attempt to take over the government. We then cut to a shot of the rebel leader stating emphatically that the rebel forces will not tolerate any U.S. intervention and, having occupied a Russian nuclear base, feel no hesitation in launching a nuclear missile attack against the United States. Then we cut to a TV screen, with Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) and Weps (Viggo Mortensen) watching the news story during a birthday party for Ron’s three-year-old daughter.

		Why is this the inciting incident? Because it sets the story in motion. (It’s also a good illustration of the Henry James quote.) Crimson Tide is constructed around the way two people see the world. In response to the Russian rebel threat, a U.S. submarine, the Alabama, carrying live nuclear warheads, is sent out as a precautionary measure—either launch a “first-strike” missile or retaliate against Russian missiles. The Captain (Gene Hackman) believes that “war is an extension of politics,” and it is his duty to carry out his orders even if it means a nuclear holocaust. Ron, the executive officer, on the other hand, believes that because of nuclear weapons, war is an outmoded concept. The purpose of war, he says, is to win, and if both sides launch nuclear weapons, there will be no winner, only losers. War, he believes, is no longer a viable option.

		That’s when the Alabama receives orders to launch a first-strike nuclear attack against the Russians rebels. As they are preparing to launch the weapons, the men on the submarine receive another emergency message that is cut off before the entire text can be transmitted. What do these second orders say? Should they continue to follow the first orders and launch a first strike? Or will they delay the launch to confirm or deny the first order?

		These two differing points of view, these two belief systems, generate the conflict that drives the script forward. Both points of view are right within the framework of character. There is no right and wrong here, no good or bad. Hegel, the great eighteenth-century German philosopher, maintained that the essence of tragedy derives not from one character being right and the other being wrong, or from the conflict of good versus evil, but from a conflict in which both characters are right, and thus the tragedy is one of “right against right,” being carried to its logical conclusion.

		Both characters in Crimson Tide operate from that sense of truth within themselves. The Captain maintains that the situation demands that he follow the first orders received. The executive officer does not agree, and claims that the second order, even though not completely received, overrides the first and must be confirmed before they launch their first-strike missiles. Nobody is right or wrong in this conflict, because both men’s actions are determined by their point of view, the way they see the world.

		As I repeat often, all drama is conflict: Without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story; and without story you have no screenplay.

		The Russian rebels have threatened to launch a nuclear missile attack on the U.S., and this conflict becomes the foundation of the entire film. And it’s all set up in the inciting incident that opens the film. It sets the story in motion. That is its function.

		Depending on the kind of story you’re writing, the inciting incident will either be action-driven or character-driven. It does not have to be a tense action or dramatic sequence—it can be a scene involving a situation. In Chinatown, the inciting incident is Gittes’s being hired by the phony Mrs. Mulwray, and the key incident comes when the real Mrs. Mulwray confronts Gittes. The inciting incident always leads us to the key incident, which is the hub of the story line, the engine that powers the story forward. The key incident reveals to us what the story is about.

		In Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the history of the ring is revealed in the first few pages as it is being forged in the fires of Mount Doom: There were “20 rings made, three were given to the Elves…seven to the Dwarf-Lords,…and nine rings were gifted to the race of Men…but they were all of them deceived…” Another ring was made: “One Ring to rule them all…” Then, in a series of cinematic vignettes, we trace its path of power and evil: “And some things that should not have been forgotten…were lost.” We see Gollum worship the ring, then lose it, and it lies there, forgotten, until Bilbo Baggins finds it at the bottom of a murky pool and takes it home to the Shire.

		So it begins. This prologue, this inciting incident, is what grabs our attention, and through the voice-over narration and various images it gives us the information we need to know, thus setting up the entire story of the three episodes of Lord of the Rings.

		Once we’ve established the inciting incident, the story begins. The Wizard Gandalf arrives in the Shire and we’re introduced to him as well as to Frodo, Sam, and the others as Bilbo throws his birthday celebration. Time for him to move on, Bilbo tells Gandalf. When the Wizard hears Bilbo’s farewell and watches him disappear at his birthday celebration, he demands to see the ring. Immediately, we see the effect the ring has on Bilbo; he’s rude, mean, and turns nasty until Gandalf confronts him. And then, when Bilbo leaves on his journey, his nephew Frodo inherits the ring. It is the key incident in the story line; Frodo’s inheritance, his dramatic need, is to return the ring to the fires of Mount Doom and destroy it. That is what the story is all about. And when Gandalf learns the origins, history, and mystery of the ring, when he learns of its power, only then does he realize that Sauron’s riders, the dark forces of evil, are at this very moment searching for the ring. It is too dangerous for it to remain in the Shire. Frodo, by fate, destiny, or karma, becomes the ring bearer; the ring now becomes his physical, emotional, and mental burden to bear.

		This is the key incident of the screenplay. It begins Frodo’s journey to Mount Doom. The journey begins and the Fellowship of the Ring is formed.

		The inciting incident and the key incident—Bilbo’s finding the ring and Frodo’s, by necessity and design, inheriting it and taking responsibility for it—are related. These two incidents are essential parts of the whole that must be established when you are setting up the screenplay.

		Many times the key incident and Plot Point I are the same. American Beauty represents this very well. When we first meet Lester Burnham, he tells us in voice-over narration, “I’m forty-two years old. In less than a year, I’ll be dead….In a way, I’m dead already.” We’re introduced to his family, watch as they prepare for the day. As they drive to work and school, Lester says in a voice-over: “My wife and daughter think I’m this gigantic loser, and they’re right….I have lost something. I’m not sure what it was, but…I feel sedated….But you know, it’s never too late to get it back.”

		American Beauty is a story of resurrection and rebirth, of finding a reason, or purpose, for living. Lester’s loaded little statement is what sets the story in motion; it is the inciting incident. In voice-over narration, it tells us that Lester Burnham is a man who wants to regain his sense of aliveness, his sense of well-being, his sense of contentment. That’s his dramatic need. Once this is established in the opening scenes, we follow Lester, wife Carolyn, and daughter Jane as they go through their “day in the life.” Lester goes to his job, which he hates; real estate agent Carolyn is determined to sell a house; and Jane goes off to school. Then, in one of my favorite scenes, they come home and we see them at dinner. From the outside it looks warm and inviting, like a Norman Rockwell picture of the ideal American family. But that’s only on the outside; on the inside, they’re totally dysfunctional.

		Later, Jane and her friend Angela are preparing to perform their cheerleader routine at the basketball half-time festivities. Carolyn insists on coming to watch because she wants to “support” their daughter. Lester doesn’t want to be there: “I’m missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.” They arrive, get settled, then watch the group perform their routine. Lester’s attention is drawn to Angela, and as he focuses on her, we get closer and closer to her and enter the subjective realm of Lester’s head. In a dazzling cinematic display, we see his vision of Angela. The external sound stops, the music gets wacky, and we zoom in close on Angela. Now her routine turns into an erotic, hypnotic display of fantasy and suggestion.

		This is a marvelous filmic presentation of the key incident of the movie, because it is this incident that totally turns Lester’s life around. Not only is it the key incident of the film, it’s also Plot Point I. Seeing Lester’s fantasy is the incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction, in this case Act II. Lester is suddenly brought back to life. It is a sequence that visually illustrates what the story is all about: Angela becomes the focus of Lester’s fantasy, his infatuation, the very reason and purpose of his being alive, something to live for. This is shown after the half-time festivities, when Lester makes a fool of himself fawning over Angela. “Could he be any more pathetic?” Jane asks her friend after her parents leave.

		Of course, he is pathetic, but Lester’s reawakening is the key incident in the screenplay. To show this we cut to Lester lying awake in the glow of his fantasy, watching, in his mind’s eye, Angela beckoning to him on a carpet of rose petals. He says, “I feel like I’ve been in a coma for about twenty years and I’m just now waking up.” His journey into “life” is about to begin. How he does this and the changes and obstacles he confronts are what this story is all about.

		At the end, he is happy and content as he sits in the kitchen looking at pictures of his family taken many years before, when they were “startlingly happy.” He stares at these photographs, and a smile appears on his face, a “deep satisfied smile” of peace and contentment. And then the gun enters the frame and the trigger is pulled.

		The key incident is what literally spins Lester’s life around in another direction and initiates his emotional journey, his transformation from despair to happiness. In this case, the key incident and Plot Point I happen to be the same thing. There are times when this happens, and other times when it doesn’t. The inciting incident and the key incident are related, but not always in the same way. It all depends on the story you’re telling. There are no magic formulas in screenwriting.

		In Mystic River, the inciting incident is in the past, when Dave (Tim Robbins) was abducted by the two perverts; it sets the story in motion and leads to the key incident: the discovery of Jimmy’s (Sean Penn’s) murdered daughter. It connects the story line in terms of “Who committed the murder?” to the inciting incident with Dave that opened the movie. In The Shawshank Redemption, we see the inciting incident wrapped in three different events: Andy on trial, Andy drunk in his car loading his gun, and Andy watching his wife and her boyfriend in a sexual embrace.

		Many people wonder about the distinctions between the dramatic premise—what the story is about (as mentioned in Chapter 2)—and the key incident we’re talking about. Are they the same? Both deal with the foundation of the story line, but the dramatic premise could be said to be a conceptual description of what the story is about, while the key incident would be that specific scene or sequence that is the dramatic visualization of what the story is about.

		Sometimes the key incident will be something that has affected your character’s life at an earlier time, as in Mystic River. Sometimes the story is about the person trying to piece together the fragments of his or her life. In The Bourne Supremacy, for example, the key incident is the murders Jason Bourne committed as a member of the Treadstone mission years earlier. He’s on a quest to rediscover his past. Everything bounces off and revolves around this key incident; the whole story leads up to it.

		The Manchurian Candidate (Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris; original screenplay by George Axelrod, based on the novel by Richard Condon) is very much the same; a key incident is “buried” within Ben Marco’s (Denzel Washington’s) mind and he has to unlock its mysteries before he can achieve his dramatic need. The same with Ordinary People; the entire screenplay revolves around the key incident of the drowning, which occurs before the story begins but is emotionally pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle and finally seen in its totality at Plot Point II.

		When you begin writing your screenplay, it’s essential that you know the distinctions between the inciting incident and the key incident. Why are they so important in setting up and establishing your story line? If we go back to Henry James’s statement—“What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?”—we see that the force of the key incident affects both the internal and external aspects of your character and story, as in Mystic River and Finding Neverland (David Magee).

		Act I is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately twenty or thirty pages long; it begins at the beginning of the screenplay and goes to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. It is held together with the dramatic context known as the setup. If you recall, context is the empty space that holds the content in place. This unit of dramatic action sets up your story; it sets up the situation and the relationships between the characters, and establishes the necessary information so the reader knows what’s happening and the story can unfold clearly.

		The first ten pages of your screenplay, as mentioned, establish three specific things. The main character is introduced so we know who the story is about. In Basic Instinct, after the murder, Michael Douglas is brought into the story when he investigates the crime scene. Who committed the murder and why? In American Beauty we know immediately that the story is about Lester Burnham; he is the main character. In Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, we immediately meet Frodo as Gandalf rides into the Shire.

		The second thing we create within this first ten-page unit of action is the dramatic premise. What is this story about? We can state it through dialogue, as in Chinatown, or show it visually, through the inciting incident, as in Crimson Tide. The third thing we need to establish is the situation, the circumstances surrounding the action, as in Mystic River, or Finding Neverland, or Sideways.

		The two incidents provide the foundation of the story line. The inciting incident sets the story in motion and the key incident establishes the story; it is the dramatic premise executed. If the key incident is the hub of the story, then all things—the actions, reactions, thoughts, memories, or flashbacks—are tethered to this one incident. So, you can tell your story in a linear fashion, as in Basic Instinct; or in flashback, as in American Beauty, The Bourne Supremacy, or The Manchurian Candidate; or even in a nonlinear way, as in Pulp Fiction.

		Pulp Fiction is an interesting film to examine within the context of these two incidents. When I first considered trying to identify and define them in Tarantino’s movie, I thought I was trying to put a round peg into a square hole. Was I trying to force the issue? Or was it something that I could now see differently as a result of my new awareness? I didn’t really have an answer, so I decided to just take a look and see what I came up with.

		So I traced my history with Pulp Fiction. To begin with, everybody knows Pulp Fiction has had a tremendous impact on world cinema. When it first came out, you either loved it or hated it. When I first saw it I hated it. But everyone kept telling me how wonderful it was, how different and intriguing, definitely a landmark film. Though I didn’t agree with that, I had to acknowledge that Pulp Fiction sparked a new awareness in the filmgoer’s consciousness. In my workshops and seminars around the world, everyone was talking about its impact.

		Even though we were riding the wave of a technology revolution in the mid-’90s, as far as I was concerned the real revolution was going to manifest itself more in terms of technology than in form and content—that is, what you showed and how you showed it. Pulp Fiction was definitely a part of that.

		When I began to reexamine it, I asked myself what made Pulp Fiction so influential. The answer, I knew, was in the screenplay. Was it the structure? Was it one of the characters getting killed in the middle of the movie and then the film’s coming back to the events that led up to his death? Was it the three stories? The bookend opening and closing?

		When you read the screenplay of Pulp Fiction, the first thing you see is the title page; it states that Pulp Fiction is really “three stories…about one story.” When you turn the page, there are two dictionary definitions of Pulp: “a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter,” and “a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.” That’s certainly an accurate description of the film. But on the third page, you might be surprised to find a Table of Contents. Kill Bill I and II is that way too; in fact, it has not only a Table of Contents, but chapter headings as well.

		I thought that was odd; who puts a Table of Contents in a screenplay? It states very clearly that the film is broken down into five individual parts: Part I, the Prologue; Part II, Vincent Vega and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife; Part III, The Gold Watch; Part IV, The Bonnie Situation; and Part V, the Epilogue.

		As I studied the script, I saw that all three stories really bounce off the key incident: Jules and Vincent retrieving Marcellus Wallace’s briefcase from the four kids. I saw that this one incident was really the hub of all three stories, and noticed that each story is structured as a whole, in linear fashion; it starts at the beginning of the action, goes into the middle, then proceeds to the end. Each section is like a short story, presented from a different character’s point of view.

		Thinking in terms of “three stories about one story” allowed me to see the film as one unified whole. Pulp Fiction is three stories surrounded by a prologue and an epilogue, what screenwriters call a bookend technique. The Bridges of Madison County, Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett), Saving Private Ryan, and American Beauty use this technique as well.

		The Prologue sets up Pumpkin and Honey Bunny in a coffee shop discussing various types of small-time robbery. It sets the first and last stories in motion. When the two finish their meal, they pull out their guns and announce the robbery. The film freezes and we cut to the main titles. Then we cut into the middle of a dialogue between Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) as they are driving, having an enlightening discussion about the relative merits of a Big Mac here and abroad.

		This little exchange sets up their characters, and when they stop and pull out their weapons we see the contradiction between their words and their actions. It literally sets up the film and tells us everything we need to know: The two men are killers working for Marcellus Wallace; their job, their dramatic need, is to retrieve the briefcase. That’s the true beginning of the story. In Part I, Jules and Vincent arrive, state their position, reclaim the briefcase, then kill three of the four guys they encounter. It’s only by the grace of God they’re not killed themselves. Only one other person, Marvin, survives, at least for the moment.

		Vincent takes Mia Wallace (Uma Thurmond) out to dinner, and after she accidentally overdoses, they say good night. Part III is about Butch and his gold watch and what happens when he wins the fight instead of losing it as he had agreed to do. In the middle of this section Butch (Bruce Willis) kills Vincent, who is at his apartment looking for him. Part IV deals with cleaning up Marvin’s remains, which are splattered all over the car, a continuation of Part I. That’s followed by the Epilogue, where Jules talks about his transformation and the significance of Divine Intervention and then Pumpkin and Honey Bunny resume the holdup that began in the Prologue. Pulp Fiction is a very novelistic presentation, as are Kill Bill I and II.

		It became very clear that no matter what form a film takes, whether linear or nonlinear, there is always going to be an inciting incident and a key incident. Kill Bill I and II is based entirely on the key incident of the story—the killing of The Bride’s (Uma Thurman’s) wedding party—and like Pulp Fiction is driven by the theme of revenge and unfolds in a novelistic way, complete with a Table of Contents and individual chapters, one of the interesting changes happening in the form right now.

		Structuring a nonlinear movie means defining each part, then structuring each section, whether in present time or past time, from beginning to end, at which point the screenwriter can build and arrange the parts in any order he or she desires. Courage Under Fire (Patrick Sheane Duncan) is a good example of this, as is Groundhog Day (Danny Rubin, Harold Ramis), The Usual Suspects, The English Patient, and Sliding Doors (Peter Howitt). These screenplays are introduced with the inciting incident, then structured around the key incident. Take a look at any of these films and see if you can identify and make the distinction between the inciting incident and the key incident.

		In my screenwriting workshops, I have my students focus on and define these two incidents before they write one word of screenplay. Once they know what the incidents are, they can fuse the action, characters, and events into a structured line of dramatic action, whether using a linear or nonlinear story line. It’s important to remember that structure is not something embedded in concrete, or something that is unbending, or unyielding; rather, it is flexible, like a tree that bends in the wind but doesn’t break. Understanding this concept allows you to play with the plotline so you can tell your stories visually, with narrative action rather than explanation.

		This is a relatively new shift in the craft of screenwriting. It wasn’t too long ago that characters had to explain who they were, what their background was, and what their motivation or purpose was. Things were explained through the character’s dialogue. As a matter of fact, explaining their story line through dialogue was one of the chief problems that aspiring screenwriters had when writing their screenplays. But there is a new generation of young people growing up with television, wireless technology, and PlayStation, and it’s pretty obvious their visual sense is heightened; as a result, we’re expanding the craft with stories that are more visual, while unfolding with clarity and simplicity. It is a clear sign of evolution at work.

		But though the form may be evolving, the simple tools of storytelling remain the same. What you write is just as important as how you write it.

		And that’s what it’s all about.

		Plot Points


		 			“Writing a screenplay is in many ways similar to executing a piece of carpentry. If you take some wood and nails and glue and make a bookcase, only to find when you’re done that it topples over when you try to stand it upright, you may have created something really very beautiful, but it won’t work as a bookcase.”

			—Adventures in the Screen Trade

			William Goldman





The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. When you sit down in front of 120 blank sheets of paper, the only way you can get through that intricate tangle of seemingly endless creative decisions, solutions, and choices is by knowing what you’re doing and where you’re going. You need a road map, a guide, a direction—a line of development leading from beginning to end.

		You need a story line.

		If you don’t have one, you’re in trouble. That’s why it’s so easy to get lost in the maze of your own creation. James Joyce, the great Irish novelist, once remarked that the experience of writing is like climbing a mountain: When you’re in the middle of your climb, you can only see what’s directly in front of you and what’s directly above you. You can plan only one move at a time. You can’t see two or three moves above you or how you’re going to get there. Only when you reach the top of the mountain can you look down and gain some kind of an overview of the landscape you’ve negotiated.

		It’s a good analogy. When you’re writing a screenplay, you can see only the page you’re writing and the pages you’ve written. Most of the time you can’t see where you’re going or how you’re going to get there. Sometimes you can’t even see that. The scene you’re going to write next is only some kind of vague notion, and you don’t know whether it will work or not. You literally have no objectivity at all—no overview.

		That’s why the paradigm is so important—it gives you a direction, a line of development. It’s like a road map. On the road, driving through Arizona, New Mexico, on through the vast reaches of Texas, and across the high plains of Oklahoma, you don’t know where you are, much less where you’ve been. All you can see is a flat, barren landscape, broken only by silver flashes of the sun bouncing off the windshields of passing cars.

		When you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm. That’s why Plot Points are so important. As defined, the Plot Point is “any incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction.” There are many Plot Points scattered throughout the screenplay, but when you’re confronting 120 blank sheets of paper, you need to know only four things to structure your story line: the ending, the beginning, and Plot Points I and II.

		The function of the Plot Point is simple: It moves the story forward. Plot Point I and Plot Point II are the story points that hold the paradigm in place. They are the anchors of your story line.

		Take another look at the paradigm:





		If you look at the screenplay as a series of story points, or story progressions, your story line begins at the beginning and ends at the end, whether in linear form as in Collateral, Thelma & Louise, or Million Dollar Baby, or in nonlinear form as in Cold Mountain, Pulp Fiction, or The Hours. No matter what form your story line is in, linear or nonlinear, it is anchored in place by Plot Points I and II.

		Structure is the foundation, the base, the blueprint of the screenplay; as William Goldman says, “Screenplay is structure.” If you don’t know the basic structure of your story line, you’re not really ready to start writing. That’s why I stress the importance of the four things you need to know before you put one word down on paper: the ending, beginning, and Plot Points I and II. If you don’t know those four points, you’re in trouble. This does not mean that there are only two Plot Points in your screenplay. That’s not the case at all. We’re dealing with the preparation you need to make before you begin writing. Once you know what these two Plot Points are, they will anchor your story line, hold it in place so you can begin the writing process with freedom and creativity. When the screenplay is completed, it may contain as many as ten to fifteen Plot Points, most of which will be in Act II. How many you have, again, depends upon your story. The purpose of the Plot Point is to move the story forward, toward the resolution. That is its purpose.

		In Michael Mann’s high-powered thriller Collateral (tautly written by Stuart Beattie), the action moves forward on both a physical and emotional level. The Tom Cruise character, Vincent, has a job to do—five contracted murders in one night. He forces Max (Jamie Foxx) to be his driver, makes physical threats on his life, but pays him well to drive him around. We discover what’s happening as Max discovers what’s happening. The action moves forward to the final shoot-out with clarity, ingenuity, character insight, and change. The film itself is “clean, lean and tight”; there’s not an ounce of “fat,” or padding, in the entire screenplay.

		The thrust of the script moves relentlessly forward from Plot Point to Plot Point. As a matter of fact, the characters’ arc and the arc of the story line impact each other, so that each physical incident reveals a different aspect of the characters. Foxx’s cabbie goes through a strong dramatic arc: from passive wimp to man of action; from dreamer to achiever. And the irony, of course, is that Max is forced into these changes by the villain of the piece; when Cruise destroys his old life, Foxx is forced to grab the new.

		The script opens with Vincent arriving at LAX and exchanging a black bag with an unknown accomplice; then we cut to and set up Max cleaning his taxi as he readies himself for the night shift. He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith)—the inciting incident—and during the ride downtown they develop an easygoing familiarity, an attraction, for each other. He delivers Annie to the Federal Building, and as she gets out she tells him she’s a prosecutor working an “all-nighter” on a big case and gives Max her card. He picks up another fare, Vincent, who hires him for the night to make the five stops to get “signatures” on a real estate deal he’s closing. So far, it’s just another night in L.A.

		As Vincent and Max banter about the state of L.A., they get to know each other a little more. They make stop number one, and Max is waiting in the alley behind the building when suddenly there’s a loud crash and a dead body plunges onto the front windshield. Shocked, stunned, disbelieving, Max is astonished to learn that Vincent killed the man, though the hit man claims “it was the bullet and the fall that killed him.”

		That’s Plot Point I, the key incident of the script. This is the incident that sets in motion the entire screenplay, because Max is now forced against his will to drive Vincent to his other “appointments.” He’s virtually a prisoner. Now, the true story begins.

		Two physical actions are going on in this story: (1), Max trying to escape from Vincent as they roam through the city; and (2), Vincent doing his job and honoring his contracts. As they make their appointed rounds, we watch Max reacting to the physical action by going through an emotional change that, step by step, leads to his transformation. In the beginning, he’s passive and weak, a wimp, afraid to stand up to his boss at the cab company. Then he begins to gain a little courage and tries to escape, but winds up watching helplessly as Vincent kills two guys trying to rip off his briefcase. They make a “random” visit to a nightclub, ostensibly to listen to some good jazz, but in fact it’s a cover for Vincent to score his next hit. This is a nice touch, setting us up to expect one thing, then turning it around. Then Max is made to visit his mother at the hospital, and once again tries to escape by running away with Vincent’s briefcase and, in defiance, tossing it onto the freeway. His attitude, his strength, is beginning to emerge; he’s starting to stand up for himself.

		After the briefcase episode Vincent forces Max, as a sort of punishment or test, to pose as him and meet Felix, the crime boss, to get the new information about the last two hits of the night. Max, in a tense and dramatic moment, rustles up his strength, threatens Felix, and manages to walk out of the meeting alive. This is another incident where the physical action triggers an emotional response.

		The cops, who think Max is the hit man responsible for all these murders, follow him to a nightclub, and there, on a crowded dance floor, there is a violent shoot-out. Max tries to get away, and when he is spotted by a cop who believes in his innocence, he’s hustled off to safety. When Vincent sees him with the cop, however, the hit man kills the cop and “rescues” Max.

		There’s one more hit for Vincent to fulfill. At this point, two things are left unresolved. One, how is Max going to get away from Vincent alive? And two, how is he going to prevent Vincent’s last hit? Racing away from the big shoot-out at the nightclub, Vincent says that Max’s dream of starting a limo company is only a dream, a “someday” excursion into a fantasy that will never happen. Max, for the first time, realizes that he has been living a dream for twelve years. Now his dream shattered, and knowing he’ll probably be killed by Vincent when this ordeal is over, he decides to give it all up and live for the moment. Otherwise, “What’s the point?” It is this insight that gives him the strength to put his foot on the gas for a wild speed run through the streets of L.A. He loses control of the wheel and crashes the car, hitting a divider. The car leaps into the air, hits the ground with a tremendous crash, and rolls. Plot Point II.

		Vincent crawls out of the torn and twisted wreckage, and runs. Max manages to crawl out of the overturned taxi, sees a picture of Annie, the woman he met earlier that evening, and realizes that she is the last victim on Vincent’s list. Which happens to be the reason why Vincent was at the Federal Building in the first place: She was supposed to be his first hit of the night. Max races on foot to warn Annie, and then we go into a chase sequence that ends the film.

		These two Plot Points anchor the story in place. Plot Point I is the true beginning of the story: the first murder and Max’s realization that Vincent is responsible for it. At Plot Point II, he crashes the car and stands up to Vincent, ready to kill him if need be, in order to save Annie. Each Plot Point is geared by both the emotional and physical forces working on the character; the outside events affect the interior, emotional life of the character and move the script to its next level of action.

		Once again, a Plot Point is a function of the main character and moves the story forward. It amps up the action and underscores the arc of the character: Vincent is a cynical, amoral person with no values of right and wrong; he’s merely doing a job, and he’s very good at it. He views the world and everyone in it as “a cosmic accident,” the product of random chance. There’s no meaning or significance to our lives because we’re nothing more than an infinitesimal speck of dust in the vast universe. If there’s no meaning to our existence, then our lives mean nothing, so taking a human life has little consequence. As Tolstoy said, without God, without a moral system of right and wrong, “anything is permissible.”

		Collateral is a very good example of how Plot Points hook into the story line and move it forward, influencing both the emotional and physical arc of the characters. The choices your characters make may very well determine the course and outcome of the story. The interplay between Max and Vincent and the choices they make bind them together in a unique and unusual situation that expresses the story’s dynamic in a visual, suspenseful way.

		The connections and interplay between the characters, of course, are essential to the movement and plotline of the story. Let’s take another look at Chinatown. As a mystery-detective story, Chinatown is structured from Plot Point to Plot Point, each Plot Point carefully moving the action forward from the beginning, when Gittes is hired by the phony Mrs. Mulwray, to the end, when Evelyn Mulwray is killed.

		The script opens with the question: Who is Mrs. Mulwray’s husband having an affair with? Gittes follows Mulwray to a number of the city’s reservoirs, then discovers him in the company of a young woman. He takes pictures and returns to the office, and as far as he’s concerned, the case is closed. But the next day, he learns someone has released the story, along with his pictures, to the newspaper.

		Who did it? And why?

		When Gittes returns to his office he finds a woman waiting to see him. “Have you ever seen me before?” she asks. She then tells him she is the real Mrs. Mulwray; since she did not hire him, she’s going to sue him and take away his detective license. But if she’s the real Mrs. Mulwray, who hired him to find out who Mulwray was having an affair with? And why? With the “love scandal” front-page news, he knows he’s been set up—framed. Someone wants him to take the fall. He’s going to find out who set him up. And why.

		End of Act I.

		What moment in this block of dramatic action hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction? When the real Mrs. Mulwray shows up. That’s the key incident in the story line.

		When the real Mrs. Mulwray enters the picture, the action shifts from a job completed to possible legal action and the loss of Jake’s license. He’d better find out who set him up—then he’ll find out why.

		Act II opens with Gittes driving up to the Mulwray house. Mrs. Mulwray tells him her husband might be at the Oak Pass Reservoir. Gittes goes to the reservoir, and there meets Lieutenant Escobar, a former colleague, who tells him that Mulwray is dead—drowned, apparently in an accident.

		Mulwray’s death presents another problem, or obstacle, for Gittes. Remember, the dramatic context for Act II is Confrontation.

		Gittes’s dramatic need is to find out who set him up, and why. So screenwriter Robert Towne creates obstacle after obstacle to keep the action going. Remember, if you know your character’s dramatic need you can create obstacles to it, and the story becomes your character’s overcoming these obstacles to achieve his/her dramatic need. Mulwray is dead. Murdered, Gittes finds out later. Who did it? And why? This is a Plot Point within the structure of Act II to keep the story moving forward. There are ten such Plot Points in the second act of Chinatown.

		Mulwray’s death is an incident that moves the story forward. Gittes is totally involved now, whether he likes it or not. Later, he receives a phone call from a mysterious “Ida Sessions”: the phony Mrs. Mulwray. She tells him to look in the obituary column of the paper for “one of those people,” whatever that means. Then she hangs up. Soon after, Ida Sessions is found murdered, and Escobar is certain Gittes is involved.

		The theme of water has been introduced several times before, and Gittes follows it. He checks out the owners of the land in the Valley and discovers that most of the acreage has been sold within the last few months.

		Gittes investigates, but is attacked by farmers who think he’s the man who’s been poisoning their water. When he regains consciousness, Evelyn Mulwray is there—called by the farmers. As they drive back to L.A., Gittes discovers that one of the names in the obituary column mentioned by Ida Sessions is cited as being the owner of a large parcel of land in the Valley. Strange. He died at a place called the Mar Vista Home for the Aged. Together, Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray drive to the retirement home. Gittes learns that most of the new owners of the land parcels in the Valley are living at the home, unaware of their purchases. It’s phony—the whole thing’s a giant scam. As they’re leaving, his suspicions confirmed, thugs attack him, but Evelyn drives up, steps on the gas, Gittes jumps on the running board, and they manage to get away.

		These incidents, episodes, and events are all Plot Points, all story progressions that move the story forward.

		Back at her house, Evelyn cleans Gittes’s nose wound (for being “too nosy”); he notices something in her eye, a slight color defect. He leans over and kisses her. They have sex.

		Afterward, they lie in bed making small talk.

		The phone rings. She answers it, suddenly becomes agitated, hangs up. She tells Gittes he must leave. Immediately. “Something important” has come up.

		At this point in the story, we still don’t know two things: (1) who the girl was who was with Mulwray in the beginning before he was murdered; and (2) who set up Gittes, and why. Gittes knows that the answers to the two questions are related. There’s a good chance that whoever killed Mulwray set him up. Why, we don’t know yet.

		Something has come up. What? Gittes wants to find out, so he tails Evelyn to a house in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles. When he returns to Evelyn’s house, he discovers a pair of bifocals in the bottom of the fish pond. He returns to the Echo Park house and confronts Evelyn. She tells him the girl is her sister, then says she’s her daughter. Gittes slaps her. “I want the truth,” he says. He slaps her again, and she finally confesses that the girl is “my daughter and my sister.” At fifteen, she was the victim of incest, and now cares for her daughter and refuses to speak to her father, Noah Cross. So, now we know who the girl is. The second point: Who wore the bifocals, victim or killer? Once Gittes learns the truth, he wants to help Evelyn get away. But before he leaves, at the end of the scene, in what seems to be a throwaway line, she tells Gittes that her husband did not wear bifocals. There is only one conclusion: The glasses were worn by the killer. Now Gittes knows the truth: Noah Cross had a motive for murder. It is the final answer he’s seeking and the Resolution, the solution of the story.

		Gittes calls Noah Cross and tells him he has “the girl,” and to meet him at Evelyn’s house. And here Gittes learns that the man responsible for the death of Mulwray and the others, the man responsible for the entire water scandal, is Noah Cross. Why? “Because it’s the future, Mr. Gittes. The future.” The way to create it, Cross says, is simple: “Either you bring the water to L.A., or you bring L.A. to the water.”

		That’s the dramatic hook of the movie. And it works, beautifully. The premise that money, power, and influence are corruptive forces is established; as Gittes says: “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it.” If you’ve got enough money and power, you can get away with anything—even murder.

		Gittes, now a prisoner, is taken to Chinatown so that Cross can claim his daughter/granddaughter. When Evelyn dies at the end of the film, Cross spirits his daughter/granddaughter away, and does indeed get away with murder. Ironically, the incident that drove Gittes off the police force in Chinatown has repeated itself: “I tried to help someone and all I ended up doing was hurting them,” he had said earlier.

		Full circle, turn. Gittes can’t deal with it. He has to be restrained; the last words of the script are forged in filmic consciousness: “Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown.”

		The Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II are there to hook in the action and spin it around in another direction. They are the hub of the story progression, amp the story up to the next level, and move it forward to its dramatic resolution.

		As a simple exercise, the next time you go to the movies or watch a film on DVD or cable (without commercial breaks), see if you can locate the Plot Points at the end of Act I and Act II. Every film you see will have definite Plot Points; all you have to do is find them. If you want, take a look at your watch anywhere from twenty to thirty minutes into the film (depending on its length, of course) and see if you can determine what the action point is; ask yourself what’s happening, or what’s going on in the story around this point in the action. There will be some kind of incident, episode, or event that will occur. Discover what it is, and when it occurs.

		Do the same for Act II. Around eighty or ninety minutes into the feature, check out what’s happening in the story line. What incident, episode, or event occurs that will lead us into Act III, the Resolution? What happens around this time in the movie? It’s an excellent exercise. The more you do it, the easier it gets. Pretty soon it will be ingrained in your consciousness; you’ll grasp the essential nature of the relationship between structure and story. Then you’ll see how the definition of dramatic structure—“a series of related incidents, episodes, and events leading to a dramatic resolution”—guides you through the story line. Plot Points are those incidents, episodes, and events that anchor your story line; they provide the foundation of the narrative line of action.

		Let’s take a look at the Plot Points in a couple of other films: The Matrix and Thelma & Louise.

		Here’s the paradigm:





		We’re looking for the Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II.

		In The Matrix, the opening scene shows us that this is no ordinary action sequence of flying fists, fired shots, and a few explosions. This is a totally unique sequence; it pits Trinity, a lone woman, against several armed policeman, all wearing bulletproof vests. Right before our eyes, in the most amazing physical feats, Trinity leaps up, is suspended in midair, then runs up walls and across ceilings in order to escape. She leaps from rooftop to rooftop, building to building, totally disregarding gravity as she flies through the air to reach the other side. From there, it’s a race against a huge garbage truck to reach the ringing telephone. She makes it in the nick of time and answers the phone just as the truck slams into the telephone booth.

		Whoa…if that’s not a grabber, I don’t know what is. In terms of information, we don’t know who Trinity is, whether she’s a “good guy” or a “bad guy,” nor do we know what the story’s about, or how she managed to escape the way she did. But as an opening this inciting incident certainly grabs our attention.

		At this point, we don’t know what the story is about or who it’s about. We need some exposition here, defined as the information needed to move the story forward, and that’s exactly what we get next. Neo, the main character, wakes up to the words “Follow the white rabbit” on his computer screen. There’s a knock on the door; it’s a girl with a white rabbit tattooed on her shoulder. He follows her to a club. There he meets Trinity and asks her about the Matrix. But she doesn’t explain anything; she only warns him that he’s in danger: “They’re watching you.” And, she stresses, “The truth is out there, Neo, and it’s looking for you and will find you, if you want it to.” Then she’s gone.

		What is the Matrix? Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) explains later that we’re inhabiting a parallel universe and the Matrix is a state of virtual reality, an illusion that we’ve all been programmed to accept as real. The truth, the “real” world, has been destroyed and re-created by a race of machines, artificial intelligence, and computers into a form of virtual reality.

		So begins the heroes’ journey. Morpheus, the rebel leader, is dedicated to waging war against the Matrix to reveal “the truth,” liberating humanity from the bondage of the machines. Morpheus believes in the prophecy that their only hope of winning is by finding “The One,” a human being endowed with godlike powers who will lead them in their war of liberation. And he believes Neo is “The One.” As Morpheus tells Neo, the mind and body are intertwined, and even though they are separate entities, if you can control your mind you can control reality, and thus control your destiny.

		That’s an ancient teaching from Eastern philosophy, brought into a contemporary situation, futuristic in thought and execution. Neo, like Hamlet or the warrior Arjuna in the classic Indian tale the Bhagavad Gita, must choose his own destiny. This theme of choice, of choosing the reality you wish to inhabit, is a recurring motif throughout the film. When Neo goes to work the next day, he is told he has to make a choice: to either be Thomas Anderson by day, or Neo, the self-styled rebel, his true self, by night. When he gets to his office, Neo receives a package and a cell phone pops out, ringing. Morpheus is on the line. He tells Neo, “They’re after you. There are only two ways for you to leave the building—either you choose to leave by the scaffolding hanging outside the window, or you choose to leave as a prisoner.” Like Hamlet and Arjuna, Neo embodies the stance of the reluctant hero: Before he can rise to another, higher level of consciousness, he must first accept himself and his destiny.

		He leaves as a prisoner, and is later wired, a bug planted deep within him. Trinity and the others pick Neo up under the bridge, but only after he is “debugged” will he be taken to meet Morpheus. This fusion of the ancient and the futuristic is embodied in the various names used in The Matrix. The rebel ship, the Nebuchadnezzar, for example, is named after the famed Babylonian king of the fifth century B.C. who is credited with tearing down and rebuilding the ancient temples; so he’s both a destroyer and builder. The name fits the ship’s destiny, for it houses the small rebel band determined to destroy the Matrix. In Greek mythology Morpheus is the god of Sleep, responsible for weaving the fabric of our dreams in the deep sleep state. Neo, of course, means “new,” and Trinity has several religious implications. These mythological echoes are simply a way of adding more insight and dimension to the story line.

		At this point, the story progresses by action and explanation. Only when Neo can accept being “The One” can he really be “The One.” In other words, what we believe to be true, is true. And this sets up Plot Point I.

		He has his first face-to-face meeting with Morpheus at Plot Point I. During the meeting, the key incident, Morpheus offers Neo a choice: Either take the Blue Pill and get ordinary reality or take the Red Pill and get the truth. Neo doesn’t hesitate—he takes the red one. Reality distorts as he falls between the corridors of virtual reality and the netherworld. In a sequence as bizarre and evocative as an H. R. Giger painting, Neo is reborn as a man freed from the restraints of his limited mind. As the embryo of himself, Neo must retrain both his body and his mind until he is capable of exploring the untapped resources of his unlimited self as seen in martial arts contests with Morpheus.

		Plot Point I is the true beginning of the story; it is the incident that hooks into the action and spins it around into Act II. The context of Act II is Confrontation, so Neo encounters obstacle after obstacle to achieve his dramatic need: to know the Matrix and to be self-realized. Plot Point I fulfills this function.

		Neo’s encounter with the Oracle is the Mid-Point of the story. She’s a great character. When I first saw the film I expected an old, old man, extremely wise, with white hair and possibly a long straggly beard. Instead, I was delightfully surprised to discover a middle-aged woman baking cookies. When she casually asks if he believes he’s “The One,” Neo shakes his head and says, “I’m just an ordinary guy.” Once again, his belief systems, the limitations of his mind, imprison him. Too bad, she says. Why? Neo asks. “Because Morpheus believes in you, Neo, and no one, not even you or me, can convince him otherwise,” she says. “He believes it so blindly that he’s going to sacrifice his life for you. You’re going to have to make a choice. On one hand, you’ll have Morpheus’s life…and on the other hand, you’ll have your own….One of you is going to die….Which one, will be up to you.”

		She is his “mirror,” reflecting what he believes, telling him what she sees within him. His struggle guides him to the understanding that he can wear the mantle of “The One” only if he chooses to. Only when we can give up the concepts of our limited self can we attain enlightenment and liberation. The reluctant hero must accept the challenge of being who he or she really is, in much the same way that Hamlet and Arjuna must choose to honor themselves and accept their destiny. Whether he likes it or not, Neo is “The One” who has been chosen to “set the times right.”

		When Agent Smith takes Morpheus prisoner, Neo makes his decision to rescue him. “The Oracle told me this would happen,” Neo says. “She told me I would have to make a choice….” He pauses, and in an early draft of the script says, “I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don’t try to help him, then I’m not even what I think I am….I’m going in after him.” When he declares himself in this fashion, it is the first step of accepting himself as “The One.” This, then, is Plot Point II. It leads to the Resolution of the story.

		At Plot Point I, Morpheus had asked Neo if he believed in fate. No, Neo had replied—“Because I don’t like the idea that I’m not in control of my life.” Whether he believes it or not, whether he knows it or not, he’s now in the hands of his fate, his destiny.

		After rescuing Morpheus, Neo doesn’t make it out of the Matrix in time and, in a tremendous fight scene, dies at the hands of Agent Smith. As Trinity stands over Neo’s inert body, she tells him what the Oracle has told her: that she would fall in love with the man who was “The One.” Even though Neo’s dead, she believes with all her heart that love is stronger than the physical body. She kisses him, then demands that he “get up.” Neo’s eyes flip open, and he’s resurrected. A miracle? Of course. But as Joseph Campbell states in The Power of Myth, the true hero has to die in order to be reborn. Once again, Neo has died so he can be reborn. How? It doesn’t matter. Either we believe it or we don’t; it is the willing suspension of disbelief. He has overcome the limitations of his mind; he has chosen to wear the mantle of “The One.”

		The Matrix was one of the first blockbuster films influenced by Asian filmmaking, and it portends a future direction in movies: technology integrated into a classical, mythical story line that is larger than life. It’s too bad that The Matrix: Reloaded and The Matrix: Revolutions don’t live up to the quality or creativity of the original.

		Thelma & Louise, like Collateral, is a story that deals with character change and transformation. When the film begins, Louise is finishing up her night shift at the restaurant where she works. It is early morning, and she calls Thelma, who is in the kitchen preparing breakfast. We immediately see who Thelma is. Her breakfast is a bite out of a frozen candy bar. From our very first glimpse, Thelma appears to be a little bit ditzy. Louise asks if she’s ready to go for their weekend trip to the mountains. Thelma replies she hasn’t asked her husband Darryl yet, but when he appears, she hangs up hastily. Our impression of her husband is that he’s a pompous, self-centered ass. Thelma hesitates to ask him, finally decides not to, and makes up her mind on the spot to go away with Louise for the weekend anyway.

		After her husband leaves for work, Thelma starts packing, and, in a beautiful display of film as behavior, we see two people doing the same thing in totally different ways; we see who they are by what they do. Here’s the way Thelma packs: She stands in front of her closet, and though she’s going away for only a couple of days, she doesn’t know what to take. So, she takes everything: bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweater, T-shirts, a couple of dresses; she grabs most of her closet and dumps it in her suitcases. Then she takes a lantern and several pairs of shoes, and, as an afterthought, grabs a gun by the handle, holding it like a rat by the tail, and drops it in her purse. What do we know about her from the way she packs?

		Here’s the way Louise packs: She puts the suitcase on the bed; everything is perfectly ordered. She neatly folds, as the script puts it: “three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown. She could be packing for camp. Her room is as orderly as the suitcase. As an afterthought, she throws in an extra pair of socks and closes the suitcase.” On the way out, she calls her boyfriend Jimmy, and when his answering machine picks up, she angrily turns his picture facedown. She goes to the sink, rinses the only glass that’s on the counter, wipes it, puts it back in the cupboard, and leaves in her beautiful T-Bird. Spotless. What do we know about her character from the way she packs? Film is behavior.

		She picks up Thelma and they drive toward their weekend retreat. But along the way Thelma begs her to stop so they can get something to eat. They pull into a bar called, appropriately enough, the Silver Bullet. That occurs on about page 10 of the screenplay. We already know who the story is about, as well as their relationships with the men in their life. We learn they are on this weekend holiday because Louise wants to prove a point to her boyfriend Jimmy. A musician, he’s been on the road for three weeks, and has not called her once. She’s so pissed that she’s not going to be home when he returns. Let’s see how he likes that!

		In an interview I had with writer Callie Khouri for my book Four Screenplays, she told me, “Jimmy is a guy who’s afraid to make a commitment. She wants to get married, wants all the conventional things, yet she’s being denied them because of the choice she’s made in this man. Basically, his shortcoming is holding her back from what she really wants.

		“I wanted to show her feelings because she feels responsible for everything that happens. She plays a game with him; when he comes back from his trip, she’s not going to be in town, and this is what happens when she’s not being honest.”

		Not being honest in her relationship leads to what eventually happens. It’s not dharmic, meaning it’s not the “right action” based on the moral and ethical principles of the universe. In other words, it’s uncool. Thelma and Louise go into the bar, order drinks, talk about their relationships. Then a stranger named Harlan approaches, makes himself comfortable at their table, and starts hustling Thelma. Louise shoos him away, but later he comes back and he and Thelma step onto the dance floor. He plies her with drinks, gets her so dizzy she thinks she’s going to be sick, then takes her outside to the parking lot.

		And there, what starts as a “friendly” little kiss turns into a pretty ugly scene. He attempts to rape Thelma, and almost gets away with it. After slapping her around, he flips up her dress, knocks her legs apart, unzips his pants. We hear the crunch of gravel, and then a gun enters the frame at his head. Louise. She tells him to stop, adding, “You’ve got a pretty fucked-up idea of fun.” He mouths off to her and says one thing too much, and Louise “raises the gun, and fires a bullet into his face.” He’s killed instantly.

		Plot Point I—the true beginning of the story; the “incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction.” What began as a nice weekend trip to the mountains ends up in an attempted rape and murder. From here on out, Thelma and Louise are on the run, and as they race down the highway, like so many other characters in so many other movies, they come to grips with themselves, find out who they really are, and ultimately end up taking responsibility for their lives and actions. Thelma & Louise is a road movie, yes, but it’s really a journey of enlightenment and self-discovery.

		Their dramatic need has changed now and there is no turning back as they race toward Mexico a step ahead of the law. As they drive through Monument Valley in Utah, Louise stops the car. In the vast and towering silence, she steps out of the car and drinks in this most memorable sight. She now knows that this might be her last night on Earth, at least in this lifetime. That realization, experienced in total silence, is Plot Point II. In the next scene, she shares this insight with Thelma. Thelma thanks her for what she did, because Harlan was hurting her. The two women are bonded together in friendship and forgiveness.

		It’s a beautiful moment. In silence, underneath a blanket of stars, in a place that exists beyond time, they accept themselves and their destiny. For the first time, they understand there may be no way back. The stillness of the scene is the pause before the storm, and the silence works better and more effectively than words ever could.

		This little scene is the Plot Point at the end of Act II. It spins the story line into Act III, the Resolution, because at this point in the story, we don’t know what’s going to happen. Will they get caught or escape safely to Mexico? More important, will they live or die? From now on, through the rest of the story line, they resolve their feelings for each other and take full responsibility for their actions. From here on, there’s no turning back for Thelma and Louise. There are no options left: It’s death or it’s death.

		It should be noted that a Plot Point does not have to be a dramatic moment, or a major scene or sequence. A Plot Point can be a quiet moment, as in Plot Point II in Thelma & Louise, or an exciting action sequence, as in Plot Point I in Collateral, or a line of dialogue, as in The Matrix, or a decision that affects the story line, as in Chinatown. A Plot Point is whatever you choose it to be—it could be a long scene or a short one, a moment of silence or of action; it simply depends on the script you’re writing. It’s the choice of the screenwriter, but it is always an incident, episode, or event that is dictated by the needs of the story.

		Knowledge and mastery of the Plot Point is an essential requirement of writing a screenplay. As you approach the 120 blank sheets of paper, the Plot Points at the end of each act are the anchoring pins of dramatic action; they hold everything together. They are the signposts, the goals, the objectives, the destination points of each act—forged links in the chain of dramatic action.

		The Scene


		 			RICK:

			“Inside both of us, we both know you belong with Victor….If that plane leaves the ground and you’re not with him, you’ll regret it—oh, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.”

			ILSA:

			“What about us?”

			RICK:

			“We’ll always have Paris. We didn’t have it; we’d lost it before you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night….Ilsa, I’m no good at being noble, but it doesn’t take much to see that the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world….Someday you’ll understand that. Here’s looking at you, kid.”

			—Casablanca

			Julius and Philip Epstein, Howard Koch





Casablanca is an extraordinary film experience, one of those rare and magical moments that reside deep within our collective film consciousness. What makes it such a great film? What makes it stand out so vividly in the fabric of our film experience? Many things, of course, but in own my personal opinion, Rick is a character who, through his words and actions, sacrifices his life for the higher good. In The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell says the hero has “to die in order to be reborn.” When Casablanca begins, Rick has been living in the past, harboring the emotional pain of his lost love affair with Ilsa. When she reenters his life, Rick laments, “Of all the lousy gin joints, in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine,” and we know it’s time for him to deal with, confront, and embrace the past.

		What makes Bogart so memorable in this film? I think it’s a combination of two things: his screen persona and the part itself, which morphs into Bogart’s mythological stature. In their screenplay, Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch have fashioned a character who is tough and fearless and possessed of a strong moral center and the proverbial heart of gold. He’s one of the “good guys,” and his action at the end of the film, letting Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) escape to Lisbon to continue their fight against the Germans, serves a much higher purpose than would his and Ilsa’s personal love affair. “I’m no good at being noble,” he tells Ilsa, “but it doesn’t take much to see that the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.”

		By his actions, Rick is transformed; he has sacrificed his own personal love for Ilsa to aid and benefit the Allies in defeating the Nazis.

		“A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself,” Joseph Campbell says. If you look at the template of the classical “hero” throughout myth and literature, Rick’s action elevates him to the stature of a contemporary hero. “Life consists in action,” Aristotle said, “and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.” The same with Hamlet, or Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, or Neo in The Matrix: characters who have overcome their doubts and fears, then pushed them aside and acted. It is this action that elevates them into the realm of “heroic figures.”

		No matter what’s in Rick’s heart, it’s his quality of character, his action, that drives the story line forward. The ancient Indian scriptures call it dharma, or righteous action, and it thrusts Bogart, in this case, to the level of a heroic figure. His stature, his personification of the nobility of the human spirit, stands as a beacon of humanity that crosses all barriers of time, culture, and language.

		Good scenes make good movies. When you think of a good movie, you remember scenes, not the entire film. Think of Psycho. What scene do you recall? The shower scene, of course. It’s a classic. The scene is the single most important element in your screenplay. It is where something happens—where something specific happens. It is a particular unit, or cell, of dramatic (or comedic) action—the place in which you tell your story.

		The way you present your scene on the page ultimately affects the entire screenplay. A screenplay is a reading experience before it becomes a movie experience.

		The purpose of the scene is twofold: Either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the character. If the scene does not satisfy one, or both, of these two elements, then it doesn’t belong in the screenplay.

		A scene can be as long or as short as you want it to be. It can be an essential story beat (progression), or it can be a transition, a way to bridge the elements of place and time. It can be a complicated three-page dialogue scene or as simple as a single shot, like a car streaking down the highway. It can be a complicated flashback scene (or as I like to call it, a flashpresent scene) like the jailbreak scene in The Shawshank Redemption where Andy Dufrense escapes. The scene can be anything you want it to be. That’s the beauty of it.

		It is the story that determines how long or how short your scene is. There is only one rule to follow: Tell your story. The scenes will be as long or as short as they need to be; just trust the story and it will tell you everything you need to know.

		Throughout my many years of teaching, I’ve noticed that some people have a tendency to want to make a rule for everything. If there happens to be eighteen scenes in the first act of a screenplay or movie, they feel their first act must have eighteen scenes. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been awakened in the middle of the night by a hysterical writer on the phone saying, “My pages are too long,” or “Act I is thirty-five pages long,” or “My Plot Point I happens on page nineteen”; then I hear labored breathing in my ear, followed by a plaintive cry: “What do I do?”

		I listen and always give them the same answer: “So what!” So what if your first act is too long; so what if Plot Point I occurs on page 19. So what! You can’t write a screenplay following numbers as you would a drugstore painting. It is the form of the screenplay that’s important—beginning, middle, and end—not the numbers on the page. The paradigm is only a guide, not an absolute! Writing a screenplay that way doesn’t work—trust your story to tell you what you need to know, what scenes you need to write, or what scenes not to write.

		We’re going to approach our analysis of the scene from two different perspectives. First, we’re going to explore the generalities of the scene—that is, the form; then we’ll examine the specifics, how you create a scene from the elements, or components, you have within that scene.

		First, the form. Two things are necessary in every scene—place and time. They are the two components that hold things in context. Every scene occurs at a specific place and at a specific time.

		Where does your scene take place? In an office? A car? At the beach? In the mountains? On a crowded city street? What is the location of the scene? Does the scene take place inside or outside, interior or exterior? Designate interior by INT. and exterior by EXT.

		The other element is time. What time of the day or night does your scene take place? In the morning? Afternoon? Late at night? All you have to do is specify either day or night. But sometimes you may want to be more specific: sunrise, early morning, late morning, midafternoon, sunset, or dusk. These distinctions are necessary, because the light is different at each time of the day. The delineations allow the director of photography to set up his or her lights for the scene properly. And that can be a big job. All you need to indicate is DAY or NIGHT.

		So the heading of the scene (the slug line) becomes, for example, INT. LIVING ROOM—NIGHT or EXT. STREET—DAY.

		That’s the context: place and time. These two ingredients are what you must know before you start writing and constructing your scene. If you change either place or time, it becomes a new scene. Why? Because each time you change one of these elements, you have to change the lighting of the scene and, almost always, the camera placement, which means the lights, dolly tracks, electrical equipment, and many other things.

		For example, we saw in the first ten pages of Chinatown that Curly, in Jake’s office, is upset because Gittes showed him that his wife was having sex with a stranger. Gittes gives him a drink of cheap whiskey, then escorts him out of his office into the reception area.

		When they move from Gittes’s office into the reception area, it is a new scene. Why? Because they have changed place, gone from one place, the office, to another place, the reception area. New scene. That requires a new setup of lights and camera.

		Gittes is then called into his associates’ office, where we meet the phony Mrs. Mulwray. The scene in the associates’ office is also a new scene, even though it’s the same action. Once again, they have changed the place of the scene; one scene takes place inside Gittes’s office, another in the reception area, and another in his associates’ office. There’s one line of action—Gittes’s being hired by the phony Mrs. Mulwray—but there are three different scenes that make up this office sequence.

		If your scene takes place in a house, and you move from the bedroom to the kitchen to the living room, you have three individual scenes. Your scene might take place in the bedroom between a man and a woman. They kiss passionately, then move to the bed. At the window we see the light change from night to day, then when we cut back to our couple waking up, it is another, new scene. Why? You have changed the time of your scene. That means lights have to be changed and repositioned. It becomes a new location.

		If your character is driving a car up a mountain road at night and you want to show him at different locations, you must change your scenes accordingly: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD—NIGHT to EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD, FARTHER—NIGHT.

		The physical necessity of changing the position of the CAMERA (the word CAMERA is always capitalized in the screenplay) or the physical location requires striking one set and building another. Each scene requires a change in CAMERA position and therefore requires a change in the physical components of the scene. That’s why movie crews are so large and the cost of filming a movie has become so expensive. As the price of labor escalates, the cost per minute increases and we end up paying more at the box office. At this writing, it costs $10,000 or more per minute to film a major movie production. (Independent film is different, of course.)

		Scene changes are essential to your screenplay. The scene is the cell, or kernel, of the action, where it all happens—where you tell your story in moving pictures.

		A scene can be constructed in several different ways, depending on the type of story you’re telling. For many types of scenes you can build the action in terms of beginning, middle, and end; a character enters the place—restaurant, school, home—and the scene unfolds in linear time, much the way a screenplay unfolds. The opening scene in Chinatown between Gittes and the phony Mrs. Mulwray starts at the beginning and ends at the end. Many times one might show a snippet of an action at the beginning, a major portion of it in the middle, and another part of it at the end. Or you can begin a scene, cut away to a flashback, as in The Bourne Supremacy or Ordinary People, then bring it back to the present and end it in real time. The scene in Thelma & Louise where Thelma robs a convenience store is a good example of this. The scene starts with Thelma racing out of the convenience store yelling to Louise to “go…go.” Louise asks what’s happening and we cut to a video scene of Thelma robbing the store; then we pull back and we’re in police headquarters, with the police watching the video; then we cut back to Louise and Thelma and they’re again in present time, still on the run.

		Again, there’s no rule—it is your story, so you make the rules. Sometimes, in certain situations, it’s good to lay out the action line of the scene in terms of beginning, middle, and end, and then use only portions, or bits and pieces, of the action line to present the scene.

		Every scene must reveal one element of necessary story information to the reader or audience; remember, the purpose of the scene is to either move the story forward or to reveal information about the character. Rarely does a scene provide more than one piece of information. Many times I’ll read scenes where the writer includes two, sometimes three pieces of information, and it’s way too much. It bogs down the narrative line and can be confusing.

		Generally, there are two kinds of scenes. One is where something happens visually, like an action scene—the opening of The Matrix, for example, or the battle scenes in Cold Mountain. The other is a dialogue scene between two or more characters, as in Casablanca, or the famous “slapping” scene in Chinatown, or the various wonderfully inventive scenes in The Royal Tenenbaums and Magnolia. Most scenes are a combination. In a dialogue scene, there’s usually some action going on, and in an action scene, there’s usually some dialogue.

		Since one page of screenplay equals approximately one minute of screen time, most dialogue scenes need be no longer than two or three pages. That’s two or three minutes of screen time, and believe it or not, that’s an enormous amount of screen time. I had a student once who wrote a seventeen-page dialogue scene in a romantic comedy. Needless to say, it was way, way too long. I made cuts to the scene and it ended up a little over three and a half pages. This is a general rule, of course, and there are always exceptions. There are times when a dialogue scene is highlighted by strong background action, like the scene in Collateral where Max drives faster and faster until he crashes the cab into the street barrier.

		Within the body of the scene, something specific happens—your characters move from point A to point B in terms of emotional growth or reaching a decision; or your story links point A to point B in terms of the narrative line of action, the plot. Your story always moves forward, even if parts of it are told in flashback, as in The English Patient, The Bourne Supremacy, Casablanca, Memento, The Hours, and many other films.

		In The Hours, the three stories are interrelated with flashbacks that move the story forward. All three stories begin with the main characters waking up in the morning and end during the evening hours. Basically, it’s one day in the life of three characters. The entire piece is structured to include flashbacks as an integral part of the story. The flashback is a technique used to expand the audience’s comprehension of story, characters, and situation. The purpose of the flashback is the same as the scene—either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the characters.

		How do you go about creating a scene?

		First create the context of the scene, then determine the content, what happens. What is the purpose of the scene? Why is it there? How does it move the story forward? What happens within the body of the scene? Where has the character just been before he or she enters the scene? What are the emotional forces working on the character during the scene? Do they impact the purpose of the scene?

		Sometimes an actor approaches a scene by finding out what he’s doing there—his purpose—then where he’s coming from, and then where he’s going after the scene concludes. What is his/her purpose in the scene? Why is he/she there? To move the story forward or to reveal information about the character?

		As writer, it’s your responsibility to know why your characters are in a scene, what the purpose of the scene is, and how the characters’ actions, or dialogue, are relevant to the story. You’ve got to know what happens to your characters in the scenes, as well as what happens to them in between the scenes: What happened during the time between the office Monday afternoon and the next scene, Thursday night at dinner? If you don’t know, who does?

		By creating context, you determine dramatic purpose and can build your scene line by line, action by action. By creating context, you establish content.

		How do you do this?

		By finding the components or elements within the scene. What aspect of your character’s professional life, personal life, or private life is going to be revealed?

		Let’s go back to the story of three people stealing moon rocks from NASA’s Houston complex. We need to write a scene showing our characters committing to the caper. Up to this point, they’ve only talked about it. Now they decide to do it. That’s the context. Next, content.

		Where does the scene take place?

		At home? In a bar? Inside a car? Walking in the park? Maybe a quiet location, like a rented van on the highway? That might work, but maybe there’s a more visual approach we can take—this is, after all, a movie.

		Actors often play “against the grain” of a scene; that is, they approach the scene not from the obvious approach but from the unobvious approach. For example, they’ll play an “angry” scene smiling softly, hiding their rage or anger beneath a façade of niceness. Brando was a master at this.

		When you’re approaching a scene, look for a way that dramatizes the scene “against the grain” or a location that could make it visually interesting. In Silver Streak, Colin Higgins wrote a love scene between Jill Clayburgh and Gene Wilder in which they talk about flowers! It’s beautiful. Orson Welles, in The Lady from Shanghai, plays a love scene with Rita Hayworth in an aquarium, in front of sharks and barracudas.

		In our moon rock story, instead of setting the “decision” scene in a quiet location like the van, suppose we wrote it in a crowded pool hall, at night. We could introduce an element of suspense into the scene as well; as our characters shoot pool and discuss the decision of pulling the job, suppose an off-duty security cop enters and starts wandering around, adding a touch of dramatic tension. (Hitchcock did this kind of thing all the time.) We might open with a shot of the eight ball, then pull back to reveal our characters leaning over the table, talking about the job.

		Suppose we wanted to write a scene establishing the disintegrating emotional connections in a family. How could we do it?

		First, establish the purpose of the scene. In this case we want to show the relationship of the family, how its members relate to themselves and each other. Second, where does the scene takes place, and when, either day or night. It could take place anywhere: in a car, on a walk, in a movie theater, in the family dining room.

		In American Beauty there’s a great scene illuminating the dysfunctional aspects of Lester and his family. Lester, his wife, Carolyn, and their daughter, Jane, are having dinner together after a day we’ve observed. Screenwriter Alan Ball sets the scene in the dining room, a place that looks beautiful: low lighting, a marvelously set table, candles burning, a romantic version of “You Are Too Beautiful” playing in the background, vibrant roses on the table. In short, everything “looks” great; at least, on the outside. It could be a scene from a Norman Rockwell painting. That’s the context.

		What’s the purpose of the scene? To show the family dynamic. So while everything looks great on the outside, what’s going on inside? First, Jane complains about the music: “Mom, do we have to listen to this elevator music?” To which Carolyn replies, “No. As soon as you’ve prepared a nutritious yet flavorful meal that I’m about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.” Lester inquires about Jane’s day at school, to which she replies: “It was okay.” “Just okay?” Lester asks. She looks at her parents, then sarcastically says: “It was spec-tac-ular.” Lester complains about his job, then whines that Jane doesn’t even listen to him anymore. She replies, “You’ve barely even spoken to me for months.” And she gets up and leaves the table. Carolyn looks at Lester critically, and he mumbles: “What, you’re Mother of the Year? You treat her like an employee….You treat us both like employees.” And he abruptly leaves the table and tries to mend things with Jane in the kitchen, leaving Carolyn sitting alone in this beautiful space, listening to the haunting musical refrains of John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman: “You are too beautiful…”

		It’s an extraordinary scene! It shows us the outside as well as the inside. Inside, we see a totally dysfunctional family. The characters are illuminated by their contained dissatisfaction, with themselves as well as each other. It says so much with so little. It is a perfect illustration of setting up the context and revealing the dysfunctional aspects of the family through the content.

		When you’re preparing to write a scene, first establish the purpose, then find the components, the elements contained within the scene. Then determine the content. Suppose you wanted to set a scene in a restaurant. What components could you effectively use? Possibly the waiter has a cold, or is starting to come down with one; or maybe he or she is overworked, has too many stations to cover; maybe he had a disagreement with his significant other just before he came to work; or maybe a couple at a nearby table is having an argument that begins in a subdued fashion, but soon escalates and intrudes on the characters in your scene. Let something happen that could possibly impact the characters. Look for any ingredients you might use that could generate some form of conflict, either inside the characters or within the restaurant itself.

		The content of the scene now becomes part of the context.

		This allows you to stay on top of your story, and not let the story be on top of you. As a writer, you must exercise choice and responsibility in the creative decisions you make and in the construction and presentation of your scene. After all, it’s the character’s choice within the narrative that determines the flow of the story line.

		Within the context of the scene you can influence tone, feeling, and mood by the descriptions you write. In Collateral, screenwriter Stuart Beattie sets up Los Angeles in short, choppy strokes: “Shades of yellow. Ribbons of silver. Shimmers of chrome. Headlights sweeping past, flaring to white. Brake lights flashing, halating red. Reflections of overhead fluorescence flowing like liquid along the windshields of glass…” The style, the descriptions of the city portray a heightened sense of filmic reality, something we can see, a feeling experienced, the pounding pulsations of the city at night. And Michael Mann, the director, brilliantly brings it to life.

		In Collateral, the Plot Point at the end of Act II is an action-charged scene where Vincent shatters Max’s dream during a wild taxi ride after the chaotic shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. It’s a great example of how dialogue can reveal character as well as amp up the tension within a scene. The scene begins after Vincent “rescues” Max from the LAPD detective, Fanning (Mark Ruffalo). Vincent yanks Max back into the cab and they take off, heading downtown.

			STRAIGHT DOWN from above. Acid-mint streetlight in pools on Olympic Blvd. The yellow cab is the only vehicle heading east. Everything else streams west. Emergency vehicles. Flashers.

			INT. MAX’S CAB—MAX

			In shock. Back in purgatory…eternally in his cab’s front seat. As the lone yellow cab drives east…

			VINCENT

			What a clusterfuck. Only thing didn’t show was the Polish cavalry.

			Max’s life, controlled by Vincent, is a nightmare, perpetual and eternal. Now Vincent realizes he’s getting the silent treatment.

			(Continued)

			VINCENT

			You’re alive. I saved you. We’re BREATHING. Do I get any thanks? No. All you can do is clam up. You don’t wanna talk, tell me to fuck off…

			MAX

			(inaudible)

			…fuck off.

			Vincent’s attention goes to the window, out which are streams of emergency vehicles…looks to the airspace, filled with LAPD and news helicopters.

			EXT. STREET—THE ANONYMOUS YELLOW CAB

			MAX (O.S.)

			You had to kill Fanning?

			VINCENT (O.S.)

			Who the fuck is Fanning?

			INT. CAB

			MAX

			That cop!

			(beat)

			Why’d you have to do that? You coulda wounded him. Maybe he had a family, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he believed me, he was a good guy…

			VINCENT

			I shoulda saved him ’cause he believed you…?

			MAX

			No, not just that.

			VINCENT

			Yeah, that…

			MAX

			Yeah, so, what’s wrong with that?

			VINCENT

			It’s what I do for a living…

			MAX

			Some living.

			VINCENT

			Head downtown.

			MAX

			What’s downtown?

			VINCENT

			How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.

			MAX

			(grim)

			One more.

			VINCENT

			There you go…!

			MAX

			Whyn’t you kill me and find another cab?

			VINCENT

			’Cause you’re good. And we’re in this together. You know…

			(beat)

			…fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence. All that crap…

			MAX

			You’re full of shit.

			VINCENT

			I’m full of shit?

			(beat)

			VINCENT (CONT’D)

			You’re a monument of it. You even bullshitted yourself, all I am is taking out the garbage. Killing bad people…

			(Continued)

			MAX

			’Cause that’s what you said…

			VINCENT

			And you believed me…?

			MAX

			What’d they do?

			VINCENT

			How do I know?

			(beat)

			But, they all got that “witness for the prosecution” look to me. It’s probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted…I dunno.

			MAX

			That’s the reason?

			VINCENT

			That’s the “why.” There is no reason.

			(beat)

			No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.

			MAX

			Then what are you?

			VINCENT

			(looks up)

			…indifferent.

			Vincent looks out the window.

			VINCENT (CONT’D)

			C’mon, man. Get with it. Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one. In a blink…that’s us. Lost in space. The universe don’t care about you. The cop, you, me?

			(beat)

			Who notices?

			MAX

			How much they pay you? They pay you a lot?

			VINCENT

			Yeah.

			MAX

			What do you do afterwards?

			VINCENT

			After what?

			MAX

			When enough’s enough. When you got enough money. What do you do then?

			VINCENT

			Make that light.

			MAX

			You got a plan? You got like an exit strategy, don’t you?

			Vincent has no game plan. There is no objective towards which his life is moving. He is a subject in meaningless motion.

			MAX (CONT’D)

			Or you doin’ the same thing again and again, pointlessly. ’Cause you’re damaged goods? When you wake up in the morning? Open your eyes in the a.m., is there anybody there? Anybody home?

			VINCENT

			No, I just put on a happy face and go on with my day.

			MAX

			’Cause I think you are low. I think you are really low, my brother, and some standard parts that are supposed to be there in people…with you, aren’t. So what happened to you, man? And why haven’t you killed me?

			VINCENT

			Of all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max. Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth…

			MAX

			Answer the question.

			VINCENT

			Look in the mirror

			(on the attack)

			…with your paper towels…a clean cab…your own limo company someday. How much you got saved?

			MAX

			None of your business.

			VINCENT

			Someday? “Someday my dream will come…?”

			(beat)

			But one night you will wake up and discover it all turned around on you. Suddenly you are old. And it didn’t happen. It never will. ’Cause you were never going to do it, anyway. The dream became yesterday and got lost. Then you’ll bullshit yourself, it could never have been. And you’ll push it into memory…and zone out in a Barcalounger with daytime TV on for the rest of your life…

			(beat)

			VINCENT (CONT’D)

			Don’t talk to me about murder. You’re killing yourself in this cab. Bit by bit. Every day.

			Max is soaking up every word.

			VINCENT (CONT’D)

			All it ever took was a down payment. On a Lincoln Town Car. What the hell are you still doing in a cab? Or that girl. You can’t even call that girl [referring to Annie—Jada Pinkett Smith—whom Max met in the beginning of the story].

			The needle on the speedometer is creeping past forty…

			MAX

			’Cause I never straightened up and looked at it, you know…?

			VINCENT

			Slow down.

			MAX

			(ignoring him)

			…myself, I should have. My brothers did…

			(beat)

			Tried to gamble my way out from under. Another born-to-lose deal! Then, “It’s gotta be perfect to go!” You know? Risk all torqued-down. I coulda done it anytime…

			Needle pushing sixty…

			VINCENT

			Red light.

			MAX

			But you know what? It doesn’t matter. What’s it matter, anyway? ’Cause we are…insignificant out here in this big-ass nowhere. Twilight Zone shit. Says the badass sociopath in my backseat. So that’s one thing I got to thank you for, bro…Until now, I never saw it that way…

			The cab goes blasting through an intersection on a red light. A LOS ANGELES TIMES DELIVERY TRUCK SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES as Max swerves, barely avoiding a collision.

			VINCENT

			That was a red light!

			Max glances in the rearview.

			MAX

			…not until now. So what’s it all matter? It don’t. So, fuck it. Fix it. Nothing to lose. Right?

			Vincent’s H+K’s aimed at Max’s head. Max almost laughs.

			VINCENT

			Slow the hell down!

			MAX

			Why? What are you gonna do? Pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot…my ass.

			VINCENT

			Slow down!

			MAX

			Vincent?

			Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror. Vincent is arrested by a look in Max that he’s not seen before. It’s the even, confrontational look of a man with nothing to lose.

			MAX (CONT’D)

			Go fuck yourself.

			Max slams on the brakes and cranks the steering wheel hard right…

			EXT. STREET—RIGHT WHEEL

			hits a low divider…rear end comes unstuck, rotating over the front right and flipping the cab into a violent roll onto its roof, spinning down the street, SMASHING off other cars, pieces falling off, spewing glass…and then settling upside down, revolving slowly to a creaking stop, anti-freeze spilling across the pavement.

			And then everything goes silent, motionless, still.

		—

		And then we’re into the aftermath. Wow! A virtual assault of words—explosive, fast, visually dynamic, and emotionally insightful; the dialogue is crisp, sharp, and carries us like lightning across the page. More than anything, it’s an epiphany for Max. It’s a grabber, in more ways than one.

		The scene starts in the aftermath of the shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. It begins surrounded in tension, like an echo of the chaotic shoot-out that preceded it. The strain inside the cab gradually picks up as the car increases speed and Max and Vincent go after each other. Max’s choices are few if he hopes to walk away from this nightmare alive.

		First, not only is it exciting, filled with friction and suspense, but it illustrates the true purpose of a scene: It moves the story forward as well as revealing information about the main character. It does this both physically and emotionally. During the scene, as Max and Vincent race toward downtown, layer after layer of character is stripped away to reveal their personal histories and divergent points of view. According to Vincent, we are insignificant here, a tiny speck in the galactic expanse of space. Basically, life is meaningless, with no design, no purpose. The scene is the Plot Point at the end of Act II and leads us into Act III, the Resolution. After the car crashes, the only question that remains is simple: Can Max walk away alive, and can he stop Vincent from fulfilling his fifth hit, who, he now learns, is Annie?

		The scene reveals character, as Vincent probes and bursts Max’s dream balloon. Up until now, as Vincent says, Max has lived in a dream, in a “someday” state; someday he’s going to fulfill his dream of starting Island Limousine; someday he’s going to meet the woman of his dreams; someday he’ll have it all and be fulfilled as a person. It’s a pretty big Someday. Vincent shows him that there is only now, today, this present moment, this point in time. Waiting for “someday” is, like striving for perfection, really just an excuse. “Someday” is a concept that, to quote my mentor, Jean Renoir, “exists only in the mind, not in reality.”

		What forces are working on these two characters as they engage in their personal duel? In the nightclub, the hit man, against all odds, has completed his fourth hit, and now Max is driving him toward number five. Once again, Max is virtually a prisoner, his choices few; either he finds some way to escape safely, Vincent kills him after the final hit is completed, or he manages to kill Vincent.

		You’ll notice that this scene is not a simply just another dialogue scene; Max and Vincent are in a speeding taxi, escaping from the frenetic shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. So there is an outside, external tension—the police, other cars, helicopters, traffic lights—that impedes their action and becomes a source of conflict, adding tension to the harsh verbal exchange between Max and Vincent.

		There’s another thing that’s revealed in this scene. In the beginning, Max was portrayed as something of a wimp, a man afraid to stand up to his boss, the cab dispatcher, a man who lives a “someday” dream pictured in a postcard. But he has been transformed, and finally stands up to and confronts his nemesis.

		This does not happen spontaneously but has been gradually built up to, step by step, from the beginning of the screenplay. It is Vincent who stands up to the dispatcher when he gives Max a bad time, and shows Max how to defend himself against his superior. Max gathers enough strength to throw Vincent’s briefcase onto the freeway, ruining it. Then he’s forced to confront the drug warlord, Felix, and walks out alive. Though some might say that these elements are too unbelievable to be taken seriously, to my mind, they work effectively. Now, prompted by Vincent’s prodding, Max has found enough courage to flip the cab, possibly killing himself and Vincent but at least stopping Vincent from completing his last hit of the evening.

		In short, this scene, set amid the fury and confusion of the speeding cab, allows us to watch Max’s transformation and ultimately leads to the conclusion of the film. Max has completed his character arc.

		It’s a marvelous scene.

		Do these same principles work with comedy? Comedy creates a situation, then lets people act and react to the situation and each other. In comedy, you can’t have your characters playing for laughs; they have to believe what they’re doing, otherwise it becomes forced and contrived, and therefore unfunny.

		Remember the scene at the outdoor restaurant in Annie Hall? Annie (Diane Keaton) tells Alvy (Woody Allen) that she just wants to be his “friend” and not continue their romantic relationship. Both are uncomfortable, and this adds tension to the scene by heightening the comedic overtones; when he leaves the restaurant he collides with several cars, then tears up his driver’s license in front of a policeman. Woody Allen utilizes the situation for maximum dramatic effectiveness.

		In the Italian film Divorce—Italian Style, a classic comedy with Marcello Mastroianni, only a thin line separates comedy from tragedy. But, after all, comedy and tragedy are two sides of the same coin. Mastroianni is married to a woman who makes enormous sexual demands on him, and he can’t cope with it—especially when he meets a voluptuous young cousin who’s crazy about him. He wants a divorce but, alas, the Church won’t recognize it. What’s an Italian man to do? The only way the Church will recognize the end of his marriage is for his wife to die. But she’s as healthy as a horse.

		So he decides to kill her. But under Italian law, the only way he can kill her with honor and get away with it is if she’s unfaithful; he has to be cuckolded. So he sets out to find a lover for his wife.

		That’s the situation!

		After many, many funny moments, she is unfaithful to him, and his Italian honor demands he take action. He tracks her and her lover to an island in the Aegean Sea and searches for them, gun in hand.

		The characters are caught within the web of circumstances and play their roles with exaggerated seriousness, and the result is film comedy at its best. For in comedy, Woody Allen says, “Acting funny is the worst thing you can do.”

		Comedy, like drama, depends on “real people in real situations.”

		When you set out to write a scene, find the purpose of the scene and root it in place and time. Then establish the context and determine the content, and find the elements or components within the scene to build it and make it work.

		Every scene, like a sequence, or an act, or an entire screenplay, has a definite beginning, middle, and end. If you break the components of the scene down into beginning, middle, and end, you can establish the bits and pieces of action that are visually effective. In Collateral, we saw the entire scene: the beginning, when Max and Vincent head downtown; the middle, when they exchange conversation; and the end, when Max steps on the gas and flips the car.

		You don’t always need to show the entire scene. You can choose to show a few parts from the beginning, or just the middle, or maybe only the end. Only rarely is a scene depicted in its entirety. William Goldman, who wrote Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President’s Men, among other films, once remarked that he doesn’t enter the action until the last possible moment—that is, just before the purpose of the scene is revealed.

		You, as writer, are completely in control of how you create your scenes to move your story forward. You choose what part of the scene you are going to show.

		 			Create a scene by creating a context, then establish the content. Find the purpose of the scene, then choose the place and time for the scene. Find the components or elements within the scene to create inner or outer conflict to generate drama. Drama, remember, is conflict; seek it out.

		Your story always moves forward, step by step, scene by scene, toward the resolution. Once you know what you’re doing, you’re ready for the next step—writing the sequence.

		The Sequence


		 			“Form follows structure; structure doesn’t follow form.”

			—I. M. Pei

			Architect





“Synergy” is the study of systems, the behavior of systems as a whole, independent of their working parts. R. Buckminster Fuller, the noted scientist and humanitarian, creator of the geodesic dome, stresses the concept of synergy as the relationship between the whole and its parts; that is, a system.

		The screenplay is comprised of a series of elements that can be compared to a system, a number of individually related parts arranged to form a unity, or whole: The solar system is composed of planets orbiting the sun; the circulatory system works in conjunction with all the organs of the body; a stereo system, either analog or digital, is made up of amplifier, preamp, tuner, CD/DVD player, cassette player, speakers, turntable, cartridge, needle, and/or other technology. Put together, arranged in a particular way, the system works as a whole; we don’t measure the individual components of the stereo system, we measure the system in terms of “sound,” “quality,” and “performance.”

		A screenplay is really a system of sorts, comprised of specific parts that are related and unified by action, character, and dramatic premise. We measure it, or evaluate it, in terms of how well it works or doesn’t work.

		The screenplay, as a system, is made up of specific elements: endings, beginnings, scenes, Plot Points, shots, special effects, locations, music, and sequences. Together, unified by the dramatic thrust of action and character, the story elements are arranged in a particular way and then revealed visually to create the totality known as the screenplay.

		As far as I’m concerned, the sequence is perhaps the most important element of the screenplay. A sequence is a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end. It is a unit, or block, of dramatic action unified by one single idea. It is the skeleton, or backbone, of your script and, like the nature of structure itself, holds everything together.

		Remember the War Admiral race sequence in Seabiscuit? It’s a lengthy sequence, leading up to the match race between War Admiral and Seabiscuit. It’s really a sequence within a sequence. It begins with the agreement by the owner of War Admiral, Samuel Riddle, to race his champion Thoroughbred against Seabiscuit. The Seabiscuit team journeys across the country, then arrives at Pimlico and watches War Admiral work out. The group is so impressed with his size and speed that they know Seabiscuit needs “an edge.” That’s the beginning of the sequence.

		The middle—the team members train Seabiscuit at night, away from the frenzy of media attention; they “borrow” a fire bell and familiarize the horse with breaking from the start at the sound of the bell. Shortly before the race is set to begin, Red (Tobey Maguire), the jockey, breaks his leg while doing a favor for an old friend, and another rider has to be found. Seabiscuit trains some more and Red, in the hospital, coaches George Woolf, the new rider, on Seabiscuit’s racing quirks.

		The end of this section is really a sequence within the sequence. It is the race itself, which is broken down into beginning, middle, and end.

		We could call it “The Race.” The beginning of the race sequence is the day of the race; the fans arrive, and excitement runs high as the infield fills up. We cut to the locker room as the team, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), jockey George Woolf (real-life jockey Gary Stevens), and Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) prepare for this incredible race and discuss their last-minute preparations.

		The middle is the actual race itself: The horses are led to the starting line, settle down, and the bell sounds. The race begins and we see how focused the national attention has become on these two horses running around the track: “The race was broadcast on NBC and businesses around America scheduled a half day of work so their employees could hear the call…,” the narrator tells us in voice-over. Writer-director Gary Ross even cuts away to stills of the people of Depression America huddled together, listening to their radios. That’s how important this race was to the people of the Depression. It’s even said that President Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped doing the business of the country to tune in to the race.

		The race itself is a dazzling display of cinematic style and suspense. Back and forth we go, the two horses head-to-head. Then Seabiscuit kicks into another gear and leaves the larger horse behind, and wins by more than five lengths. Joy abounds as people embrace, yelling and screaming. Red listens from his hospital bed as the sequence ends with Seabiscuit in the Winner’s Circle, surrounded by the owners and media.

		It’s an incredible sequence, and you can see that it has a definite beginning, middle, and end. The race sequence itself also has a beginning, middle, and end. That’s the value of a well-constructed sequence. It moves the story forward while revealing information about the characters.

		A sequence is a series of scenes connected by one single idea, usually expressed in a word or two: a wedding, a funeral; a chase; a race; an election; a reunion; an arrival or departure; a coronation; a bank holdup. The context of the sequence is the specific idea that can be expressed in a few words or less. The race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral, for example, is a unit, or block, of dramatic action; it is the context, the idea that holds the content in place, like an empty coffee cup holds coffee, tea, water, milk, juice, or whatever. Once we establish the context of the sequence, we build it with content, the specific details, or ingredients, needed to create the sequence.

		The sequence is a key part of the screenplay because it holds essential parts of the narrative action in place, much like a strand holds a diamond necklace in place. You can literally string or hang a series of scenes together to create chunks of dramatic action.

		Remember the wedding sequence that opened The Godfather? The final action sequence in Collateral as Vincent hunts Annie and Max tries to save her? The opening battle sequence in Cold Mountain, integrating two distinct time periods, time present and time past? The real estate sequence in American Beauty where Carolyn is determined that “I will sell this house today”? The opening sequence of The Royal Tenenbaums where we are introduced to the family? Or the final battle sequence from Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King?

		Remember The Matrix when Neo and Trinity rescue Morpheus? They arrive in the lobby of the building where he’s being held, blast their way inside, and run up to the floor where Agent Smith is holding Morpheus. They fight their way in, rescue Morpheus, then fight their way out and make their escape. Beginning, middle, and end, all designated and held in place by one word—“rescue.”

		It’s an important concept to understand in the writing of a screenplay. It is the organizational framework, the form, the foundation, one of the major building blocks of the screenplay.

		The contemporary screenplay, as practiced by such modern screenwriters as Alan Ball, Richard LaGravenese, Wes Anderson, Robert Towne, Steven Kloves, Frank Darabont, Ron Bass, James Cameron, Gary Ross, Stuart Beattie, to name just a few, might be defined as a series of sequences tied together, or connected, by the dramatic story line. Stanley Kubrick’s epic Barry Lyndon is a series of sequences; so is James Cameron’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

		Why is the sequence so important?

		Look at the paradigm:





		As already discussed, when you begin writing your screenplay, you need to know four things: the opening, the Plot Point at the end of Act I, the Plot Point at the end of Act II, and the ending. When you know what those four elements are, and have done the necessary preparation on action and character, then you’re ready to start writing.

		Sometimes, but not always, these four story points are sequences. You might open your film with a wedding sequence, as in The Godfather. You might use a sequence like Neo meeting Morpheus and choosing the Red Pill in The Matrix as the Plot Point at the end of Act I. You might want to write a sequence like Paul Thomas Anderson does in Magnolia, when nine characters, all in states of deep emotional stress, sing the lyrics of Aimee Mann’s song “Wise Up.” It’s a wonderful illustration of how inventive a sequence can be. You might use a dramatic sequence to end the film, like Gary Ross does in Seabiscuit, or resolve your script with the performance of a play, like Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson do in Rushmore.

		Sequences can be written any way you want; they are a creative, limitless context within which to paint your picture against the canvas of action. It should be noted that there are no specific number of sequences in a screenplay; you don’t need exactly twelve, eighteen, or twenty sequences to make up your script. Your story will tell you how many sequences you need. Frank Pierson conceived and wrote Dog Day Afternoon with just twelve sequences. He started off with four: the opening, the two Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II, and the ending. He added eight sequences throughout the narrative line and built that into a complete screenplay.

		Think about it!

		You can have as many or as few sequences as you want. There’s no rule about the number you need. All you need to know is the idea behind the sequence, the context; and then you can create a series of scenes, the content.

		Most action films are held together by a series of sequences that keep the story moving forward. The action genre is a significant staple of our film fare, and if you look at any film company’s production schedules for the upcoming year, you’ll see at least half of its production slate is devoted to the action film.

		Writing the action film, and the action sequence, is really an art unto itself. So many times I read screenplays whose pages are filled with nonstop action—in fact, there is so much action, with little or no characterization, that it becomes dull and repetitive. The reader and viewer become overwhelmed and numb from the onslaught of words and pictures. Sometimes you can have a good action script with strong individual action sequences, but the premise is weak and derivative of earlier films. It needs a “new look,” or a more interesting concept.

		Why? Because there are problems: with the plot, or the characters, or the action itself. Some writers have a natural ability to write action, and others are more comfortable writing character. It’s important to note that before you can write any kind of action film, or action sequence, you must understand what the action film is, what its essential nature is. Once I had a student who wrote a screenplay about a navy pilot sent on a mission to a foreign country to rescue a kidnapped scientist being held hostage. It’s a good premise, and there are several opportunities to create notable action sequences that keep the story moving forward at a fast pace. That’s what he did, and his entire screenplay was one action sequence after another; the story moved like lightning, but it didn’t work at all. Why? Because he didn’t create an interesting main character. And because he didn’t know his main character, most of the dialogue consisted of expository elements designed to keep the story moving forward. It didn’t work. We didn’t know anything about this person sent to rescue the scientist, who he was or where he came from; we had no idea about his thoughts or feelings, or the forces working on his life.

		This is not all that uncommon. When you’re writing an action screenplay, like The Bourne Supremacy or Collateral, the focus must be on action and character; the two must reside in and interact with each other. Otherwise there are going to be problems. What usually happens is that the action overpowers the story and diminishes the characters, resulting in a screenplay that, no matter how well written, is flat and uninteresting. There has to be an appropriate balance of peaks and valleys, places in the material where the reader and audience can pause and catch their collective breath.

		Writing an action sequence is a definite skill, and good action scripts are written with color, pacing, suspense, tension, and, in most cases, humor. The interchanges between Max and Vincent in Collateral were often humorous as well as insightful. Remember Bruce Willis’s character mumbling to himself in Die Hard (Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza) or the bus making that leap across the enormous freeway chasm in Speed (Graham Yost)? We remember good action films like Jurassic Park (David Koepp) or The Fugitive (David Twohy and Jeb Stuart) or The Hunt for Red October (Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart) by the uniqueness of their action and the characters who take part in that action. But we usually forget all the cool car chases and explosions that occupy the majority of action films that fill our theaters. They all look alike.

		The key to writing any action film lies in writing the action sequence. In an action film like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (James Cameron and William Wisher), one of the most influential films of the ’90s, everything is structured and anchored around six major action sequences. After the introduction of the Terminator, the T-1000, and John and Sarah, the first major sequence is where young John Connor is rescued by the Terminator; the second is when the Terminator and John break his mother out of prison; the third, the “rest period” at Enrique’s gas station where they load up with weapons; the fourth, Sarah’s attempt to kill Miles Dyson, creator of the microchip that makes the future Age of Machines possible; the fifth, the siege at Cyberdyne Systems; and the sixth sequence is their breakout and chase, winding up in the steel factory. The entire third act is literally one long nonstop action sequence.

		These six key sequences hold (the function of the structure) the entire story together, but within this structural framework James Cameron and William Wisher have created a dynamic and intriguing premise, as well as some interesting characters. That, along with the special effects, makes this a truly memorable action film. And let’s not forget the “rest period” at the abandoned gas station so we can “breathe” and learn more about the characters. Then we’re off and running again.

		What makes a good action film great? The electricity of the action sequences. Remember the chase scenes from Bullitt and The French Connection? Or the start of the cattle drive in Howard Hawks’s Red River? Or “the walk” at the end of The Wild Bunch? Or the last sequence of The Matrix? Or Butch and Sundance jumping into the river gorge after being relentlessly chased by the Super Posse in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? The list goes on and on.

		The key to writing a great action sequence is the way it’s designed. A sequence, remember, is a series of scenes connected by one single idea, with a definite beginning, middle, and end. As mentioned, a sequence is a complete entity, held together by one single idea: a chase sequence, wedding sequence, party sequence, fight sequence, love sequence, storm sequence.

		What’s nice about designing a sequence is that you can play with many different elements to make it catchy, exciting, dynamic. One of the things I like the most about Sam Peckinpah as a filmmaker is the way he designs his sequences in what I call “the contradiction of image.” Things we don’t expect begin to play upon and affect the central core of action. One of my favorite examples is the opening sequence of The Wild Bunch. It can be described simply: a holdup, or bank robbery. That’s the context.

		The script opens with the outlaws, led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), wearing soldier uniforms and riding into a small town. They pass a group of kids setting fire to a scorpion, a little visual aside about what’s to come.

		When the Wild Bunch rides into town, they pass a preacher standing underneath a tent, denouncing the evils of alcohol in an abbreviated Leviticus 10:9: “Do not drink wine or strong drink…least ye die…it biteth itself like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.” In almost every Peckinpah film, there is some kind of reference to the evils of alcohol. But of course, he never just throws in a scene like this; he includes it as an integral part of the action that erupts once the Temperance Parade begins.

		The stage description sets up Pike’s character immediately.

		Pike is a thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing—except the changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero—his values are not ours—he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life….

		Pike’s character reveals his sympathetic side immediately; as the group prepares to enter the bank, he inadvertently bumps into a little old lady and knocks her parcels to the ground. Everybody freezes, but with the decorum of a gentleman, Pike picks up the packages, extends his arm, and helps the lady across the street.

		The bank robbery does more than just set us up for an action sequence. Peckinpah sets up his characters and situations in order to illustrate his theme, which is “unchanged men in a changing land.” The relationship between the two main characters, Pike and Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), is established immediately. In the first scene we see they’ve ridden together, stood by each other, and fought each other; they have a history between them. They know that the days of robbing banks and railroads are “closing fast,” and they’re locked into a dead-end future where the only alternatives are death, prison, or living out a meager kind of existence in a small Mexican village.

		There are three separate elements in the opening sequence: the holdup, the Temperance Parade, and the scavenger bounty hunters waiting to ambush the Wild Bunch. On a roof across from the bank, the bounty hunters, led by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), have been waiting hours for the Wild Bunch to arrive. The sun is boiling and they’re hot and tired and ornery, but there are large rewards for the capture or killing of the Wild Bunch.

		All these elements are set up and established as the holdup begins to unfold. It’s only a matter of time before it all explodes into one kaleidoscopic action sequence.

		Integrating these different elements into an action sequence is what places Peckinpah head and shoulders above most other action directors. Inside the bank, Angel, one of the Bunch, notices sunlight on the roof reflecting off rifle barrels across the street. Pike and Dutch immediately know it’s an ambush, and using the Temperance Parade as a cover they make their break, joining the elderly marchers and children and band members. That’s when all hell breaks loose. The street becomes a confused melee as bandits run for their horses, bounty hunters open fire, and men, women, and children collide with each other, caught in the crossfire.

		It’s an extraordinary sequence that utilizes all the visual components to capture our attention and keep us glued to the edge of our seats. Sometimes, if a script does not seem to be working as well as it should, or you feel there’s a problem in terms of pacing, or things seem dull and boring, you might think about adding some kind of action sequence to keep the story moving and the tension taut. Sometimes you have to make some drastic creative choices to pump up the story line. If you do, you need to examine the material and see whether the proposed action will blend in with your original concept. The material has to be designed for and incorporated into your story line, then executed to the best of your ability. Often the easy way out—a car chase, or a kiss, or a shoot-out, or a murder attempt—draws attention to itself and therefore doesn’t work.

		David Koepp, who wrote Spider-Man, Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park, and The Lost World, to name just a few of his credits, says the key to writing a good action sequence is finding more ways to say that someone “runs.” “Action sequences use a lot of verbs,” he says. “Look at the possibilities: He runs to hide behind the rock. He races over to the rock. He scrambles over to the rock. He crawls frantically on his belly over to the rock…Things like that can drive me crazy. Hurries, trots, sprints, dives, leaps, jumps, barrels, slams. The word slams, that’ll appear a lot in an action script.”

		In an action scene, Koepp says, “The reader is sometimes forcing their eyes along because what’s tremendously entertaining to watch on film is not necessarily so thrilling to read. I think the challenge is to make that stuff fly by at the pace you would like it to fly by in the movie. So you’ve constantly got to find ways to make the action sequences readable and easy for the reader to picture in his mind.”

		So what’s the best way to write an action sequence?

		Design it; choreograph the action from the beginning, through the middle, and on to the end. Choose your words carefully when you’re writing. Action is not written with a lot of long and beautifully styled sentences. Writing an action sequence has got to be intense, visual. The reader must see the action as if he or she were seeing it on the screen. But if you write too little, and don’t flesh out the action as much as you should, the action line becomes thin and doesn’t carry the gripping intensity that you must have in a good action sequence. We’re dealing with moving images that you hope will keep people glued to the edge of their seats, filled with excitement, or fear, or great expectation, locked in that great “community of emotion” that unites everybody in a darkened movie theater. Just look at some of the great action sequences: the opening of Cold Mountain, the shoot-out in Act III in Witness, the action sequences in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the ending of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the final battle sequence in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the last act of Collateral, the train robbery and final shoot-out in The Wild Bunch. These are all action sequences that have been designed and choreographed with immense care and strict attention to detail.

		Here’s an example of an excellent action sequence; it’s lean, clean, and tight, totally effective, extremely visual, and not bogged down with details. This is a little piece out of Jurassic Park. The scene takes place on the island off Costa Rica just as it has been hit by a violent tropical storm, and an employee trying to smuggle out dinosaur embryos has shut down the security systems. The two remote-controlled electric cars, one carrying two children and the attorney Gennaro, the other the Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum characters, are stalled next to the massive electric fence that keeps the dinosaurs enclosed in their restricted area. The power is out all over the island, and the kids are scared. They wait nervously.

		 			Tim pulls off the goggles and looks at two clear plastic cups of water that sit in recessed holes on the dashboard. As he watches, the water in the glasses vibrates, making concentric circles—

			—then it stops—

			—and then it vibrates again. Rhythmically.

			Like from footsteps.

			BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

			Gennaro’s eyes snap open as he feels it too. He looks up at the rearview mirror.

			There is a security pass hanging from it that is bouncing slightly, swaying from side to side.

			As Gennaro watches, his image bounces too, vibrating in the rearview mirror.

			BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

			GENNARO

			(not entirely convinced)

			M-Maybe it’s the power trying to come back on.

			Tim jumps into the backseat and puts the night goggles on again. He turns and looks out the side window. He can see the area where the goat is tethered. Or was tethered. The chain is still there, but the goat is gone.

			BANG!

			They all jump, and Lex SCREAMS as something hits the Plexiglas sunroof of the Explorer, hard. They look up.

			It’s a disembodied goat leg.

			GENNARO

			Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

			When Tim whips around to look out the side window again his mouth opens wide but no sound comes out. Through the goggles he sees an animal claw, a huge one, gripping the cables of the “electrified” fence. He whips off his goggles and presses forward, against the window. He looks up, up, then cranes his head back farther, to look out the sunroof. Past the goat’s leg, he can see—

			Tyrannosaurus rex. It stands maybe twenty-five feet high, forty feet long from nose to tail, with an enormous, boxlike head that must be five feet long by itself. The remains of the goat are hanging out of the rex’s mouth. It tilts its head back and swallows the animal in one big gulp.



		Well, there it is…and it’s quite impressive. This is the beginning of the action sequence that will carry us through to the end of the film. We literally see the action as it unfolds, step by step, bit by bit. Notice how visual it is, and how short the sentences are, almost staccato in their presentation, and how much “white space” is on the page. This is the way a good action sequence should read.

		The reader and the characters experience the same thing at the same time. We are bonded together, “one on one,” so we can experience what the characters are experiencing.

		There is a definite beginning, middle, and end to the action. Each beat builds the action line, incident to incident.

		We open at the beginning, with the cups on the dashboard vibrating. We know something’s going on here, we just don’t know what. Look at how the writing of the sequence builds upon the fear and terror of the characters. “BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.” Relentlessly, each sound expands and heightens the moment, stimulating the antennae of our imaginations. The writing style, besides being visual, uses short, clipped words or phrases. No long, beautifully formed sentences here. And of course, Spielberg is a master at putting this kind of sequence on film. A perfect example is the opening sequence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

		So far everything remains unseen, which heightens the fear and causes us to expect the worst. The goat is another visual aid that amplifies the tension and pacing. Generally, a good action sequence builds slowly, image by image, word by word, setting things up, drawing us into the excitement as the action gets faster and faster. Good pacing allows the tension to build upon itself, no matter whether it’s a chase sequence, as in Speed, a thriller sequence, as in Seven, the killing of Harlan in Thelma & Louise, or the tense waiting period for the emergency action message to arrive in Crimson Tide.

		Notice after the goat has vanished and the chain is swinging freely, suddenly there’s a BANG! and we literally jump in our seats. Then we see the “disembodied goat leg.” That’s when the fear starts rising among the characters, and that’s when our palms begin sweating and our mouths become dry, waiting for and dreading what we know is coming…Tyrannosaurus rex.

		It’s very good writing. Sometimes writers will try to cover a weakness in character writing by inserting action sequences, thus avoiding having to characterize. Sometimes action sequences are written in such detail that any attempt to create a good reading experience is simply lost in the blanket of excess verbiage.

		Other times you may want to weave a narrative line through a sequence that illuminates the character. An excellent example is the “selling the house” sequence in American Beauty, in which Carolyn sets out to sell the house she is showing. What’s great about the sequence is that it has one single line of narrative action, selling the house, shown through a series of attempts, each driving the action of the sequence forward. Notice the conflict within the scene. As said many times before, all drama is conflict; without conflict you have no action; without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story. And without story, you have no screenplay.

		The sequence begins with Carolyn’s planting a “For Sale” sign on the front lawn in a middle-class neighborhood. As she unloads her car, she frowns and slams the trunk shut. Inside the house, she unzips to her slip and fiercely starts cleaning, repeating the mantra: “I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today….” She scrubs countertops in the kitchen, strides a stepladder to dust a ceiling fan, cleans glass doors overlooking the backyard pool area, vacuums the carpet, doing whatever needs to be done.

		That’s the beginning of the sequence. The middle starts as she swings open the front door with a glorious smile welcoming the first visitors of the day. “Welcome,” she says, “I’m Carolyn Burnham.” She shows a grim-faced couple the fireplace, leads another unsmiling couple into the kitchen, shows a different couple the bedroom, then shows two mannish women in their thirties the outdoor pool area. “The ad said this pool was ‘lagoon-like.’ There’s nothing ‘lagoon-like’ about it. Except for maybe the bugs,” one of the women says. “There’s not even any plants out here.” “I have an excellent landscape architect,” Carolyn replies, but the women aren’t even listening. “I mean, I think ‘lagoon,’ and I think waterfall, I think tropical,” the second woman comments sarcastically. “This is just a cement hole.” To which Carolyn responds, smiling, “I have some tiki torches in the garage.”

		Notice how the one line of action, showing the house, from living room to kitchen to bedroom to the outside, is a continuous line of action, but illustrated with four different couples, giving the impression that Carolyn has been showing the house the whole day. This single line of action, showing the house, is the subject of the sequence, the context; and the content changes from room to room, couple to couple. In effect, this could be labeled a “montage,” a series of shots strung together to bridge time, place, and action.

		The sequence concludes with Carolyn, at the end of the day, shutting the vertical blinds. Then, “standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard. ‘Stop it,’ she demands to herself. But the tears continue. She SLAPS herself again. ‘Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up!’ She SLAPS herself repeatedly until the crying stops. She stands there, taking deep, even breaths until she has everything under control. Then she finishes pulling the blinds shut, once again all business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.”

		Look what we know about her character from this particular sequence. She fails in her intention, “I will sell this house today”; we’ve seen her working her butt off doing the best job she can, but it’s still not good enough. She thinks she has failed, and failure, to her, is a sign of weakness. Then she pulls it all together, wipes the tears away, and strides out as if nothing had happened.

		But look at what we, the reader and audience, get to see: a woman with a low sense of self-esteem and little self-love, who takes failure personally and blames herself for what she is not able to accomplish.

		It’s brilliant. And it all comes from a sequence: a series of scenes connected by one single idea, with a definite beginning, middle, and end.

		Action and character, joined together, sharpens the focus of your screenplay and makes it both a better reading and a better viewing experience.

		The sequence is a major building block in laying out the story. The next step is building your screenplay.

		Building the Story Line


		 			GIOVANNI:

			 				“I believe now that I’m no longer capable of writing. It’s not that I don’t know what to write, but how to write it. That’s what they call a ‘crisis.’ But in my case it’s something inside me, something which is affecting my whole life.”

			—La Notte

			Michelangelo Antonioni





If we define a screenplay as a linear arrangement of related incidents, episodes, and events leading to a dramatic resolution, how do we go about building and constructing our story line? What’s the best way of combining all those thoughts and ideas and words and scenes, all those little snippets of dialogue that are running around inside our heads, to build a unified story line into our screenplay?

		How do we build our story line?

		Let’s start at the beginning. Remember, the definition of the verb structure is “to build something or put together something,” like a building or bridge. The definition of the noun is “the relationship between the parts and the whole.” Both apply to the task of building the story line.

		Up until now we’ve discussed the four basic elements that are needed to write a screenplay—ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. Before you can write the words Fade In, before you can put one word of screenplay down on paper, you need to know those four things.

		Now what?

		Take a look at the paradigm:





		What do you see? Act I, Act II, Act III. Beginning, middle, end. The beginning starts with the opening scene or sequence and goes until the Plot Point at the end of Act I. The middle starts at the end of Plot Point I and goes until Plot Point II. The end begins at the end of Plot Point II and continues to the end of the screenplay. Each act is a unit, or block, of dramatic action, held together with the dramatic context: Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution.

		Look at Act I:





		Act I is a unit of dramatic (or comedic) action that goes from the beginning of the screenplay to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. There is a beginning and an end point. Therefore, it is a whole, complete unto itself, even though Act I is a part of the whole (the screenplay). As a complete unit of action, there is a beginning of the beginning, a middle of the beginning, and an end of the beginning. It is a self-contained unit, approximately twenty to twenty-five pages long, depending on the screenplay. The end is Plot Point I: the incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction, in this case, Act II. The dramatic context, which holds the content in place, is the Set-Up. In this unit of dramatic action you set up your story—introduce the main character, establish the dramatic premise (what the story is about), and sketch in the dramatic situation, either visually or dramatically.

		Here’s what Act II looks like:





		Act II is also a whole, a complete, self-contained unit of dramatic (or comedic) action; it is the middle of your screenplay and contains the bulk of the action. It begins at the end of Plot Point I and continues through to the Plot Point at the end of Act II. So we have a beginning of the middle, a middle of the middle, and an end of the middle.

		It is approximately sixty pages long, and the Plot Point at the end of Act II occurs approximately between pages 80 and 90 and spins the action around into Act III. The dramatic context is Confrontation, and in this unit of dramatic action your character encounters obstacle after obstacle that keeps him/her from achieving his/her dramatic need. Once you determine the dramatic need of your character, what your character wants, you can create obstacles to that need, and then your story becomes your character’s overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need.

		Act III is the end, or Resolution, of your screenplay.





		Like Acts I and II, Act III is a whole, a self-contained unit of dramatic (or comedic) action. As such, there is a beginning of the end, a middle of the end, and an end of the end. It is approximately twenty to thirty pages long, and the dramatic context is Resolution. Resolution, remember, means “solution,” and refers not to the specific scenes or shots that end your screenplay, but to what resolves the story line.

		In each act, you start from the beginning of the act and move toward the Plot Point at the end of the act. That means each act has a direction, a line of development that begins at the beginning and ends at the Plot Point. The Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II are your destination points; that’s where you’re going as you’re building or constructing your screenplay.

		You build your screenplay in terms of individual units of action—Act I, II, III.

		How do you build your storyline?

		By using 3 × 5 cards.

		Take a pack of 3 × 5 cards. Write the idea of each scene or sequence on a single card, and a few brief words of description (no more than five or six) to aid you while you’re writing. You need fourteen cards per thirty pages of screenplay. More than fourteen means you probably have too much material for Act I; less than fourteen means you may be too thin and need to add a few more scenes to fill out the Set-Up.

		For example, if we wanted to structure Act I of Thelma & Louise, here’s what it would look like on the cards. Card 1, Louise is at work; Card 2, Louise calls Thelma; Card 3, Thelma is with Darryl, doesn’t ask him about his trip; Card 4, Thelma and Louise pack; Card 5, Louise picks up Thelma; Card 6, they drive to the mountains; Card 7, Thelma wants to stop; Card 8, they’re at the Silver Bullet for drinks and eats; Card 9, Harlan hustles Thelma; Card 10, they drink, talk; Card 11, Harlan and Thelma dance, she feels sick; Card 12, Harlan takes Thelma outside; Card 13, Harlan attempts to rape Thelma; Card 14, Louise kills Harlan.

		This is a simple summary of the action, and not the way the screenplay will look, but it is a process that lays out the story line; it is an effective way in which you can build, or put together, your story.

		Understand that building the screenplay is different from writing the screenplay. They are two different processes. That’s why I say that one card equals one scene, even though it’s a contradiction when you’re writing the screenplay.

		For example, look at the sequence during which Max visits his mother in the hospital in Collateral. When you’re building your story line on the cards you may write, “Max visits mother in hospital.” Yet, though we write it on one card, in truth, when we write the screenplay, it might be an entire sequence, a series of scenes connected by one single idea. If you look at the film, “Max visiting his mother” is written as a sequence: Max and Vincent arrive at the hospital; Max visits with his mother, Vincent sweet-talks his mother; Max escapes with Vincent’s bag; Vincent chases him; Vincent confronts him; Max, defiant, throws the bag over the freeway. That’s approximately seven scenes (it’s longer in the movie), and it all comes from “Max visiting his mother.”

		Suppose your character is feeling chest pains, and the story leads him/her to the hospital. On one card you write “Goes to the hospital.” But when you’re actually writing this card for the screenplay, it may become an entire sequence, as in Collateral: Your character would arrive at the hospital; the doctors examine him; the lab work is done; various medical tests, like X-rays, an EKG, or an EEG, are conducted; a family member or friend is with him. He may be put in a room, or ward, and he may dislike the admitting physician; the doctors might discuss the case with relatives; your character might be even be placed in the intensive care unit. All this can be specified in a few words on the card: “Goes to the hospital.”

		One scene per card, even though that will probably be a contradiction when you’re writing the screenplay. As my mentor, Jean Renoir, used to say: “Do I contradict myself? Then I contradict myself.” It’s very important to remember that when you’re doing the cards, you’re doing the cards. When you’re writing the screenplay, you’re writing the screenplay. One’s an apple, the other’s an orange.

		Building the story line can be done easily and effectively with cards. You can use as many cards as you like: Edward Anhalt, who adapted The Young Lions and Becket, used fifty-two cards to build his screenplays. Why fifty-two? Because that’s how many cards there were in one package. Tina Fey used fifty-six cards when she wrote Mean Girls; Ernest Lehman, who wrote North by Northwest, The Sound of Music, and Family Plot, used anywhere from fifty to a hundred cards; Frank Pierson wrote Dog Day Afternoon in twelve cards—he simply wove the story around twelve basic sequences.

		I suggest using fourteen cards per approximately thirty pages of screenplay. That means fourteen cards for Act I, fourteen cards for the First Half of Act II, fourteen cards for the Second Half of Act II, and fourteen cards for Act III. Why fourteen? Because it works. Over the years, teaching thousands of students, both here and abroad, I have found I can tell whether a writer has too much material for Act I based on how many cards he/she lays out—strange, but true. If a writer has fifteen or sixteen cards, I can tell immediately that it’s top-heavy; there’s too much material for the act. If there are twelve or thirteen cards, I can tell the material is thin, and the writer needs a few more scenes to flesh it out in terms of character and plot, depth and dimension. Sometimes writers will use eleven or twelve cards and then tell me that they’ll add a few more scenes when they’re writing the script. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn’t.

		It’s just one of those odd things I’ve discovered out of my experience of teaching and writing screenplays; the cards really become a sort of “psychic” guide to laying out the scenes and sequences you’ll need to build your story line. Sometimes I’ll use different-colored cards: blue for Act I, green for Act II, and yellow for Act III.

		The cards are an incredible method. You have absolute freedom to change, add, or delete. You can arrange or rearrange them, any way you want, adding some, omitting others. It is simple, easy, and effective and gives you maximum mobility in building your screenplay.

		Sometimes people want to write down their scenes in outline form on the computer. You know: 1, 2, 3, 4…This does work, but I personally find it very restricting; it’s too hard to move scenes around or rearrange them in a different order if you get a sudden idea. Final Draft screenwriting software, in versions 6 and 7, has created a scene card application that lets you write down a card, then rearrange it any way you want. However, I still like the feel of shuffling the cards around; I find it easier to have the cards in my hands so I can arrange and rearrange them at will. But do whatever works for you.

		When you first lay down your story line, I suggest you simply write down all those scenes you know you want included in the script. (There’s more about this in The Screenwriter’s Workbook.) Just scribble a few words that will identify the scene and throw them down in no real order, free-association style. You already know your beginning and Plot Point I: Cards 1 and 14. That means you already have two cards, the beginning point and the end point. All you need are twelve more to lay out the action line of Act I.

		Let’s do an exercise of building a story line by creating the dramatic context of each act and then determining the content.

		Earlier on I mentioned Newton’s Third Law of Motion: “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction”; such a simple understanding about the physical nature of things, yet it took more than six hundred years to achieve that understanding. The principle also works in building a screenplay. First, you must know the dramatic need of your main character. What does your main character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay? This can apply to each scene as well. Once you establish your character’s dramatic need, then you can create obstacles to that need.

		I’ll say it once again: All drama is conflict. Without conflict, you have no action. Without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story. And without story, you ain’t got no screenplay.

		The essence of character is action—action is character. Film is behavior, right; what a person does, and not necessarily what he/she says, is who he/she is.

		We live in a world of action-reaction. If you’re driving a car (action) and someone cuts you off or cuts in front of you, what do you do (reaction)? Swear, usually. Honk your horn indignantly. Try to cut the other driver off, tailgate him. Shake your fist, mutter to yourself, step on the gas! It’s all a reaction to the action of the other driver’s cutting you off. Action-reaction—it’s a law of the universe. If your character acts in your screenplay, somebody, or something, is going to react in such a way that your character then reacts—thus creating a new action that will create another reaction.

		Your character acts, and somebody reacts. Action-reaction, reaction-action—your story always moves toward that Plot Point at the end of each act.

		Many aspiring and inexperienced screenwriters seem to have things happen to their characters, and as a result, the characters are always reacting to their situations, rather than acting in terms of dramatic need. When this happens, the main character seems to disappear off the page. It becomes a major problem in the screenwriting process. The essence of character is action; your character must act, not merely react. Again, what a person does, and not what he/she says, is who he/she is. This needs to be established, immediately, from page one, word one.

		A good case in point is The Bourne Supremacy, where Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is constantly reacting to someone’s trying to kill him. He doesn’t know who or why. He reacts to the attacks, then attacks, so he is reactive before he becomes active. The same kind of situation is present in The Manchurian Candidate (Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris), where Denzel Washington reacts to the inciting incident, the ambush that opens the film. Later, when he starts having a recurrent dream, he is reacting; that’s what prompts him to go in search of what’s happening to him and the others in his squad: his dramatic need. Now he becomes active. He’s doing something. In Three Days of the Condor (Lorenzo Semple and David Rayfiel), Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is a reader for a CIA cell in Manhattan. Act I sets up his office routine. On this particular day, it is Turner’s turn to get lunch for his fellow coworkers. It’s starting to rain, so he ducks out the back door, through the streets and alley, to the restaurant. When he returns from lunch, everyone is dead—murdered. That is the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Turner reacts: He calls the CIA; he is told to avoid all the places where he’s known, especially home. He finds a coworker who hadn’t come in to work dead in bed, and doesn’t know where to go or whom to trust. He is reacting to the situation. He acts when he phones Higgins (Cliff Robertson) and tells him he wants his friend Sam (Walter McGinn) to meet him and bring him into headquarters. The meeting goes awry, and Sam is shot. That failing, Turner acts by kidnapping Kathy (Faye Dunaway) at gunpoint and forcing her to take him to her apartment: He’s got to rest, collect his thoughts, find out what action to take.

		Action is doing something; reacting is having it happen to them.

		In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy is convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sent to Shawshank Penitentiary for two life sentences, back to back. When he arrives, he must learn to adapt to the prison hierarchy. On his first night inside the cell, another convict reacts to his situation by breaking down and crying, bemoaning his innocence. He is yanked out of his cell and beaten mercilessly by the prison guards. He dies. He has acted, and the result is that he loses his life.

		A short time later, Andy is in the showers, and a group labeled “the sisters” makes a pass at him. Andy declines their advances. From that moment on, Andy is a target. He is beaten and raped mercilessly and, while he defends himself as best he can, he says nothing; he simply reacts to the situation.

		He doesn’t do or say anything until Plot Point I. That’s when he approaches Red, saying, “I hear you’re a man who can get things done.” It’s the first time he’s spoken out—taken action. Based on this conversation, the two form a bond, and a mutual support system is now in place.

		Action, reaction—two different sides of the same coin.

		A good screenplay is set up from page one, word one. Act I is a unit of action in which the major elements of the story need to be carefully integrated and established; the incidents and events in this unit of action must lead directly to the Plot Point at the end of Act I, which is the true beginning of your story.

		If the script is not set up correctly, there is a certain tendency to keep adding characters and events to the story line to make it move faster. I recently read a script where there were fifteen characters introduced within the first ten pages of the screenplay. I didn’t know who or what the story was about. The story seemed to skate on the surface of the action without penetrating its layers of texture and depth, making it seem trite, contrived, and predictable.

		Why does this happen? As I’ve learned through my travels and teaching, it seems many writers approach their screenplays without doing enough preparation; they’re so anxious to begin writing the script that they don’t take the time to explore and develop the relationships between the actions and characters. So they begin from the smallest kernel of information and then feel their way through Act I. They seem to spend most of their time trying to figure out what their story is really about and what happens next, so they throw down as many story points as they can in the first act, hoping the story will manifest itself.

		It doesn’t work. The seeds may be planted, but they are not cultivated, watered, or nourished. The writer tells his or her story in the first ten pages, then is lost and doesn’t know what to do next.

		Preparation and research are essential to the screenwriting process. It is the responsibility of the screenwriter to know and clearly define who the main character is, what the dramatic premise is (what the story is about), and what the dramatic situation is (the circumstances surrounding the action). If you don’t know your story well enough, if you haven’t spent enough time doing the required research, then you run the risk of inserting incidents and events into the story line just to try to make it work, and then the narrative thread of the story usually goes awry; the stuff just isn’t working.

		Sometimes a problem exists because the story line is too thin, and more plot has to be found, but the solution is not creating more characters or interesting incidents to put into the screenplay. Creating more events, or more obstacles to confront, is not the answer; it doesn’t do anything except expand the problem.

		The trouble is often traceable to a writer’s impulse to get the script off to a fast and provocative start. If you’ve only got ten pages to grab the attention of the reader or audience, then the tendency is to lump all of the characters, their obstacles, and their relationships with other characters into this ten-page unit of dramatic action.

		It’s too much, too soon. More is not necessarily better. If you take great screenplays like The Shawshank Redemption, Lord of the Rings, Seabiscuit, American Beauty, Y Tu Mamá También, Thelma & Louise, and The Silence of the Lambs, all the major ingredients of the story line are set up and either in place or referred to within the first ten-page unit of dramatic action. The dramatic elements are simple and direct. That’s why the context of Act I is the Set-Up.

		The Shawshank Redemption deals with Andy’s life in prison, and in the opening sequence, the inciting incident, we set up the murder of Andy’s wife and lover, as well as his trial and verdict, before he enters the prison. We have to know why he’s sent there and what crime he has committed. The three threads of the story line—murder, trial, and verdict—are brilliantly intercut, so we see the events leading to his conviction, even though we never actually see him committing the murders.

		Many screenwriters might approach a story like this from the perspective of dialogue; they might begin with Andy entering the prison, and then have him, during his relationship with Red, tell his story in bits and pieces. As Red informs us in voice-over, Andy doesn’t seem to belong in the prison population; when he walks “he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or worry.” During their first few scenes together, Andy could explain to Red the circumstances surrounding the murder of his wife. In terms of setting up the story, this approach might work, but the tendency might be to explain rather than reveal.

		In Apollo 13 (William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert), the first ten pages set up all the narrative threads that are needed to establish the situation. After showing newsreel shots of the fire that killed the three astronauts of Apollo 1, the script opens with a friendly party-like gathering where people are watching Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon. In just a few words we learn that these people are astronauts in the current NASA program and that the dream of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is to land on the moon. In just a few pages we know everything we need to know, including the suspicion that Lovell’s wife has some deep fear about his going into space again.

		The inciting incident occurs on page 10, when Lovell returns home and surprises his family with the news that his space mission will take place sooner than originally scheduled. (Originally, a scene had been written showing Lovell with the NASA officials getting the assignment, but it slowed everything down so it was cut.)

		Once he gets the assignment, the next ten pages focus on his training and preparation for the mission, so we can see what the real-life astronauts had to go through to prepare for their flight. Plot Point I is the liftoff into space.

		Apollo 13 is an excellent example of classic screenwriting that sets up character and story from page one, word one, both through action and dialogue. The script could easily have started with Lovell and his crews being informed their mission was being pushed up, and if it had been written that way, most of the expository information would have to have been established within the first ten-page unit of the dramatic action.

		In Sense and Sensibility (Emma Thompson), based on Jane Austen’s nineteenth-century novel, it would have been very easy to put in too much too soon. In the first few pages we could have set up the backstory, the relationships within the Dashwood family, the death of the father, and how it affects the three sisters, but this normally would be too much information for Act I. Nevertheless, it’s got to be there for us to set up the story correctly.

		How did Emma Thompson handle this? In voice-over we hear about the family, see the father on his deathbed, and learn that the family fortune is to be automatically inherited by the son. And he promises his dying father that he will take care of his three sisters. But after the funeral, we see that the son’s wife has other plans for her husband’s inheritance.

		That’s a lot of information to present in the first ten pages. But it’s been set up in both narration and pictures, so we see that the father’s widow and his three daughters are literally without a roof over their heads. The rest of Act I deals with how the family is going to cope with this situation, and we see them play it out in scene after scene. The girls have to be married, of course, for in those days women needed husbands to take care of them. When a possible match between Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Edward (Hugh Grant) doesn’t happen, the girls give up the house to their brother and move to the country. Plot Point I.

		If all this backstory information had been executed through dialogue, there would have been way too much explanation in the story. It would have been too wordy, the characters passive and reactive, the scenes too long and expository, with the result that the narrative action would not move the story forward.

		Build the story line in units of dramatic action. Start with Act I. As a complete unit of dramatic action, the story begins with the opening scene or sequence and ends at the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Let’s create a story about Colin, who is falsely accused of embezzling more than a million dollars from his Wall Street company through an ingenious computer scam. During the screenplay, he seeks and finds the true culprit and brings him/her to justice.

		Take the 3 × 5 cards. Write down a few words or descriptive phrases on each card. On the first card we want to create the inciting incident, so on Card 1 we write “special effects computer sequence.” This is where and how the scam is occurring. Next, Card 2, “Colin going to work.” Card 3, “Colin arrives at office.” Card 4, “Colin at work.” Card 5, “big stock deal in the works.” Card 6, “Colin meets with client.” Card 7, “Colin with wife/girlfriend at play or party.” Card 8, “office—embezzlement of $1 million discovered.” Card 9, “emergency meeting of top executives.” Card 10, “police investigate.” Card 11, “the media learns about it.” Card 12, “Colin nervous; embezzlement discovered in his account.” What happens next? Card 13, “Colin questioned by police.” Then what happens? Card 14, Plot Point I, “Colin arrested for embezzlement.”

		Step by step, scene by scene, build your story from the beginning to the Plot Point at the end of the act: “Colin arrested for embezzlement.” It’s like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

		In the fourteen cards you’ve indicated the flow of dramatic action in Act I through the end of Plot Point I. When you’ve completed the cards for Act I, take a look at what you’ve got. Go over the cards, scene by scene, like flash cards. Do it several times. Soon you’ll pick up a definite flow of action; you’ll change a few words here and a few words there to make it read easier. Get used to the story line. Tell yourself the story of the first act, the Set-Up.

		If you throw down the cards and end up with a few too many, don’t worry about it. Rather, see if you can consolidate the action of a few cards into one card; that way, you’ll be able to bridge the incidents of the story line into a cohesive whole. Don’t be afraid to play around with the cards. You may want to try them in a different order until they feel right. You’re not tied to the order; arrange and rearrange them to suit your needs. The cards are for you. Use them to construct your story, so you always know where you’re going. Don’t worry about the writing—just focus on the organization and flow of the story.

		When you’ve completed the cards for Act I, put them on a bulletin board, on the wall, or on the floor, in sequential order. Tell yourself the story from the beginning to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Do it over and over again, and pretty soon you’ll begin to weave the story into the fabric of the creative process.

		Do the same with Act II. Remember that the dramatic context of Act II is Confrontation. Is your character moving through the story with his/her dramatic need firmly established? You must keep the character’s obstacles in mind all the time in order to generate dramatic conflict.

		When you’ve finished the cards, repeat the process from Act I; go through the cards from the beginning of Act II to the Plot Point at the end of Act II. Free-associate, let ideas come to you, put them on cards, and go over and over them.

		Use fourteen cards to get from the beginning of Act II to a possible Mid-Point of the story. The Mid-Point is a story progression point, an incident, episode, or event, that occurs around page 60. It could be a scene or sequence, a major event, or an understanding or line of dialogue. Its function is to move the story forward (there’s more about this in The Screenwriter’s Workbook). Then do another fourteen cards that take you from the Mid-Point to the Plot Point at the end of Act II. Then you can resolve the story line with fourteen cards in Act III. Let the story line guide you.

		Lay the cards out. Study them. Plot your story progression. See how it’s working. Don’t be afraid to change anything. A film editor I once interviewed provided me with an important creative principle; he said that within the context of the story, “The things you try that don’t work will always tell you what does work.”

		It’s a classic rule in film. Many of the best cinematic moments happen by accident. A scene tried that doesn’t work when first tried will ultimately tell you what does work.

		Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.

		How long should you spend on the cards?

		A few days, not more than a week. It takes me a couple of days to lay out the cards. I spend a day or so on Act I, about four hours. I spend a day on Act II and III.

		Then I’ll put them on the floor or bulletin board and I’m ready to start working. I’ll spend several days going over and over the cards, getting to know the story, the progression, the characters, until I feel comfortable. That means about two to four hours a day spent with the cards. I’ll go through the story, act by act, scene by scene, shuffling cards around, trying something here, moving a scene from Act I into Act II, a scene from Act II into Act I. The card method is so flexible you can do anything you want, and it works!

		The card system allows you maximum mobility in structuring your screenplay. Go over and over the cards until you feel ready to begin writing. How do you know when to start writing? You’ll know; it’s a feeling you get. When you’re ready to start writing, you’ll start writing. You’ll feel secure with your story; you’ll know what you need to do, and you’ll start getting visual images of certain scenes.

		Is the card system the only way to construct your story?

		No. There are several ways to do it. Some writers simply list a series of scenes on the computer, numbering them (1) Bill at the office; (2) Bill with John at bar; (3) Bill sees Jane; (4) Bill leaves for party; (5) Bill meets Jane; (6) Bill and Jane like each other, decide to leave together. As mentioned earlier on, I don’t recommend this method, because you have less freedom to arrange and rearrange scenes.

		Another way is to write a treatment—a narrative synopsis of what happens in your story, incorporating a little dialogue. A treatment can be anywhere from four to twenty pages long. An outline is also used, especially in television, where you tell your story in scenes in a detailed narrative plot progression. Dialogue is an essential part of the outline, which can be anywhere from twenty-eight to sixty pages in length, depending on the show you’re writing for, be it a sitcom, an hour episodic series, or a Movie of the Week (a form that has been temporarily shelved, at least at this writing). That may change in the normal cycle of things. Outlines, or treatments, should not be longer than thirty pages. Do you know why?

		The producer’s lips get tired.

		That’s an old Hollywood joke, but there’s a great deal of truth to it.

		No matter what method you use, you are now ready to move from telling the story on cards to writing the story into your screenplay.

		You know your story from start to finish. It should move smoothly from beginning to end, with story progressions clearly in mind so all you have to do is look at the cards, close your eyes, and see the story unfolding.

		Now all you’ve got to do is write it!

		—

		Determine your ending, opening, and Plot Point at the end of Acts I and II. Get some 3 × 5 cards, different colors if you choose, and start with the opening of your screenplay. Free-associate. Whatever comes to mind for a scene, put it down on the cards. Build toward the Plot Point at the end of the act.

		Experiment with it. The cards are for you—find your own method to make them work for your story.

		Do it.

		Screenplay Form


		 			“Sometimes, the laws of Nature are so simple, we have to rise above the complexity of scientific thought to see them.”

			—Richard Feynman

			Nobel Prize–winning physicist





Several years ago, I was conducting one of my seven-week screenwriting workshops, and one of the participants was a prominent television news reporter for the NBC Evening News. A graduate of NYU, he had an advanced journalism degree from Stanford and had worked his way up the corporate ladder to become skilled and proficient in his chosen career. He had come to me, he said, because he wanted to turn his journalism skills into a screenwriting career. He had many stories, he went on, several of which had already made it onto the national news scene, and he was confident his scripts would be successful and profitable. It seemed like he had it all figured out: He would write the screenplay, use his contacts in the industry to get the script to the “right people” (whoever they were), sell it for a lot of money, and…well, I guess we all know the rest. The Hollywood dream.

		Everybody wants to be a screenwriter.

		During the first few weeks it became very clear to me that he was extremely talented, that he worked hard, and that he was disciplined. And yes, he had a good idea that would make a good screenplay if executed properly.

		And there’s the rub: “executed properly.”

		He wanted to write a screenplay, but he wanted to write it on his terms; he wanted to do it his way, not the way it’s done professionally in the industry today.

		Because he was a professional newsperson, he was determined to write in the form he knew best and was most comfortable with. He wanted to write it in “news format,” which meant the scene descriptions and commentary would be on the left-hand margin of the page and the visual description and cues on the right. He placed his dialogue on the left-hand margin, the way playwrights do. Obviously, that’s not proper screenplay form; it may be right in the news media, but it’s not in the film industry.

		When he turned in his first pages, I knew he had a major problem. He wasn’t capturing the dimension, either visually or emotionally, on the page. The format got in the way. I suggested he should go back to the beginning and put his story in proper screenplay form. He declined, saying it would get in the way of his telling the story the way he wanted to tell it. I didn’t say anything, figuring he would learn the lesson for himself. So, he kept writing in news form, and I kept telling him he was going to have a problem translating what he had written into proper screenplay form. I could tell he didn’t believe me; there would be no difficulty, he said adamantly, in transferring his pages into the proper screenplay form. I looked at him, he looked at me, and in that instant I knew his dream was going to collide with the realities of Hollywood. So, as an exercise, after he had completed the first act, I asked him to transfer what he had written into proper screenplay form. He had to do it sometime, I told him, so he might as well do it now.

		I didn’t hear from him for several days, and then I got a call telling me he’d gotten a new assignment that would take him out of town. During our conversation, I asked how he was doing and if he was having any problems, trying to encourage and support him in any way I could. He paused, hesitated, stumbled around, and I knew he had perceived the truth. Screenplays have a specific form, and if you ignore that form, thinking that at some point down the line you’re going to change it into the correct form, it’s not going to serve you or the story, and especially not the screenplay. After all, screenplay form is screenplay form, just like rocks are hard and water’s wet.

		I didn’t hear from him during the next week, but at the following class session, he showed me his pages. I could see he had some doubts and reservations in letting me read the pages, and after I had looked them over, I could see why. There was no narrative line of action; it was episodic, and his visuals were somewhat dull and boring. It didn’t work at all, and he knew it. He knew what he wanted to write, he just didn’t know how to do it. It was a washout. Screenplay form had gotten in the way of his ability to tell his story the way he wanted to tell it. That was it for him. He never came back, and to this day I don’t know if he ever completed that screenplay or not.

		So, what’s the moral of the story? If you want to do it, do it right. He wanted to write a screenplay, but refused to learn the proper form. Screenplay form is unique and precise. It’s so simple it’s difficult. Why?

		Look at some of the common assumptions that are so prevalent. The first and most common is that when you’re writing a screenplay, it is the writer’s responsibility (read: “your” responsibility) to write in the camera instructions so the director and others can see how it should be filmed.

		Wrong.

		The writer’s job is to write the screenplay and keep the reader turning pages, not to determine how a scene or sequence should be filmed. You don’t have to tell the director and cinematographer and film editor how to do their jobs. Your job is to write the screenplay, to give them enough visual information so they can bring those words on the page into life, in full “sound and fury,” revealing strong visual and dramatic action, with clarity, insight, and emotion.

		Don’t give the reader an excuse not to read your screenplay.

		That’s what the screenplay form is all about—what is a professional screenplay, and what isn’t. As a reader, I’m always looking for an excuse not to read a script. So when I find a screenplay with improper form, I make a determination: An aspiring writer, a novice, wrote this. The first lesson is simple: You can’t sell a script in Hollywood without the help of readers; don’t give them a reason not to take you seriously.

		Everybody, it seems, has his/her own conception about what is, and what is not, screenplay form. Some people say if you’re writing a screenplay you’re “obligated” to write in camera angles; and if you ask them why, they’ll mumble something about “so the director knows what to film!” They’ll create an elaborate and meaningless exercise called “writing in camera angles.” And soon, an abundance of camera angles—like long shots, close shots, various instructions about zooms, pans, and dollies—pepper the pages, revealing a novice screenwriter who doesn’t know what he or she is doing.

		There was a time, in the 1920s and ’30s, when the director’s only job was to direct the actors, and it was the writer’s job to write in camera angles for the cameraman. That’s no longer true. It’s not the job of the screenwriter.

		F. Scott Fitzgerald is a perfect example. One of the most gifted novelists of the twentieth century, Fitzgerald came to Hollywood to write screenplays. He failed miserably—he tried to “learn” camera angles and the intricate technology of film, and he let that get in the way of his screenwriting. Not one script he worked on was made without extensive rewriting. His only screenwriting achievement is unfinished, a script called Infidelity written for Joan Crawford in the 1930s. It’s a beautiful script, patterned like a visual fugue, but the third act is incomplete and it lies gathering dust in the studio vaults.

		Most people who want to write screenplays have a little of F. Scott Fitzgerald in them. The screenwriter is not responsible for writing in the camera angles and detailed shot terminology. It’s not the writer’s job. The writer’s job is to tell the director what to shoot, not how to shoot it. If you specify how each scene should be shot, the director will probably throw it away. And justifiably so.

		The writer’s job is to write the script. The director’s job is to film the script, to take words on paper and transform them into images on film. The cameraman’s function is to light the scene and position the camera so it cinematically captures the story.

		Here’s the way it works on almost every motion picture set. One day, I visited the set of Seabiscuit. Gary Ross, the incredibly gifted director, was rehearsing Tobey Maguire and Jeff Bridges in a scene, while John Schwartzman, the director of photography, was preparing to set up the camera.

		Gary Ross was sitting in a corner with Tobey Maguire and Jeff Bridges, going over the context of the scene. John Schwartzman was telling the crew where to put the lights. Ross, Maguire, and Bridges began blocking out the scene—who’d move on this line, who’d enter on this cue, who’d cross to the barn door, and so on. Once the blocking was established, Schwartzman followed them with his “eyepiece,” establishing the first camera angle. When Ross finished working with Bridges and Maguire, Schwartzman showed him where he wanted to position the camera. Ross agreed. They set up the camera, the actors walked through the scene, rehearsed it several times, made minor adjustments, and were ready for a take.

		Film is a collaborative medium; people work together to create a movie. Don’t worry about camera angles! Forget about writing scenes describing the intricate moves of a Panavision camera with a 50mm lens on a Chapman crane!

		Your job is to write the script, scene by scene, shot by shot.

		What is a shot?

		A shot is the cell, the kernel, of the action; a shot, basically, is what the camera sees.

		Scenes are made up of shots, either a single shot or a series of shots; how many, or what kind, is insignificant. There are all kinds of shots. You can write a descriptive scene like “the sun rises over the mountains” and the director may use one, three, five, or ten different shots to visually get the feeling of “sunrise over the mountains.”

		A scene is written in a master shot, or specific shots. A master shot covers a general area: a room, a street, a lobby. A specific shot focuses on a specific part of the room—a door, say, or in front of a specific store on a specific street. The scenes from American Beauty are mostly presented in master shot. The script Cold Mountain utilizes both specific shots and master shots. If you want to write a dialogue scene in master shot, all you need to write is INT. RESTAURANT—NIGHT, and simply let your characters speak without any reference to the camera or shot.

		You can be as general or specific as you want. A scene can be one shot (a car racing down the street) or a series of shots (a couple arguing on a street corner in front of a few bystanders).

		A shot is what the camera sees.

		Let’s take another look at the screenplay form.

		 			(1) EXT. ARIZONA DESERT—DAY

			(2) A blazing sun scorches the earth. Everything is flat, barren. In the distance, a cloud of dust rises as a jeep makes its way across the landscape.

			(3) MOVING

			A jeep races through sagebrush and cactus.

			(4) INT. JEEP—FAVORING JOE CHACO

			(5) Joe drives recklessly. ANDI sits next to him, an attractive girl in her mid-twenties.

			(6) ANDI

			(7) (shouting)

			(8) How much longer?

			JOE

			Couple o’ hours. You okay?

			(9) She smiles wearily.

			ANDI

			I’ll make it.

			(10) Suddenly, the motor SPUTTERS. They look at each other, concerned.

			(11) CUT TO:



		Simple, right?

		If you look at the example, you’ll see that the first line describes where we are: the desert in Arizona during the day. It could be morning or afternoon. It does not have to be more specific than that. It is called the Scene Heading or slug line, and it’s written in capital letters.

		We skip a line, then write, single-spaced, from margin to margin, the description, or action, of the scene. The description paragraph should deal only with what we see. Many times, the aspiring screenwriter will put various thoughts or feelings of the characters into the stage description, as if we, the reader, need to know what the character is thinking and feeling. If we can’t see it through hand or facial gestures, or hear it through the dialogue, don’t write it. If it’s written right, you don’t need to tell the reader what’s going on inside your character’s head.

		The character’s name, placed in caps, like JOE or ANDI, is located in the center of the page; if you want to describe some kind of physical or emotional action, use parentheses. The character is yelling, lying, angry, hesitant, happy, sad, resigned—all these terms describe how the character is speaking the dialogue, and they can be placed within the parentheses. When I’m writing a screenplay, I use a lot of stage directions wrapped in parentheses, explaining how I would like the character to respond, but when the script is completed, I go through the screenplay and remove all the stage directions. The actors will play things the way they want to play it, not how I want them to play it.

		The dialogue is located in the center of the page, single-spaced, and it is what the character says. What’s great about writing a screenplay is that the subtext of the scene, what is not said, can sometimes be more important than what is said. Again, dialogue serves two basic functions in the scene: Either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the character.

		This is proper, contemporary, and professional screenplay form. There are very few rules, and these are just the guidelines:

		Line 1—Called the slug line, or scene heading it states the general or specific locale. We are outside, EXT., somewhere in the ARIZONA DESERT; the time is DAY.

		Line 2—Double-space, then, the action is single-spaced: your description of people, places, or action, from margin to margin. Descriptions of characters or places should not be longer than a few lines. And descriptive paragraphs, describing the action, should be no longer than four sentences. That’s not a hard-and-fast rule, it’s only a suggestion. The more “white space” you can have on the page, the better it looks.

		Line 3—Double-space; the general term Moving specifies a change in camera focus. (It is not a camera instruction. It is a “suggestion.”)

		Line 4—Double-space; there is a change from outside the jeep to inside. We are focusing on the character, Joe Chaco. He is the subject of the shot.

		Line 5—New characters introduced are always capitalized.

		Line 6—The character speaking is always capitalized and placed in the center of the page.

		Line 7—Stage directions for the actor are written in parentheses under the name of the character speaking, always single-spaced. Don’t abuse parentheses; use only when necessary.

		Line 8—Dialogue is placed in the center of the page, so the character speaking forms a block in the center of the page, surrounded by description from margin to margin. Several lines of dialogue are always single-spaced.

		Line 9—Stage directions also include what characters do within the scene—any kind of reactions, silent and otherwise.

		Line 10—Sound effects, or music effects, are always capitalized. This is an old tradition in the moviemaking process. Usually the last step in the filmmaking process is to give the film to the music and effects editors. The film is “locked”—that is, the picture track cannot be changed or altered. And usually the production schedule is late and the sound effects and music editors don’t have enough time to go through each shot and scene to see what might be needed. So the tradition is that the writer capitalizes the needed effects. That way, the editors can skim quickly through the script looking for music and effects cues, and you can help them by putting references to music or sound effects in capitals. Don’t overdo effects. Don’t ask for specific songs by specific recording artists, but offer suggestions: “WE HEAR something like Norah Jones.” Again, you want to propose the feeling of the way you think things should look and feel. With a few exceptions, to use the specific song or music you want may be too expensive for the budget, so you simply “suggest” what you think might be appropriate.

		Film deals with two systems—the film, what we see, and the sound, what we hear. The film portion is complete before it goes to sound, and then the two are put together in sync. It is a long and complicated process. At present, with the widespread use of digital technology and the advances of computer graphic imagery, or CGI, there is a much broader use of multimedia effects—flash forwards, flashbacks, memory, bits and pieces of an old event—but the principles of the two systems remain intact, whether filming with film or in digital. To see the difference in style, you may want to look at Ordinary People and compare it with The Bourne Supremacy or Memento; in all three films the characters are trying to recover an incident, a lost memory.

		Line 11—If you choose to indicate the end of a scene you may write “CUT TO:” or “DISSOLVE TO:” (a dissolve is two images overlapping each other; one fades out as the other fades in) or “FADE OUT,” used to indicate a fade to black. It should be noted that optical effects like “fades” or “dissolves” are usually a film decision, made by the director or film editor. It is not the writer’s decision, but if it makes you feel more comfortable in terms of how to read the screenplay, do it.

		That’s all there is to basic screenplay form. It’s simple—so simple it’s difficult, because each screenplay is unique and can be visualized in a myriad of ways. Just don’t tell the director what to do and how to do it.

		For most aspiring screenwriters, it’s a new form, so give yourself time to learn how to write it. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. It takes a while to get used to it, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. Often I have students simply copy ten pages of a screenplay just to get the feel of the form. It doesn’t matter what screenplay it is; choose ten pages at random and just copy it on the computer. If you want, get screenwriting software to help remove the doubt and confusion. Final Draft is the best screenwriting software around and is used by professionals like Tom Hanks, Alan Ball, Steven Bochco, Julie Taymor, James L. Brooks, Anthony Minghella, and others.

		As mentioned before, it is not the writer’s job to write in camera angles. As a matter of fact, the word “camera” is rarely used in the contemporary screenplay. “But,” people say, “if you don’t use the word ‘camera’ and the shot is what the camera sees, how do you write the shot description?”

		The rule is: FIND THE SUBJECT OF YOUR SHOT! Then describe it.

		What does the camera, the eye in the middle of your forehead, see? What takes place within the frame of each shot?

		If Bill walks out of his apartment to his car, what is the subject of the shot?

		Bill? The apartment? The car?

		Bill, of course. He is the subject of the shot.

		If Bill gets into his car and drives down the street, what is the subject of the shot? Bill, the car, or the street?

		The car is, unless you want the scene to take place inside the car: INT. CAR—DAY. Moving or not moving. Then you can focus on Bill.

		Once you determine the subject of the shot, you’re ready to describe the visual action that takes place within the shot or scene.

		I’ve compiled a list of terms to replace the word “camera” in your screenplay. If you’re ever in doubt about whether to use the word “camera,” do not use it; find another term to replace it. These general terms used in shot descriptions will allow you to write your screenplay simply, effectively, and visually.

		SCREENPLAY TERMS

		(to replace the word CAMERA)

		RULE: FIND THE SUBJECT OF YOUR SHOT.

		 			 				 					1.

ANGLE ON 				 				 A person, place, or thing—ANGLE ON Bill (the subject of the shot) leaving his apartment building.

			 				 					2.

FAVORING 				 				 Also a person, place, or thing—FAVORING Bill (subject of the shot) as he leaves his apartment.

			 				 					3.

ANOTHER

ANGLE 				 				 A variation of a SHOT—ANOTHER ANGLE of Bill walking out of his apartment.

			 				 					4.

WIDER

ANGLE 				 				 A change of focus in a scene—You go from an ANGLE ON Bill to a WIDER ANGLE that now can include Bill and his surroundings.

			 				 					5.

NEW

ANGLE 				 				 Another variation on a shot, often used to “break up the page” for a more “cinematic look”—A NEW ANGLE of Bill and Jane dancing at a party.

			 				 					6.

POV 				 				 A person’s POINT OF VIEW, how something looks to him/her—ANGLE ON Bill, dancing with Jane, and from JANE’S POV Bill is smiling, having a good time. This could also be considered the CAMERA’S POV.

			 				 					7.

REVERSE

ANGLE 				 				 					A change in perspective, usually the opposite of the POV shot—for example, Bill’s POV as he looks at Jane, and a REVERSE ANGLE of Jane looking at Bill—that is, what she sees.

			 				 					8.

OVER

THE

SHOULDER 				 				 					Often used for POV and REVERSE shots. Usually the back of a character’s head is in the foreground of the frame and what he is looking at is the background of the frame. The frame is the boundary line of what the CAMERA sees—sometimes referred to as the “frame line.”

			 				 					9.

MOVING

SHOT 				 				 					Focuses on the movement of a shot—A MOVING SHOT of the jeep racing across the desert. Bill walking Jane to the door. Ted moves to answer the phone. All you have to indicate is MOVING SHOT. Forget about trucking shots, pans, tilts, dollies, zooms, or cranes.

			 				 					10.

CLOSE

SHOT 				 				 					What it says—close. Used sparingly, for emphasis. A CLOSE SHOT of Bill as he stares at Jane’s roommate. When Jake Gittes, in Chinatown, has a knife in his nose, Robert Towne indicates a CLOSE SHOT. It is one of the few times he uses the term in the screenplay.

			 				 					11.

INSERT 				 				 A close shot of “something”—a photograph, newspaper story, headline, face of a clock, watch, telephone number…

		 		Knowing these terms will help you write a screenplay from the position of choice, confidence, and security—so you know what you’re doing without the need of specific camera directions.

		Take a look at contemporary screenplay form. Here are the first pages, the opening sequence, of the action film The Run. It is the story of a man setting out to break the Water Speed Record in a rocket boat. The opening is an action sequence.

		Examine the form; look for the subject in each shot, and how each shot presents an individual mosaic within the tapestry of the sequence. (The “first time around” refers to the title of the individual sequence; it is the first attempt at breaking the Water Speed Record.)

			“THE RUN”

			FADE IN:

			“first time around”

			EXT. BANKS LAKE, WASHINGTON—JUST BEFORE DAWN

			A SERIES OF ANGLES

			A few hours before dawn. Some stars and a full moon are pinned to the early-morning sky.

			BANKS LAKE is a long sleeve of water nestled against the concrete walls of the Grand Coulee Dam. The water reflects the shimmering reflection of the moon. All is quiet. Peaceful. Hold.

			Then, we HEAR the high-pitched ROAR of a truck. And, we:

			CUT TO:

			HEADLIGHTS—MOVING

			A pickup truck moved INTO FRAME. PULL BACK to reveal the truck hauling a large trailer, the puzzling-shaped cargo covered with a tarpaulin. It could be anything—a piece of modern sculpture, a missile, a space capsule. As a matter of fact, it’s all three.

			A CARAVAN

			of seven vehicles winds its way slowly along the tree-lined highway. A pickup truck and station wagon lead the group. Another station wagon is followed by a truck and trailer. Bringing up the rear are two large camper trailers and a tool van. They bear the insignia “Saga Men’s Cologne.”

			INT. LEAD STATION WAGON

			Three people are in the wagon. The radio plays softly, a Country & Western tune.

			STRUT BOWMAN drives, a lean and expressive Texan who happens to be the best sheet-metal man and mechanical wizard west of the Mississippi.

			RYAN WILLS sits next to the window staring moodily into the predawn darkness. Strong-willed and stubborn, he is considered by many to be a flamboyant boat designer, a crackpot genius, or a daredevil race driver. All three are true.

			(2)

			ROGER DALTON sits in the backseat. A quiet man, he wears glasses and looks like the rocket systems analyst he is.

			THE VEHICLES

			wind their way along the wood-lined highway heading toward the Grand Coulee Dam and the sleeve of water known as Banks Lake. (Formerly, it was known as Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake.)

			EXT. BANKS LAKE—DAWN

			The sky lightens as the caravan moves to the far side, the vehicles looking like a column of fire-flies parading before the dawn.

			THE BOATHOUSE AREA

			The cars pull in and park. The lead truck pulls to a stop and a few CREW MEMBERS jump out. Others follow and the activity begins.

			A long Quonset hut has been erected near the water. The BOATHOUSE, as it’s known, houses the work area and is complete with work benches, lights, and tool area. The two campers park nearby.

			A FEW CREWMEN

			jump out and begin unloading various equipment, taking it into the work area.

			THE STATION WAGON

			Strut parks the wagon; Ryan is the first out, followed by Roger. Ryan walks into the boathouse.

			A TV CONTROL VAN

			From Sports World, as well as some local Seattle sportscasters, begin setting up their equipment.

			THE OFFICIALS AND TIMERS

			all with the initials FIA emblazoned on their shirts, set up electronic timing devices, timing boards, digital consoles, and floating timing buoys. Video images from the TV Control Monitor are assembled into a montage of activity. The “feel” of this sequence should begin slowly, like someone waking up, then gradually build into a rhythm of a tense and exciting rocket-launch sequence.

			(3)

			INT. CAMPER LIVING QUARTERS—JUST AFTER DAWN

			Ryan puts on his asbestos racing suit and Strut helps him lace it up. He steps into his cover suit, the name “Saga Men’s Cologne” clearly seen. Strut fixes something on the suit, and the two men exchange a glance.

			Over this, we HEAR the voice of the:

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			This is Ryan Wills. Most of you already know the story—one of the most innovative racing designers of high-speed water vehicles, Wills, the son of wealthy industrialist Timothy Wills, was approached by Saga Men’s Cologne to build a racing boat that would break the Water Speed Record, currently 286 miles an hour, held by Leigh Taylor. Ryan did that and more: He designed and built the world’s first rocket boat—that’s right, rocket boat—revolutionary in concept and design—

			THE BOATHOUSE

			Moving out of the boathouse, mounted on two specially constructed mounts, is the rocket boat, “Prototype I,” a gleaming, missile-like boat that looks like a Delta-winged aircraft. It is beautifully designed, a piece of sculpture. The crew members guide the boat onto the launching track, disappearing into the water. Over this, the TV announcer continues.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO, contd.)

			Just how fast it will go is unknown—some people claim it won’t even work! But Wills says this boat can easily break the 400-mile-an-hour barrier. But the sponsor, Saga Cologne, couldn’t get anyone to drive this amazing rocket boat—it’s too radical, too unsafe. That’s when Ryan, the former hydroplane racer, stepped in and said, “I’ll do it!”

			INT. TV CONTROL VAN BOOTH

			We SEE a bank of TV monitor screens. MOVE IN to a screen where the TV ANNOUNCER is interviewing Ryan Wills at a press conference.

			(4)

			RYAN (on TV screen)

			I built this boat, piece by piece—I know it like the back of my hand. If I thought there was the slightest chance of failure, or that I might possibly hurt myself, or kill myself—if I didn’t think it was completely safe, I wouldn’t do it! Somebody’s got to do it so it might as well be me! I mean, that’s what this life’s all about, isn’t it? Taking risks?

			TV ANNOUNCER (on screen)

			Aren’t you nervous, scared?

			RYAN (on screen)

			Of course—but I’m confident I can do the job. If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t be here. It’s my choice. I’m ready to set a new Water Speed Record and live long enough to give you a chance to interview me after I do it!

			He laughs.

			OLIVIA

			Ryan’s wife, stands nervously on the sidelines, biting her lip. She’s scared and she shows it.

			EXT. TV CONTROL VAN—EARLY MORNING

			The TV ANNOUNCER from Ryan’s interview stands near the Control Van, the lake in b.g.

			TV ANNOUNCER

			Several years ago, Ryan Wills was a highly successful hydroplane racer. He gave it up after an accident put him in the hospital—some of you remember that—

			FLASHBACK—BANKS LAKE, WASHINGTON—DAY

			Ryan’s hydroplane flips over and over and over until it lands bottom up. Ryan is thrown free and floats motionless in the water.

			BACK TO PRESENT—THE START AREA

			A finger-like dock stretches into the water. A tow-boat is tied to it.

			(5)

			PROTOTYPE I

			sits on top of the water, being fueled; two oxygen tanks connected with long polyethylene tubing disappear into the engine. Roger supervises the fueling.

			RYAN

			Ryan steps out of the camper and walks toward the rocket boat. Strut is with him.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			So, here we are—at Banks Lake in eastern Washington, right next to the Grand Coulee Dam—where Ryan Wills will attempt to be the first man in history to set a Water Speed Record in a rocket boat.

			AT THE START SITE

			Ryan walks down the dock and steps into the boat.

			AT TIMING CONTROL

			A series of digital timing mechanisms race wildly, end at zero across the board.

			INT. TV CONTROL BOARD IN VAN

			The DIRECTOR sits in front of the TV Monitor Console and prepares for the TV broadcast. Eight screens are banked in front of him, each with a different image: crew, finish line, lake, timing buoys, crowd, etc. One screen follows Ryan as he prepares for the run.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			Working with Ryan are his two coworkers—Strut Bowman, the mechanical engineer—

			STRUT

			in the tow-boat, walkie-talkie in hand, watching Ryan carefully.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			—and Roger Dalton, a rocket systems analyst, one of the lead scientists from the Jet Propulsion Lab, and formerly on the team of the Galileo mission.

			ROGER

			checking fuel gauges and other details. Everything’s ready.

			(6)

			RYAN

			is buckled into the cockpit. Strut is in the tow-boat, nearby.

			INT. ROCKET BOAT COCKPIT

			Ryan checks the three gauges on the control panel in front of him. He flicks a toggle switch marked “fuel flow”; a needle jumps into position and holds. He clicks another toggle switch, marked “water flow,” and another needle is activated. A red button switch lights up and we see the word “armed.” Ryan puts his hand on the steering wheel, positions one finger next to the “eject” button.

			RYAN

			He checks the gauges, takes a few deep breaths. He’s ready.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			Ryan appears ready—

			A SERIES OF ANGLES

			of the countdown. Crews, timers, and spectators quiet down; electronic devices hold at zero; the TV camera crew is focused on Prototype I, poised like a bird on the edge of flight.

			STRUT

			watches Ryan, waits for him to give the “thumbs-up” signal.

			RYAN

			All we see are eyes peering out of a crash helmet. Concentration high, intention high.

			THE TIMING COMPLEX

			The timers wait, all eyes riveted on the timing mechanisms and the boat on the lake.

			THE LAKE

			is quiet, the metric-mile course marked out with three timing buoys.

			AT THE FINISH LINE—JACK’S POV

			Roger and two crewmen stand looking down course, watching the dot that is the boat.

			THE TV CREW

			waits, the air heavy with tense anticipation.

			(7)

			RYAN’S POV

			He stares down course, the “armed” button clearly seen in foreground.

			STRUT

			checks and double-checks final details. Ryan’s ready. He checks the timers—they’re ready. It’s a “go.” He gives “thumbs-up” to Ryan and waits for Ryan’s signal.

			RYAN

			returns “thumbs-up.”

			STRUT

			talks into the walkie-talkie.

			STRUT

			Timing sequence ready—

			(he begins his countdown)

			5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0—

			THE TIMING BUOY

			flashes three lights sequentially, red, yellow, then green.

			RYAN

			flips the “on” switch and suddenly

			THE ROCKET BOAT

			explodes into motion, the finger-like flame searing the surface of the water as it leaps forward.

			THE BOAT

			literally flies toward the end of the lake like a missile, hovering several inches above the water as the hydrofoil tines skim along the water at over 300 mi/hr.

			THIS INTERCUT

			with Strut, Olivia, the timers, Roger at the finish line, the TV Monitor screens in the TV control van.

			RYAN’S POV

			The periphery landscape is distorted, flattened as the world plunges into silence and high-speed visual images.

			THE BOAT

			streaks by as the

			(8)

			DIGITAL NUMBERS

			of the timing mechanisms race toward infinity.

			VARIOUS ANGLES

			as the boat hurtles toward the finish line. Crew, timers, spectators watch in breathless wonder.

			RYAN

			holds on to the steering wheel when suddenly we see his hands twitch slightly as the boat vibrates.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			It’s a solid run—

			THE TIMING CONSOLE

			The digital numbers spin at a dizzying speed.

			RYAN’S POV

			The boat SHIMMIES, builds into a pronounced vibration jarring the entire landscape view. Something is terribly wrong.

			FROM THE SHORE

			We see the rooster tail becoming irregular and choppy.

			STRUT AND OLIVIA

			watch the boat shaking violently.

			A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

			intercut between spectators and boat. Prototype I veers off course, Ryan frozen at the wheel.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			Wait a minute—something’s not—

			something’s wrong—the boat’s shaking—

			PROTOTYPE I

			lists to one side.

			RYAN

			pushes the eject button.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			(hysterical)

			Ryan can’t hold it! He’s crashing—

			Ryan’s crashing—oh, my God—

			(9)

			THE COCKPIT

			ejects, arches high into the air, the parachute trailing behind it.

			THE CAPSULE

			heads toward the water.

			STRUT, THE CREW, TIMERS, OLIVIA

			watch horrified, disbelieving.

			THE BOAT

			tips over, smashes into the water, careens out of control, then cartwheels over and over again, until it disintegrates before our very eyes.

			TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

			Ryan’s ejected—wait a minute—the chute’s not opening—oh, Lord, what has happened here today…

			VARIOUS ANGLES

			as the parachute attached to the capsule fails to open. Ryan, encased in the plastic cockpit, hits the water at over 300 mi/hr.

			The capsule bounces and skips across the water like a stone on a pond. We can only guess what’s happening to Ryan inside. The capsule speeds more than a mile before it finally comes to a stop.

			Silence. The world seems frozen in time. And then:

			Ambulance SIRENS shatter the silence, and all hell breaks loose as people move toward the lifeless figure of Ryan Wills floating helplessly in the water. Hold, then:

			CUT TO:



		Notice how each shot describes the action and how the terms on the list are used to give it a “cinematic” look without resorting to excessive camera instruction.

		Read as many screenplays as you can to familiarize yourself with the form. There are many Web sites devoted to the screenplay. You can download scripts free of charge at sites like simplyscripts.com; or Drew’s Script-O-Rama.com; or dailyscript.com; or do a Google or Yahoo! search for “screenplays” and see what comes up. There are many, many sites, and many, many screenplays you can download. To get familiar writing in screenplay form, choose any script, open to any page, and copy ten pages of the screenplay. This exercise is to allow you to get used to the form. Look for the “subject” of the shot. The more scripts you read, the more familiar with the form you’ll become.

		Allow yourself some time to learn how to do it; it will probably be uncomfortable at first, but it gets easier. The more you do, the easier it gets. When you don’t have to think about what you’re doing in terms of screenplay form, it becomes second nature. Of course, the easiest way to write in screenplay form is to get screenwriting software like Final Draft. Check it out at www.finaldraft.com.

		Once you become familiar with the form, you’re ready to move on to the next step: the scene.

		Writing the Screenplay


		 			BAGBY:

			“Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it—but you can’t drink it, you can’t water your lawns with it, you can’t irrigate an orange grove with it. Remember—we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert. Los Angeles is a desert community. Beneath this building, beneath every street, there’s a desert. Without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we’d never existed!”

			—Chinatown

			Robert Towne





“Either you bring the water to L.A.—or you bring L.A. to the water.” That’s the underlying foundation of Chinatown. To weave this theme through the screenplay, dramatizing it through action and character, is just great screenwriting. Speaking to Robert Towne about the amazing journey of writing Chinatown, however, uncovers a story of doubt, confusion, and uncertainty. Writing a screenplay is an amazing, mysterious phenomenon filled with joy, frustration, sometimes even sorrow. One day you’re totally on top of things, the next day you’re down, lost in a maze of confusion and uncertainty. One day it works, the next day it doesn’t; who knows how or why. It is the creative process; it defies analysis, except to say it is magic and it is wonder.

		The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. Take a look back and see where we’ve come from. Here is the paradigm:





		In the beginning, we talked about creating a subject, like three guys stealing moon rocks from Houston’s NASA facility. We broke it down into an action and character. We talked about choosing a main character and one or two major characters, and channeling their action into stealing the moon rocks. We talked about determining our ending, our beginning, the Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II. Then we discussed building the story line with 3 × 5 cards, focusing on the direction, the line of development, we wish to follow.

		Look at the paradigm: WE KNOW WHAT TO WRITE!

		We’ve completed a form of preparation applicable to all writing in general, and the screenplay in particular; it is form, structure, and character. You are now able to select the elements of your story that fall inside the paradigm of screenplay form and begin the journey of writing it from beginning to end. In other words, you know what to write; now all you’ve got to do is write it.

		Whatever has been said or written about the experience of writing, or the creative process, it still boils down to one thing—writing is your own, personal experience. Nobody else’s.

		There are a lot of people who contribute to the making of a movie, but the writer is the only person who sits down and faces the blank sheet of paper.

		Writing is hard work, a day-by-day job, sitting in front of your computer or notepad day in, day out, getting the words down on paper. You’ve got to put in the time. And some days are better than others.

		Before you begin writing, you’ve got to find the time to write.

		How many hours a day do you need to spend writing?

		That depends on you. I work about four hours a day, six days a week. Stuart Beattie writes eight hours a day, from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. with a one-hour break. Robert Towne writes four to five hours a day, six days a week. Some screenwriters work only one hour a day; some write in the early morning, some in the late afternoon, some at night. Some writers write twelve hours a day. Other writers work on a story in their head for months, telling it over and over again to people until they know it completely; then they “jump in” and write it in about two weeks. After that, they’ll spend weeks polishing and fixing it.

		Most people need about two to three hours a day to write a screenplay. That’s ideal, but sometimes not very practical. In many of my screenwriting classes, I tell my students that if they’re working full-time and cannot spend an hour or two a day writing before they go to work, or when they get home, they need to keep the idea current in their minds. They constantly need to think about the story line, the characters, and “what happens next.” Sometimes I tell them to carry the cards with them, so they can go over the material when they’re standing in line or riding on the subway, bus, or train. Keeping a tape recorder with you when you’re driving to work, on lunch or coffee break, or on your way home, helps you to focus on your thoughts and ideas so you can remember them. Then, before you fall asleep at night, listen to your ideas or lines of dialogue and you’ll be able to keep the material fresh in your memory. When the weekend rolls around, you can spend around two or three quality hours on Saturday and/or Sunday working on the script.

		What’s the best time for you to write? Look at your daily schedule. Examine your time. If you’re working full-time, or caring for home and family, your time is limited. You’re going to have to find the best time for you to write. Are you the kind of person who works best in the morning? Or does it take you until early afternoon to be wide awake and alert? Late at night may be a good time. You’re going to have to experiment. Find out.

		You may get up and write a few hours before you go to work; or you might come home from work, unwind, and then write a few hours. You may want to work at night, say about 10 or 11 P.M., or you may go to bed early and wake up about 4 or 5 A.M. to write. One of my students, a major studio executive, gets up at 5 each morning, works for an hour or two, has breakfast with his family, and leaves for work. It’s hard, but you can do it. If you’re a housewife and have a family, you may want to write when everyone’s gone for the day, either midmorning or midafternoon. You be the judge of what time, day or night, you can get two to three hours alone.

		And a few hours alone means a few hours alone. No telephone, no friends for coffee, no idle chatter, no chores, no demands made on you by husbands, wives, lovers, or children. You need two to three hours alone, without interruption.

		Writing is a day-by-day job—shot by shot, scene by scene, page by page, day by day. Set goals for yourself. Three pages a day is reasonable and realistic. If a screenplay is approximately 120 pages long, and you write three pages a day, five days a week, how long will it take you to write a first draft?

		About forty working days. If you work five days a week, that means you can get a first draft done in about six weeks. Once you start the writing process, you’ll have days when you write ten pages, days when you do three, and so on. Just make sure you try for three pages a day. Or more.

		If you’re married, or in a relationship, it’s going to be difficult—you need some space and private time, as well as support and encouragement.

		Women with families can have a more difficult time than others. Husbands and children are not always very understanding or supportive. No matter how many times you explain that you’re “going to be writing,” it doesn’t help. Demands are made that are difficult to ignore. I’ve had married women tell me their husbands threaten to leave them unless they stop writing, and their children turn into monsters; the domestic routine is being interfered with, and none of them like it. It’s tough to handle; emotions of guilt, anger, or frustration get in the way of your need for the time, space, and freedom to write, and if you don’t watch out you can easily become a victim of your emotions.

		When you’re in the writing experience, you’re near your loved ones in body, but your mind and concentration are a thousand miles away. Your family doesn’t care or understand that your characters are in a highly charged situation; you can’t break your concentration to deal with the snacks, meals, medication, doctors’ appointments, laundry, and shopping that you normally do.

		Don’t expect to. If you’re in a relationship, your loved ones will tell you they understand and support you, but they won’t—not really. Not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t understand the writing experience.

		Don’t feel guilty about taking the time you need to write your screenplay. If you expect your wife, husband, or lover to “get upset” or “not understand” when you’re writing, it won’t bother you when it happens. If it does. You have to be “at choice” when you’re writing; expect a tough time and it won’t bother you if it happens.

		A note to all husbands, wives, lovers, friends, and children: If your wife, husband, lover, friend, or parent is writing a screenplay, they need your love and support.

		Give them the opportunity to explore their desire to write a screenplay. During the time they’re writing, anywhere from three to six months, they’re often going to be moody, explosive, easily upset, preoccupied, and distant. Your daily routine is going to be interfered with, and you’re not going to like it. It might become uncomfortable.

		Are you willing to give them the space and opportunity to write what they want to write? Do you love them enough to support them in their efforts even if it interferes with your life?

		If the answer is no, talk about it. Work out a way so that both sides can win, and then support each other in your communication. Writing is a lonely, solitary job. For a person in a relationship, it becomes a joint experience.

		Establish a writing schedule: 10:30 to noon; or 8 to 10 P.M.; or 9 P.M. to midnight. With a schedule, the “problem” of discipline becomes easier to handle.

		Decide how many days you’re going to be writing. If you’re working full-time, in school, or involved in a marriage or relationship, with the proper preparation you can expect to work one or two days a week. Just keep your focus—otherwise creative energy is lost. You’ve got to concentrate clearly on the script you’re writing.

		With your writing schedule set up, you can get down to work; and one fine day you will sit down to write.

		What’s the first thing that’s going to happen?

		Resistance, that’s what.

		After you write FADE IN: EXT. STREET—DAY you’ll suddenly be seized with an incredible urge to sharpen your pencils or clean your work area. You’ll find a reason or an excuse not to write. That’s resistance.

		Writing is an experiential process, a learning process involving the acquisition of skill and coordination, like riding a bicycle, swimming, dancing, or playing tennis.

		Nobody learns to swim by being thrown into the water. You learn to swim by perfecting your form, and you can only do that by actually swimming; the more you do, the better you get.

		It’s the same with writing. You’re going to experience some form of resistance. It shows itself in many ways, and most of the time we aren’t even aware it’s happening.

		For example: When you first sit down to start writing, you may suddenly get the urge to clean the refrigerator. Or to wash the kitchen floor. You may want to go to the gym, change the sheets, take a drive, eat, watch television, take a yoga class, or have sex. Some people go out and buy a thousand dollars’ worth of clothes they don’t need or want! You may get angry, impatient, and yell at everybody and anybody for nothing in particular.

		They’re all forms of resistance.

		One of my favorite forms of resistance is sitting down to write and suddenly getting an idea for another screenplay—a much better idea, an idea so unique, so original, so exciting, you wonder what you’re doing writing this screenplay. You really think about it.

		You may even get two or three “better” ideas. It happens quite often; it may be a great idea, but it’s still a form of resistance! If it’s really a good idea, it will keep. Simply write it up in a page or two, put it in a file marked “New Projects,” and file it away. If you decide to pursue this new idea and abandon the original project, you’ll discover the same thing happening; When you sit down to write, you’ll get another new idea, and so on and so on. It’s a form of resistance; a mind trip, a way of avoiding writing.

		We all do it. We’re masters at creating reasons and excuses not to write; it’s simply a barrier to the creative process.

		So, how do you deal with it?

		Simple. If you know it’s going to happen, simply acknowledge it when it does. When you’re cleaning the refrigerator, sharpening pencils, or eating, just know that’s what you’re doing: experiencing resistance! It’s no big thing. Don’t put yourself down, feel guilty, feel worthless, or punish yourself in any way. Just acknowledge the resistance—then move right through to the other side. Just don’t pretend it’s not happening. It is! Once you deal with your resistance, you’re ready to start writing.

		The first ten pages are the most difficult. Your writing is going to be awkward, stilted, and probably not very good. It’s okay. Some people won’t be able to deal with that; they’ll make a decision that what they’re writing is no good. They’ll stop, righteous and justified because they “knew they couldn’t do it.” “Who am I kidding?” is the usual refrain.

		Writing is a learned coordination; the more you do the easier it gets.

		At first, your dialogue’s probably not going to be very good.

		Remember that dialogue is a function of character. Let’s review the purpose of dialogue. Dialogue:

		 			• moves the story forward;

			• reveals information about the characters—after all, they do have a history;

			• communicates necessary facts and information to the reader;

			• establishes character relationships, making them real, natural, and spontaneous;

			• gives your characters depth, insight, and purpose;

			• reveals the conflicts of the story and characters;

			• reveals the emotional states of your characters; and

			• comments on the action.



		Your first attempts at writing dialogue will probably be unnatural, clichéd, fragmented, and strained. Writing dialogue is like learning to swim: You’re going to flounder around at first, but the more you do the easier it gets.

		It takes anywhere from forty to fifty pages before your characters start talking to you. And they do start talking to you. Let yourself write shitty pages, with stilted, direct, dumb, and obvious dialogue. Don’t worry about it. Just keep writing. Dialogue can always be cleaned up during the rewrite. “Writing is rewriting” is the ancient adage.

		Those of you who are looking for “inspiration” to guide you won’t find it. Inspiration is measured in moments, a few minutes or hours; a screenplay depends on diligence, and is measured in weeks and months. If it takes you a hundred days to write a screenplay, and you’re “on” for ten of those days, consider yourself lucky. Being “on” for a hundred days, or even twenty-five days, just doesn’t happen. You may hear that it does, but in truth it’s the pot at the end of the rainbow—you’re chasing a dream.

		“But—” you say.

		But what?

		Writing is a day-by-day job, two to three hours a day, five days a week, either during the day or on weekends, three or more pages a day, ten pages a week. Shot by shot, scene by scene, sequence by sequence, page by page, act by act. And some days are better than others.

		When you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm.

		The card system is your map and your guide; the Plot Points your checkpoints along the way, the “last-chance” gas station before you hit the high desert; the ending, your destination. What’s nice about the card system is that you can forget it. The cards have served their purpose.

		I said in Chapter 12 that one card equals one scene, but when you’re writing the screenplay, that will be contradictory. You’ll suddenly “discover” a new scene that works better or that you hadn’t thought of. Use it. It will lead you to veer off the path of the cards into a few new scenes or sequences that you hadn’t even considered. I think that’s great. Do it. You’ll be able to tell within a few pages whether it’s working or not. Usually you’ll finish the pages, then won’t know what to do, or where to go. Look at the next card. You’ll find you have a perfect lead-in to the next scene on the cards. If it doesn’t work, all you’ve lost is a couple of days, but you’ve maintained your creative energy. You haven’t really lost anything.

		It doesn’t matter if you want to drop scenes or add new ones; just do it. Your creative mind has assimilated the cards so you can throw out a few scenes and still be following the direction of your story.

		When you’re doing the cards, you’re doing the cards. When you’re writing the screenplay, you’re writing the screenplay. Forget a rigid adherence to the cards. Let them guide you, but don’t be a slave to them. If you feel a spontaneous moment that gives you a better, more fluid story, write it.

		So, what are some qualities that make up good screenwriting? Several things, perhaps the most important of which is to understand that the foundation of all good dramatic writing is conflict. Stating it once again, all drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action; without action you have no character; without character, you have no story. And without story, you have no screenplay.

		Dramatic conflict can be either internal or external; stories like The Hours, Chinatown, The Manchurian Candidate, A Place in the Sun (Michael Wilson and Harry Brown), Cold Mountain, and American Beauty have both internal and external conflict. External conflict is where the conflict is outside the characters and they face physical (and of course, emotional) obstacles, such as in Cold Mountain, Collateral, Apollo 13, or Jurassic Park. Creating conflict within the story, through the characters and events, is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing, whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.

		So what is conflict? If you look up the word, you’ll see it involves “opposition”; and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character or characters be in opposition to someone or something. Conflict can be anything: a struggle, a quarrel, a battle, or a chase scene; fear of life, or fear of failure or success; internal or external—any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental.

		Conflict must be at the very hub of your story, because it is the core of strong action and strong character. If you do not have enough conflict, the foundation to your writing, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in a quagmire of dull writing.

		Keep writing, day by day, page by page. And during the writing process you’re going to discover things about yourself you never knew. For example, if you’re writing about something that happened to you, you may reexperience some old feelings and emotions. You may get “wacky” and irritable and live each day as if you were on an emotional roller coaster. Don’t worry. Just keep writing.

		You’re going to move through three stages of your first-draft screenplay.

		The first stage is the “words on paper” stage. That’s when you put it all down—everything. During this stage, if you’re in doubt about writing a scene or not writing it, write it. If in doubt, write. That’s the rule. If you start censoring yourself, you might wind up with an eighty-page screenplay, and that’s too short. (Comedies, however, are usually about eighty-five to ninety pages.) You’ll have to add scenes to what is with any luck an already tight structure to fill it out and bring it to length, and that’s extremely difficult to do. It’s easier to cut scenes than add them to an already structured screenplay.

		Keep moving forward in your story. If you write a scene and go back to clean it up, polish it, and “make it right,” you’ll find you’ve dried up at about page 60, lost all your creative spark, and you might even shelve the project. Many writers I know who’ve tried to write a draft this way have failed to complete it. Any major changes you need to make, do in the second draft.

		There will be moments when you don’t know how to begin a scene, or what to do next. You know what happens on the cards, but not how to get into it visually. If this happens, break down the action of your scene into a beginning, middle, and end. What’s the purpose of the scene? Where does your character come from? What is his/her purpose in the scene?

		Ask yourself “What happens next?” and you’ll get an answer. It’s usually the first thought skittering across the back of your mind. Grab it, and throw it down on paper. It’s what I call the “creative grab,” because you’ve got to be quick enough to “catch it” and put it down.

		Many times you’ll try to improve that first idea to “make it better.” If your first thought is to place the scene in a car driving down the highway, and you decide to make it a walk in the country or a walk on the beach, you’ll lose a certain creative energy. Do it too many times and your script will reflect a contrived, deliberate quality. It won’t work.

		There’s only one rule that governs your writing—not whether it’s “good” or “bad,” but does it work? Does your scene or sequence work? If it does, keep it in, no matter what anybody says.

		If it works, use it. If it doesn’t, don’t.

		If you don’t know how to get in or out of a scene, free-associate. Let your mind wander; ask yourself the best way to get into the scene. Trust yourself and you’ll find the answer.

		If you created the problem, you’ll be able to find a solution to it. All you have to do is look for it.

		Problems in a screenplay can always be solved. Just know that if you’ve created the problem, whatever it is, you can solve it. If you get stuck, go back to your characters; go into your character biography and ask him/her what he or she would do in that situation. You’ll get an answer. It may take a minute, an hour, a day, several days, a week, but you’ll get the answer—probably when you least expect it, and in the most unusual place. Just keep asking yourself the question “What do I need to do to solve this problem?” Run it through your head constantly, especially before you go to sleep. If I have a problem like this I give myself a dream assignment: “Please reveal the answer to the problem during my dream state.” It can be a very powerful tool. Give yourself time for the answer to reveal itself to you, but trust in the process.

		Writing is the ability to ask yourself questions and get the answers.

		Sometimes you’ll get into a scene and not know where you’re going, or what you’re looking for to make it work. You know the context, not the content. So you’ll write the same scene five different times, from five different points of view, and out of all these attempts you may find one line that gives you the key to what you’re looking for.

		You’ll rewrite the scene using that one line as your anchor thought and eventually be able to create something dynamic and spontaneous. You just have to find your way.

		And trust yourself.

		Around page 80 or 90, the resolution is forming and you’ll discover the screenplay is literally writing itself. You’re just the medium, putting in time to finish the script. You don’t have to do anything; if you let it come through you, it writes itself.

		Writing a screenplay is writing a screenplay. There are no shortcuts.

		It may take you six to eight weeks to complete your first “words on paper” draft. Then you’re ready to move into the second stage of your first draft: taking a cold, hard, objective look at what you’ve written.

		This is the most mechanical and uninspiring stage of writing a screenplay. You’ll take what is perhaps a 180- to 200-page draft of your script and reduce it to 130 or 140 pages. You’ll cut out some scenes, add new ones, rewrite others, make any changes you need to, to get it into a workable form. It might take you about three weeks to do this. When you’ve finished, you’re ready to approach the third stage of your first-draft script. This is where you see what you’ve got, where the story really gets written. You’ll polish it, accent it, hone and rewrite it, trim it to length, and make it all come to life. You’re out of the paradigm now, so you can see what you’ve got to do to make it better. In this stage you may rewrite a scene as many as ten times before you get it right.

		There will always be one or two scenes that don’t work the way you want them to, no matter how many times you rewrite them. You know these scenes don’t work, but the reader will never know. He/she reads for story and execution, not content. It usually takes me about an hour to read a script, seeing it in my head rather than reading it for prose style or content. Don’t worry about the few scenes you know don’t work. Let them be.

		You’ll discover that the scenes you like the most, those clever, witty, and sparkling moments of action and dialogue, might have to be cut when you reduce the script to workable length. You’ll try to keep them in—after all, it is your best writing—but in the long run you’ve got to do what’s best for your screenplay. I have a “best scene” file where I put the “best” things I’ve ever written, things I had to cut out to tighten the script.

		You have to be ruthless in writing a screenplay. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. If your scenes stand out and draw attention to themselves, they might impede the flow of action. Scenes that stand out and work are the scenes that will be remembered. Every good film has one or possibly two scenes that people always remember. These scenes work within the dramatic context of the story. They are also the trademark scenes that later become immediately recognizable.

		If you don’t know whether your “choice” scenes work, they probably don’t. If you have to think about it, or question it, it probably means it’s not working. You’ll know when a scene’s working. Trust yourself.

		There may be times during the screenwriting process when you experience a sinking sensation in the pit of your stomach, when suddenly there is a cloud of negativity and confusion sprinkled on the waters of your creativity. And it seems to come out of nowhere.

		Most writers, including myself, try to ignore the feeling, to push it away, hide it under the carpet; yet the more we try to dispel it, to pretend it’s not there, to hover behind a false bravado, the more we realize we’re stuck, lost somewhere within a maze of our own creation.

		That’s when we hit “the wall.” Almost all writers, at some time or other, experience this wall, or block, and try to force their way through it. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t.

		Most of the time it doesn’t. And no matter where you are in the screenwriting process, the first “words on paper” draft or the rewrite, it doesn’t take much to be overwhelmed by the writing process. We handle this kind of problem in many different ways, of course, like suddenly finding more “important” things to do, like cleaning the kitchen, going to the market, washing the dishes, or going to the movies. Whatever.

		After all, some parts of the story are more difficult than others. And some scenes need more work than others. After a few days of struggling with these particular pages, struggling with some of these thoughts and feelings, you may notice doubts about your abilities as a writer beginning to surface. You may find yourself thinking too much, asking yourself questions like: What am I going to do? How am I going to get back on track? You’ll question yourself, your talent, your ability to get the job done.

		Then one morning you’ll wake up and suddenly recognize that a heavy haze of uncertainty is hanging around your neck, and the feeling that’s been tugging at you for the last few days finally erupts like a volcano and you know you really don’t know what you are doing. You finally admit that you don’t know how to help yourself or where to go or what to do; the only thing that makes any sense at all is surrendering to the state you are in—dazed, lost, and confused.

		Welcome to the world of screenwriting.

		If you are writing a story and do not know what emotional forces are working on your character, it is very easy to “run up against the wall” and keep “going around in circles,” ultimately falling into that well known as writer’s block.

		Here’s the way it usually works: You’re totally immersed in the day-to-day process of screenwriting, but there may be one scene or sequence that does not work as well as it should, and you might begin to wonder why it’s not working. Still, it’s just a random thought and you probably don’t pay much attention to it. But you might become aware of a subtle shift occurring within yourself, maybe some doubts about why this scene or sequence is failing to come together. Then you might find that you’re talking to yourself, having a little conversation about “the Problem.” The first thing that usually happens is you start questioning yourself. “If I weren’t so stupid, I could do this,” you might think, and the more you wrestle with the problem, the more your image as a screenwriter begins to erode, and then you start making disparaging comments about yourself and your ability. That’s when you begin sliding into “the pit,” and soon the entire litany of negative judgments descends upon you.

		“I knew I should have stayed away from this subject,” you might think, or “I’m no good at writing.” Soon you’ll begin to expand and enlarge on your insecurities, thinking, “I don’t know whether I should be writing this script,” or “Maybe I just don’t have the talent to do this,” or “Maybe I should just find a partner and write it with someone else.” It goes on and on.

		But underneath all these thoughts, comments, or judgments you’re making is the common thread that somehow it’s all “your fault.” If you could do it, you would, and if you can’t, it’s because you don’t have the talent or ability to do it. In short, we turn it inside and blame ourselves.

		No wonder it’s called writer’s block.

		If you’re in this dilemma, and this veil of doubt and negativity is smothering your creative voice, then it’s time to give the critic a voice. That means giving that judgmental, critical, and negative voice that’s roaming around inside your head the opportunity to speak his or her mind.

		Remember that this is one of those common problems that strike fear in the hearts of screenwriters everywhere. I recall a screenwriting student coming into class one night with a strange and somewhat tortured look on her face. When I asked her what was wrong, her eyes welled up with tears and she became very serious, and said, “I don’t know where I’m going. I’m totally lost, I’m confused, and my pages stink. All that’s happening is talk, talk, talk. I keep going around in circles, and I don’t know what to do. I’m so upset I could cry.”

		It’s a universal problem. How you get out of it varies from person to person, script to script, but the first thing to do is to admit you have a problem and that it’s not going to go away until you deal with it, confront it head-on. That’s just one of the truths of life.

		In my student’s case she was so close to the material she couldn’t see it anymore, so the first thing I wanted her to do was just stop writing. When you reach this kind of crisis point, you’re so overwhelmed and frustrated that you have to regroup. Just stop writing. Put down your pen and paper, shut off your computer or tape recorder, however you’re working, and spend some time contemplating your story: What is the story about? What is the dramatic need of your main character? How are you going to resolve the story line? The answers to these questions are the key to getting back on track.

		First, go to your screenplay pages and take out a separate piece of paper and label it The Critic’s Page. As you start writing the script, every time you become aware of a negative comment, thought, or judgment, just write it down on The Critic’s Page. Number the comments, label them, just as if you were keeping a journal or making a shopping list. You might become aware of such comments as “These pages are terrible,” or “I don’t really know what I’m doing,” or “This isn’t working,” or “Maybe somebody else should finish it for me”; maybe “These characters all sound the same” and it’s apparent that “I’ve lost my vision,” and so on. Whatever your thoughts and comments are about your pages, just write them down on The Critic’s Page.

		The first day you’re doing The Critic’s Page, you may write two pages of screenplay and four pages of critical comments. On the second day maybe you’ll write three pages of screenplay and two or more pages on The Critic’s Page. The third day maybe you’ll do four or five pages of screenplay and a couple of pages of the critic.

		At this point, stop writing. The next day, take the critic’s pages, put them in order, and read them: all your negative comments for day one, day two, day three. As you think about these comments, mull them over in your mind. As you look these pages over, you’ll discover something very interesting: The critic always says the same thing. It doesn’t matter what kind of scene it is, or who the characters are, or what you write; whether it’s the pages from day one, two, or three, whether it’s a dialogue scene or an action scene, the critic always says the same thing—uses the same words, the same phrases, the same expressions. It’s all the same. Your pages are no good; they stink. No matter what you write, this is what your critic is telling you: The pages are no good; you should be doing something else.

		That’s the nature of the mind: to judge, to criticize, to evaluate. The mind can be either our best friend or our worst enemy. It’s so easy to get plugged into our judgments and evaluations of what’s right or wrong, good or bad.

		Now, it could be that what the critic says is accurate. Maybe the pages are terrible, the characters are thin and one-dimensional, and you are going around in circles. So what? Confusion is the first step toward clarity. What you try that doesn’t work will always show you what does work. As you struggle through your problem area, just get something down on paper; just write lousy pages. You’ll always be able to go back and make them better. That’s the process all writers go through. So what if you’ve “hit a wall” and are going around in circles, dazed, lost, and confused.

		Give the critic a voice. If you don’t give the critic a voice, it’ll turn inside and begin to fester, getting worse and worse until it bursts. It’s easy to let yourself become your own victim.

		Until you become aware of the critic’s voice running around in the back of your mind, you’re going to become a victim of that voice. Recognizing and acknowledging that voice is the first step through the block; it’s not necessary to act upon, or make a decision about, the judgments and evaluations the critic makes, or to determine whether the critic is right or not. No matter what stage you are at in the writing process, don’t get too serious about what the critic tells you. One of the things we have to accept is that we always get lost within the maze of our own creations. And we are our own worst critics.

		Writer’s block is a powerful enemy and can hammer you into submission; the mere thought of writing will turn you off, and because you’re not writing you’ll feel guilty, so whenever you sit down to write you’ll suddenly feel this blanket of heaviness settle over your head, causing you to lose all objectivity and fall into despair.

		Writer’s block. It happens all the time. To everybody.

		The difference is how you deal with it. How you see it.

		There are two different ways to look at this “problem.” One is to see your dilemma as a real problem, a real block, something to “overcome” or “break through,” a physical and emotional obstacle that is locking you into a creative straitjacket.

		That’s one way of looking at it.

		But there’s another way. And that is to see the ordeal as part of the writer’s experience. After all, it’s universal, everybody goes through it; it’s nothing new or unusual. If you recognize and acknowledge that, you’ve reached a creative crossroads. The realization becomes a creative guide to another level of your screenwriting craft. If you can look at it as an opportunity, you will find a way to strengthen and broaden your ability to create characters and story. You’ll see that maybe you need to go deeper into your story and strive for another level of richness, full of texture and dimension.

		“A man’s reach should exceed his grasp,” the poet Robert Browning wrote.

		If you understand that being challenged by writer’s block, being dazed, lost, and confused, is only a symptom, this “problem” becomes an opportunity to test yourself. And isn’t that what life is all about—putting yourself on the line in a situation where you test yourself to rise to another level? It’s simply an evolutionary step along the path of the screenwriting process.

		If you accept this point of view, it means you’re going to have to dig deeper into your material; you’re going to have to stop writing, go back into your character’s life and action, and define and clarify different elements of your character’s life. You’re going to have to go back and do new character biographies; to define or redefine the characters and their relationships to each other, which are, after all, the hub of your story line.

		If you’re working on a particular scene, for example, you may need to rewrite it, or change the points of view of your characters; you may need to change locations, or create new actions, episodes, or events for your character. Sometimes you may have to restructure the action in a particular scene or sequence by restructuring the entire act!

		Keep writing, day by day, page by page. The more you do the easier it gets. When you’re almost finished, perhaps ten or fifteen pages from the end, you might find you’re “holding on.” You might spend four days writing one scene or one page, and you’ll feel tired and listless. It’s a natural phenomenon; you simply don’t want to finish it, to complete it.

		Let it go. Just be aware that you’re holding on, then let it go. One day you’ll write “Fade Out,” or “The End”—and you’ll be done. It will be done.

		The art of screenwriting is finding places where silence works better than words. Recently, one of my students told me that after he had completed writing a scene, the thought occurred to him to go back and take another look at it. Something was bothering him about it and he didn’t know what it was. So he read and reread the scene, and suddenly understood how he could make it work more effectively with just two lines of dialogue! That’s good screenwriting. You don’t need pages and pages of dialogue to set up, explain, or move your story forward; just a few lines will do, if you enter the scene at the right point.

		And when you’ve completed the draft, it’s a time of celebration and relief. When it’s over, you’re going to experience all kinds of emotional reactions. First, there’s satisfaction and relief. A few days later, you’ll be down, depressed, and won’t know what to do with your time. You may sleep a lot. You’ve got no energy. This is what I call the “postpartum blues” period. It’s like giving birth to a baby: You’ve been working on something for a substantial period of time. It’s been a part of you. It’s gotten you up in the morning and kept you awake at night. Now it’s over. It’s natural to be down and depressed. The end of one thing is always the beginning of something else. Endings and beginnings, right?

		It’s all part of the experience of writing the screenplay.

		Adaptation


		 			NARRATOR:

			“The first time he saw Seabiscuit, the colt was walking through the fog at five in the morning. Smith would say later that the horse looked right through him: as if to say ‘What the hell are you looking at? Who do you think you are?’…He was a small horse [so] they made him a training partner to ‘better’ horses, forcing him to lose head to head duels to boost the confidence of the other animal…When they finally did race him, he did just what they had trained him to do…He lost.”

			—Seabiscuit

			Gary Ross





The story of Seabiscuit is a unique and inspirational one, not only for what the horse accomplished but for the way in which he accomplished it. During the second half of the 1930s, Seabiscuit became a cultural icon throughout the length and breath of the land. He was universally praised, his exploits and appeal so legendary that the very name “Seabiscuit” seemed to transcend the sport itself.

		But this was more than just a story of a physically and spiritually broken horse. With his extraordinary rise to fame, he became a symbol of hope; here was a story of three men and a horse striving for some kind of belief and faith to hold on to in the midst of the Great Depression. Seabiscuit became the object of the nation’s faith, someone to root for, something we could believe in. As a horse, he was not much to look at—he was small and had short legs—but he was blessed with an indomitable will that remained intact even after he spent two entire seasons floundering in the lowest ranks of horse racing.

		That all changed when the horse came under the forcefully gentle and patient leadership of Tom Smith, a man who personified the freedom of the frontier and preferred the company of horses to that of men. Red Pollard, Seabiscuit’s jockey, had been abandoned by his parents as a boy, and for years was a failing jockey who barely survived. Charles Howard was a self-made millionaire who lost the only thing he really loved and lived for, his young son.

		Taken together, these three men and a horse were emotionally shattered in their search for unity and wholeness. When they joined together, they fulfilled a need in one another: Charles Howard became the father figure, Tom Smith the teacher, Red Pollard the jockey, the son, the doer; they became a team, a family, sharing their skills to forge the legend known the world over as Seabiscuit. As Red says at the end of the movie: “You know, everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him, but we didn’t….He fixed us. Every one one of us. And, I guess in a way, we kind of fixed each other too.”

		Gary Ross adapted Seabiscuit from a best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand and turned it into an original screenplay based on the life and exploits of the legendary racehorse. As a screenplay adapted from a book, it honored the original source material both in terms of spirit and integrity. It is a moving, inspirational cinematic experience that captures the essence of the legendary horse. When I first read the book I loved it—it was an exciting, informative experience—and I wondered if Gary Ross, the writer-director, would be able to take such broad, sweeping historical events and fuse them into a poignant, gripping story line.

		What makes this adapted screenplay so good? And what’s the best way to go about adapting a novel, play, magazine article, or newspaper story into a screenplay?

		There are many ways, of course. When you adapt a novel or any source material into a screenplay, you must consider your work an original screenplay based on other material. You can’t adapt a novel literally and have it work, as Francis Ford Coppola learned when he adapted F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. Coppola—the noted filmmaker of The Conversation, The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, among many other great works—is one of the most arresting and dynamic writer-directors in Hollywood. In adapting The Great Gatsby he wrote a screenplay that is absolutely faithful to the novel. The result is a visually magnificent failure; dramatically, it didn’t work at all.

		Adaptation is both a skill and a challenge. The verb to adapt means “to transpose from one medium to another.” Adaptation is defined as the ability “to make fit or suitable by changing, or adjusting”—modifying something to create a change in structure, function, and form. It only starts with the novel, book, play, article, or song. That is the source material, the starting point—nothing more. It is a singular art. Adapting an existing work, whether a novel, play, magazine article, newspaper story, or biography into a medium such as a screenplay is difficult, to say the least. Just ask Charlie Kaufman, who wrote Adaptation, a film that chronicles the struggle of a screenwriter trying to adapt a novel about orchids into some kind of cinematic experience. Not many can do adaptations well. Each form is so different from any other that any adaptation has to be approached as an original screenplay.

		As mentioned earlier, in a novel the dramatic action of the story, the narrative line, is usually told through the eyes of the main character; the reader knows his/her thoughts, feelings, memories, hopes, and fears. There may be chapters written from other characters’ points of view, but the dramatic action usually occurs inside the main character’s head, within the mindscape of dramatic action.

		The screenplay, of course, is different; it is a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure. Film, when you get right down to it, is behavior.

		Words and pictures; apples and oranges.

		Every screenwriter approaches the craft of adaptation differently. Alvin Sargent, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of Ordinary People, Spider-Man 2, and Julia, among other films, reads the source material as many times as it takes to “make it his own,” until it’s his story. Then he writes individual scenes in a random fashion, lays them all together on the floor, and shapes a story line out of those individual scenes.

		Ted Tally, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of The Silence of the Lambs and The Juror, says he “breaks down the book scene by scene. I try to establish the structural line of events; this event happens, then this event, then this and this happens. What’s important from the book is what sticks in your mind. So I put those scenes on cards, one by one, just getting the story down, concentrating on the main needs of the adaptation.”

		The first thing Tally does is determine who the story is about, and anything that does not serve the main character needs to be cut. When you’re adapting a book that may be 350 or more pages into a screenplay that’s only 120 pages, you have to be ruthless, yet maintain the integrity of the source material. Which is what Gary Ross did in Seabiscuit. Not only did he have to capture the tone and temper of the times, but he wove action that occurred over many years into a two-hour-plus movie, yet still remained true to the source material. And within the historical context of the times, he had to set up the lives of three men, as well as that of Seabiscuit, then structure their journey as they overcame obstacle after obstacle to achieve their success on both a personal and professional level.

		It’s a general rule that if you’re adapting a book or an article to fit the needs of a screenplay, you may have to shift, omit, or add scenes in order to follow the main story line.

		“The last thing you’re concerned with,” Tally says, “is invention for its own sake. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Meaning that if scenes work within the context of the screenplay, don’t change them. If you can’t use scenes in the book, you may have to create new ones to make the film work on a visual level, not a literary one. Remember that when you’re deliberately breaking a book apart in order to make it into a screenplay, you’re going to have to invent new scenes, or invent a way to meld two or three scenes from the novel into one scene in the screenplay. And that means you’re going to have to invent transitions to keep the action moving forward. And then you’re going to have to invent dialogue for those transitions because you’ve sacrificed so much information, the story could be confusing.

		“You can’t be a slave to the book,” Tally continues. What he means is that you want the narrative flow in your head, but you don’t want it oppressing you. Often during the writing process you’ll reference your own story outline more than the novel. And once you complete your first draft, you’ll have no reference to the published novel at all. The screenplay becomes only about itself. An adaptation starts to develop its own logic and meaning once you’re writing the screenplay.

		The hub of adaptation is finding a balance between the characters and the situation, yet keeping the integrity of the story. If you want to see a great adaptation, read Seabiscuit, then watch the movie, and notice the skill with which Gary Ross captured the integrity and inspiration of the source material.

		Brian Helgeland adapted Dennis Lehane’s novel Mystic River for Clint Eastwood, and he talks about some of the challenges he had adapting the book into a screenplay. He read the book first: “Once. To get a sense of it. Then I read it another two or three times. I make all the notes in the book itself. Highlight things. Write in the margins. Cross pages out that I don’t need. Finally, I start sticking pieces of paper in there and break it down. Once I have the essence of what it’s all about, I type an outline. That’s when I’ll start to add scenes or combine them. Move things around.

		“Part of the trick of adaptation is trying to find a workable way of externalizing the book’s interior monologues. Sometimes it came down to taking the thoughts and turning them into dialogue.”

		This is one of the common challenges writers have when they approach an adaptation. I talked with Stuart Beattie, the gifted young writer of Collateral, after he had just completed adapting a novel into a screenplay.

		I asked how he approached the adaptation. The film, adapted from the novel Derailed by James Siegel, is “a thriller novel,” he began, “about an ordinary guy who has an affair and his wife gets incredibly derailed as a result of this one moment of weakness. So, there’s a morality aspect to it, very much a Hitchcockian kind of everyday man who is put into an extraordinary circumstance. The character keeps trying to get out of it, but just gets deeper and deeper into the situation.

		“When I first read the book I was literally on the edge of my seat,” he continued. “It was a four-hundred-page book and about three hundred pages into it I knew it would make a great film. Then this incredible hundred-eighty-degree plot twist occurs. You know, it’s one of those ‘don’t do’ rules of screenwriting. You just ‘don’t do’ things like putting in an unexpected plot twist at the end.

		“Even though I had to get rid of the last third of the book,” he said, “the drama is in the family. The girl has type one diabetes. The mother and father are saving up for this new drug that’s coming out which would basically save her life. She has a dialysis machine every night that’s strung out in the second mortgage payments. They’re all in stress. Not connecting anymore. Wrapped up in the pain of the dilemma. That kind of hellhole. So it sets up the situation of him walking out of the marriage. That’s basically the set-up. It starts out like it’s going to be a family drama, then twists around violently at the end of the Act I, then twists around again and again.”

		I asked how many times he read the material before he began writing the screenplay. “Two or three times,” he told me. “The first time through is the most important, because that’s the time you’re getting it. I’ll write ‘good scene, good line, good moment, or something like this could be an opening scene,’ that kind of stuff, not knowing where everything’s going. Then you’ve got to let it go and make the movie out of it. And then, a few weeks before shooting, we go back to the book and see if there’s anything that’s been dropped along the way: a line, a moment, something like that.

		“I don’t do a very detailed outline after I read the book two or three times. I do a beat sheet. Around a two- or three-page beat sheet. Like, ‘the scene in the car, the scene in the elevator, the scene in the house, the scene at the doctor’s, and so on.’ In a screenplay, I’ll normally do a ten-page outline. And usually I try to get that down to a five-page outline. Getting it down to five pages, I’ve got Act I on page one, Act III on page five…that just works for me.”

		When you approach a historical adaptation, like Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier’s National Book Award–winning novel about the physical and spiritual survival of two lovers at the end of the Civil War, there are other challenges. Anthony Minghella approached the adaptation with the underlying motif of a journey home. It has the main characters, a dramatic and emotional journey, a dramatic purpose, a series of obstacles, a woman waiting with hope and patience, and a place that resides in Inman’s heart that represents Cold Mountain. In a time when brothers were fighting brothers and lovers were torn from each other’s arms, Cold Mountain becomes a symbol of love, a spiritual place that resides within the heart. It represents not only the physical journey that Inman, the Rebel soldier, endures to return home, but his spiritual journey as well. Survival is uncertain, the wages of war affecting all who walk its path. The entire story is about the return from war and the effects of war’s brutality and chaos on the world away from the battlefield.

		Minghella departed from the novel, shortening and condensing it, yet kept the obstacles of the journey intact. In the novel, Inman, after enduring test after test of valor, courage, and loyalty, returns home to Cold Mountain and finds his love. And a single night becomes all the time they have together.

		There may be times in your adaptation that you have to add new characters, drop others, create new incidents or events, perhaps alter the entire structure of the book. In Julia, Alvin Sargent created an entire movie out of an episode from Pentimento by Lillian Hellman. In The English Patient, the entire movie was conceived from what seems to be only a few paragraphs in the novel. And then Anthony Minghella did some twenty-seven rewrites of the material on paper and in the editing room, shaping it into what became the final film.

		The source material and the screenplay are usually two different narrative forms; think apples and oranges. When you adapt a novel, play, article, or even a song into a screenplay, you are changing one form into another. You are writing a screenplay based on other material. In essence, however, you are writing an original screenplay. And you have to approach it that way.

		This is what Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens had to deal with in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The source material for The Two Towers is Volume Two of the Trilogy. Books III and IV comprise The Two Towers.

		The Two Towers novel opens with Book III, the death of Boromir, which was the dramatic climax at the end of the first film, The Fellowship of the Ring. In the next few chapters, we read how Aragorn and the others ride to Rohan, then follow the adventures of Merry and Pippin, who manage to escape the Orcs, leading to their fateful meeting with Treebeard. Then Gandalf returns as Gandalf the White. Then we move to Rohan, where Aragorn and the Fellowship convince King Théoden to retreat to Helms Deep, and it’s there, in Chapter 7 of Book III of The Two Towers, halfway through the book, that the battle rages between the Orcs and the Fellowhip at Helms Deep. The next four chapters deal with the continuation of the journey. At the end of Book III, Gandalf and Pippin race to Minas Tirith.

		Chapter I of Book IV begins as we pick up the action of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their journey to Mordor, and then each new chapter follows them through their obstacles and adventures on their way to Mount Doom.

		In approaching this book, it would not be very effective, at least dramatically, to structure the screenplay based on the progression of events as they occur in Books III and IV. You would have two different films: one about the Fellowship, the other about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. In film, you have to keep the story moving forward, and the best way to do that is by intercutting the events between the main characters, then weaving the narrative line of action through the story, like weaving a particular thread through the canvas of a tapestry; the story line always has to keep moving.

		“We had the event story, which we grappled with,” Philippa Boyens said, “and the ongoing process of whose story we were following at any one time, and the emotional through line of the story, of characters and how they were woven together and connected to the whole—all of the things that every screenwriter grapples with.”

		“The ring is a metaphor for the machine, for the way that a piece of metal controls and dictates what you do,” Peter Jackson says. “A lot of Lord of the Rings is about protecting your freedom and the fight against enslavement….Our first and foremost responsibility was as filmmakers, so we didn’t set out with a feeling that we had to be faithful to everything that Tolkien wrote….The central story line is obviously the story of a hobbit who comes into possession of this very dangerous ring, which he learns has to be destroyed, so he has to go on this journey to destroy it. That’s the spine of The Lord of the Rings, and we were fairly ruthless right at the beginning with any characters or any events that didn’t either directly or indirectly serve that spine.”

		When the writers approached the material to adapt The Two Towers into the screenplay, they took the events as they occurred in the novel and crafted them into a cohesive story line, intercutting Frodo, Sam, and the Gollum’s story with Aragorn, the Fellowship, and Merry and Pippin’s journey with Treebeard. Then they took the battle at Helms Deep that occurs in Chapter 7 of Book III, and used this as the exciting and rousing climax to end the film. In many ways I think adapting this book into the screenplay of Two Towers was a major feat in creative storytelling.

		There are times, however, when an adaptation takes on its own life. Perhaps the most unique example of this is the script written by John Huston for The Maltese Falcon. Huston had recently finished adapting the script of High Sierra, with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino, from the book by W. R. Burnett. The film was very successful, and Huston was given the opportunity to write and direct his first feature. He decided to remake The Maltese Falcon, by Dashiell Hammett. The Sam Spade detective story had been filmed twice before by Warner Bros., once as a comedy in 1931 with Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels, and again in 1936 as Satan Met a Lady, with Warren William and Bette Davis. Both films failed.

		Huston liked the feel of the book. He thought he could capture its integrity on film, making it a hard-boiled, gritty detective story in tune with Hammett’s style. Just before he left on a vacation, he gave the book to his secretary and told her to go through it, breaking down the written narrative into screenplay form, labeling each scene as either interior or exterior, and describing the basic action using dialogue from the book. Then he left for Mexico.

		While he was away, the secretary’s notes somehow found their way into the hands of Jack L. Warner. “I love it. You’ve really captured the flavor of this book,” he told the startled writer/director. “Shoot it just as it is—with my blessing!”

		Huston did just that, and the result is an American film classic.

		If you’re adapting historical events into a screenplay, the term “based on a true story” invokes its own series of challenges.

		In All the President’s Men, adapted by William Goldman from the book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (about Watergate, lest we forget), there were several dramatic choices that had to be made immediately. In an interview, Goldman says it was a difficult adaptation. Why? Because “I had to approach very complicated material in a simple way without making it seem simple-minded. I had to make a story where there wasn’t one. It was always a question of trying to figure out what the legitimate story was.

		“For example, the movie ends halfway through the book. We made a decision to end it there, on the Haldeman mistake, rather than show Woodward and Bernstein going on to their greater glory. The audience already knew they had been proven right and gone on and gotten rich and famous and were the media darlings. To try and end All the President’s Men on an upbeat note would have been a mistake. So we ended it there, on the Haldeman mistake, a little more than halfway through the book. The most important thing about the screenplay was setting up the structure. I had to make sure we found out what we wanted to find out when we wanted to find it out. If the audience is confused, we’ve lost them.”

		Goldman opens with the break-in at the Watergate Complex, a taut, suspenseful sequence, and after the capture of the men responsible, he introduces Woodward (Robert Redford) at the preliminary hearing. He sees the high-class attorney in the courtroom, becomes suspicious, then involved. When Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) joins him on the story (Plot Point 1), they succeed in unraveling the thread of mystery and intrigue that leads to the downfall of the President of the United States.

		When he wrote Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Goldman stated, “Western research is dull, because most of it’s inaccurate. The writers that write Westerns are in the business of perpetuating myths that are false to begin with. It’s hard to find out what really happened.”

		Goldman spent eight years researching Butch Cassidy, and occasionally he would find “a book or some articles or a piece about Butch. There was nothing about Sundance; he was an unknown figure until he went to South America with Butch.”

		Goldman found it necessary to distort history to get Butch and Sundance to leave the country and go to South America. These two outlaws were the last of their breed. Times were changing, and the Western outlaw could no longer pull the same kind of jobs he’d been doing since the end of the Civil War.

		“In the movie,” Goldman says, “Butch and Sundance rob some trains, then a superposse forms and chases them relentlessly. They jump off a cliff when they find out they can’t lose them, and go to South America. But in real life, when Butch Cassidy heard about the superposse, he took off. He just left. He knew it was the end; he couldn’t beat them…

		“I felt I had to justify why my hero leaves and runs away, so I tried to make the superposse as implacable as I could so the audience would be rooting for them to get the hell out of there.

		“Most of the movie was made up. I used certain facts. They did rob a couple of trains, they did take too much dynamite and blow the car to pieces, the same guy Woodcock was on both trains, they did go to New York, they did go to South America, they did die in a shoot-out in Bolivia. Other than that, it’s all bits and pieces, all made up.”

		“History,” as T. S. Eliot once observed, “is but a contrived corridor.” If you are writing a historical screenplay, you do not have to be accurate about the decisions or emotions of the people involved; but you do have to honor the historical events and the results of those events.

		Adapting a sequel poses another kind of creative challenge. “If it works well,” the old Hollywood adage goes, “do it again.” Films like the Rocky series, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Aliens, Shrek, and the Terminator films all pose individual problems.

		For my book Four Screenplays, I had the opportunity of talking with James Cameron about Terminator 2: Judgment Day and the challenge of writing a sequel to the very popular Terminator. Cameron went on to do True Lies and Titanic, the most successful film of all time, and is now exploring the vast terrain of documentaries as well as new feature projects. When I asked him how he approached writing the Terminator sequel, he told me it had to be conceived as an original screenplay based on other material. “From a writing standpoint,” he said, “the things that interested me the most were the characters. The tricky part was having it all make sense to a member of the audience who didn’t remember or hadn’t seen the first Terminator. Basically, I had a character popping onto the screen in a certain way, and therefore had to create a backstory for that character. I told myself I had to write the script just like there had never been a first film. The sequel had to be a story about someone who encountered something nobody else believes, like the opening scene of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where Kevin McCarthy swears he’s seen something shocking, and nobody believes him; then he starts telling the story.

		“In Terminator 2, the first time we meet Sarah, she’s locked up in a mental institution, but the real question is, Is she crazy? Has the past ordeal made her nuts? I wanted to push her character very far.

		“I knew the ‘bad guy being the hero’ could get me into some pretty dangerous territory,” he said, “both morally and ethically. I thought there must be a way to deflect this image of bad guy as hero, and use what’s great about the character.”

		The dramatic need of the Terminator is to terminate, to kill anybody or anything that gets in his way. Because he is a cyborg, a computer, he cannot change his nature; only a human or another robot can change the program. So to change the bad guy into a good guy requires changing the dramatic situation, the circumstances surrounding the action.

		“The key was the kid,” Cameron explained. “Because it’s never really explained why John Connor has such a strong moral template. For me, John was pushed by the situation when he sees the Terminator almost shoot the guy in the parking lot. I think everybody invents their own moral code for themselves, and it usually happens in your teens based on what you’ve been taught, what you’ve seen in the world, what you’ve read, and your own inherent makeup.

		“John Connor intuitively knows what’s right but can’t articulate it,” Cameron continued. “John says, ‘You can’t go around killing people,’ and the Terminator says, ‘Why not?’ And the kid can’t answer the question. He gets into a kind of ethical, philosophical question that could go on and on. But all he says is ‘You just can’t.’

		“What is it that makes us human?” Cameron asks. “Part of what makes us human is our moral code. But what is it that distinguishes us from a hypothetical machine that looks and acts like a human being but is not?”

		So Cameron changed the context of the sequel to make an emotional shift; he turned a killing machine into the protector of young John Connor, the future leader of the rebels. Because he’s now the “protector,” he must obey the boy’s command that it’s not “right” to kill anybody. Why it’s not right is something the Terminator has to figure out on his own. Basically, the Tin Man gets a heart. It works totally within the context of the sequel and is one of the things that make Terminator 2: Judgment Day so successful.

		What about adapting a play into a screenplay? Same principles. It’s a different form, but it’s got to be approached in the same manner. There is the proscenium arch, where the stage, the background, the sets, are forever fixed within the restrictions of that arch. The audience becomes the “fourth wall,” and during the performance we eavesdrop on the characters and their situation. We hear their thoughts, feelings, and emotions; we hear the narrative thrust of the story line. But the real action of the play occurs in the words the characters speak, through the language of dramatic action. Talking heads.

		There was a time in Shakespeare’s career when he cursed the restrictions of the stage. In Henry V, he lamented the stage as “an unworthy scaffold” and “this wooden O.” He begged the audience to “eke out the performance with your mind.” He knew the stage couldn’t begin to capture the vast spectacle of two armies stationed against an empty sky on the rolling plains of England. Only when he completed Hamlet did he transcend the limitations of the stage and create great stage art.

		In order to adapt a play into a screenplay, you’ve got to visualize some of the events that are referred to or spoken about. A play deals with language and dramatic dialogue. In A Streetcar Named Desire or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof by Tennessee Williams, or Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, or Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night, the action takes place onstage, in sets, the actors talking to themselves or each other. Take a look at any play, whether it’s a play by Sam Shepard, like Curse of the Starving Class, or Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? or any one of Ibsen’s masterpieces.

		Because the action of a play is expressed through the spoken word, you’ve got to open it up visually. You might have to add scenes or dialogue that are only referred to in the text, then structure, design, and write them in such a way that they lead you into the main scenes that occur on stage. Search the dialogue for ways to expand the action visually.

		Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman offers a good example of taking dialogue from a play and using it as an opportunity to see an incident as it happens. There is a scene in which Willy Loman approaches his boss, the son of the man he has worked for for nearly thirty-five years. His “American dream” now shattered and in pieces, Willy has come to ask the man if he can give up the road, literally his way of life, and work in the main office. But Willy Loman is a salesman, and he doesn’t know anything else.

		Willy asks Howard, the son, for a job on the floor. First he asks for $65 a week, then he drops his request to $50 a week, and then, in a final humiliation, he is literally forced to beg for $40 a week. But this “is a business, kid, and everybody’s gotta pull his own weight,” Willy is told, and Willy Loman’s sales figures have not been the best lately. Willy responds by retreating into his memory, telling Howard what drew him to become a salesman. “When I was a boy…eighteen, nineteen,” he says, “I was already on the road. And there was a question in my mind as to whether selling had a future for me….”

		He pauses for a long moment, then continues. “[That’s when] I met a salesman in the Parker House….His name was Dave Singleman. And he was eighty-four years old, and he’d drummed merchandise in thirty-one states. And old Dave, he’d go up to his room, y’ understand, put on his green velvet slippers—I’ll never forget—and pick up his phone and call the buyers, and without ever leaving his room, at the age of eighty-four, he made his living. And when I saw that, I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want. ’Cause what could be more satisfying than to be able to go, at the age of eighty-four, into twenty or thirty different cities, and pick up a phone, and be remembered and loved and helped by so many different people? Do you know? when he died—and by the way he died the death of a salesman, in his green velvet slippers in the smoker of the New York, New Haven and Hartford, going into Boston—but when he died, hundreds of salesmen and buyers were at his funeral.”

		That’s Willy Loman’s dream; that’s what drives him to get up every morning and hit the road, and when that dries up, the dream is dead and life is not worth living. That’s something we can see if we’re adapting a play into a film. Remember Andy Dufrense’s line in The Shawshank Redemption? “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” But if the dream collides with reality, as it does in the case of Willy Loman, and all hope is lost, then what’s left? The death of a salesman.

		The play and the film each stands on its own, a tribute to both playwright and filmmaker.

		Suppose you’re adapting a person’s life into a screenplay. Biographical screenplays dealing with people, either alive or dead, must be selective and focused in order to be effective. If you want to write a biographical script, the life of your character is only the beginning. Amadeus, for example, written by Peter Shaffer, deals with only a few incidents in the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his relationship with Antonio Salieri.

		Choose only a few incidents or events from your character’s life, then structure them into a dramatic story line. Gandhi (John Briley) tells the story of this modern-day saint by focusing on three stages in Gandhi’s life: first, when he was a young law student and experienced how the British enslaved India; second, when he began to practice his philosophy of nonviolent protest; and third, when he tried to bring peace between the Muslims and Hindus. Lawrence of Arabia (Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson) and Citizen Kane are other examples of selecting only a few incidents in a character’s life, then structuring them in dramatic fashion.

		A few years ago, one of my students obtained the motion picture rights to the life of the first woman editor on a major metropolitan newspaper. She tried to get everything into the story—the early years, “because they were so interesting”; her marriage and children, “because she had such an unusual approach”; her early years as a reporter when she covered several major stories, “because they were so exciting”; then getting the job of editor, because “that’s what she’s famous for.”

		I tried to persuade her to focus on only a few events in the woman’s life, but she was too involved with the subject to see anything objectively. So I gave her an exercise. I told her to write her story line in a few pages. She came back with twenty-six pages, and was only halfway through her character’s life! She didn’t have a story, she had a chronology, and it was boring. I told her it wasn’t working, and suggested she focus on one or two of the stories in the editor’s career. A week later, she came back saying she had been unable to choose which stories were the right ones. Overwhelmed by indecision, she became despondent and depressed and finally gave up in despair.

		She called me a few days later in tears, and I urged her to get back into the material, to choose three of the most interesting events in the woman’s life (writing, remember, is choice and selection), and if need be to talk to the woman about what she thought were the most interesting aspects of her life and career. She did, and managed to create a story line based on the news item the woman covered that led to her appointment as the first woman editor. It became the hook, or basis, of the entire screenplay.

		You have only 120 pages to tell your story. Choose your events carefully so that they highlight and illustrate your script with good visual and dramatic components. The screenplay should be based on the dramatic needs of your story. Source material is, after all, source material. It is a starting point, not an end in itself.

		Journalists seem to have a difficult time turning an article or news story into a screenplay. Perhaps the reason is that the methods of constructing a dramatic story line in film are exactly the opposite of those in journalism.

		A journalist approaches his/her assignment by getting facts and gathering information, by doing text research and interviewing people related to the piece. Once journalists have all the facts, they can figure out the story. The more facts a journalist can collect, the more information he has; he can use some, all, or none of it. Once he’s collected the facts, he searches for the hook, or angle, of the piece, and then writes the story using only those facts that highlight and support the material.

		That’s good journalism. But the facts support the story in a screenplay; you might even say they create the story. In journalism, you go from the specific to the general; you collect the facts first, then find the story. In screenwriting, it’s just the opposite: You go from the general to the specific. First you find the story, then you collect the facts you need to make the story work.

		A well-known journalist was writing a screenplay based on a controversial article he had written for a national magazine. All the facts were at his disposal, but he found it extremely difficult to let go of these facts and dramatize the elements he needed to make a good screenplay. He got stuck in finding the “right” facts and the “right” details, and then couldn’t get beyond the first thirty pages of the screenplay. He got bogged down, went into a panic, then shelved what might have been a very good screenplay.

		He couldn’t let the article be the article, and the screenplay the screenplay. He wanted to be completely faithful to the source material, and it just didn’t work.

		Many people want to write a screenplay or teleplay based on a magazine or newspaper article. If you’re going to adapt an article into a screenplay, you’ve got to approach it from a screenwriter’s point of view. What’s the story about? Who’s the main character? What’s the ending? Is it about a man who is captured, tried, and then acquitted for murder, only for us to discover after the trial that he really is guilty? Is it about a young man who designs, builds, and races cars and becomes a champion? About a doctor finding a cure for diabetes? About incest? Who is the story about? What is it about? When you answer those questions, you can lay the story out in dramatic structure.

		There are legal issues if you want to adapt a screenplay or teleplay from an article or story. First of all, you must obtain permission to write the script: That means getting the rights from the people involved, negotiating with the author, or her agent, or the magazine or newspaper. In most cases, people are willing to cooperate in trying to bring their stories to the screen or TV. An entertainment attorney who specializes in these matters or a literary agent should be consulted if you’re serious about it.

		You might want to write the script or outline first, even knowing there’s no chance of selling it without obtaining the rights. Something attracted you to the material. What is it? Explore it. You might decide to write the script based on the article or story and then see how it turns out. If it’s good, you may want to show it to the people involved. If you don’t do it, you’ll never know how it would have turned out.

		The one rule for all screenwriters, whether they are doing adaptations or starting from scratch, is “Just keep writing,” as Stuart Beattie says. “The greatest thing you can do as a writer is to write and write and write. I often tell aspiring screenwriters that one of the most valuable commodities in Hollywood is cheap talent. That’s what you are as an aspiring writer. To think that breaking into the industry is impossible is wrong; people get in all the time. And your value as being cheap talent is a worthy one. Read all the great screenplays. Read Chinatown. Know it. And don’t give up.”

		Inspiring words, those.

		So, what is the fine art of adaptation?

		NOT being true to the original. A book is a book, a play is a play, an article is an article, a screenplay is a screenplay. An adaptation is always an original screenplay based on other material. They are just different forms.

		Like apples and oranges.

		 			Open a novel at random and read a few pages. Notice how the narrative action is described. Does it take place inside the character’s head? Is it told with dialogue? What about description? Take a play and do the same thing. Notice how the characters talk about themselves or the action of the play; talking heads. Then read a few pages of a screenplay (any that are excerpted in this text will do) and notice how the screenplay deals with external details and events, what the character sees.

		On Collaboration


		 			 				Col-lab-o-rate (ka lab’ a rāt) v.i. 1) to work, one with another; to cooperate, as on a literary work: They collaborated on a novel.

			—The Random House Dictionary





Jean Renoir was a man who loved film with a fervent, almost religious passion. He loved to talk about cinema, and there was no topic too large or too small for him. During the year I was under his tutelage, he shared his experience of the theater, art, acting, and literature and expounded upon the world of cinema. He insisted movies had the potential to be literature, but should never be considered a true “art.”

		When I asked what he meant by that, he replied that in his definition true “art” is the sole vision of one person, which in the scheme of the filmmaking process is not at all the case. He explained that one person can’t do everything required to make a movie. One person can write the screenplay, direct the film, star in it, photograph it, edit it, and score it, like Charlie Chaplin did, but, Renoir stated, the filmmaker cannot act all the parts, or record all the sound, or handle all the lighting requirements along with the vast myriad of other technical details required to make a movie. He can shoot the film but he can’t develop it; he has to send it to a special film laboratory for that, and sometimes it doesn’t come back the way he wants it, or sees it in his artistic vision.

		Because of his background and tradition, Renoir felt that film, though a great art, was never really a “true” art in the sense that writing, painting, or music is a “true” art, because too many people are directly involved in its making and outcome.

		“Art,” Renoir stated, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator. One person can’t do everything….True art is in the doing of it.”

		Film is a collaborative medium. The filmmaker depends on others to bring his or her vision to the screen. The technical skills required to make a movie are extremely specialized. And the state of the art is constantly improving. Just take a look at where we’ve come in the last decade in terms of computer graphic technology. Without James Cameron’s brilliant contribution to film technology in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, we would not have the computer “morphing technology” we have today. If we did not have that, we would not have had Jurassic Park; if we didn’t have Jurassic Park, we would not have had Forrest Gump; without Forrest Gump, we wouldn’t have had Toy Story, which then led to The Matrix, Finding Nemo, Shark Tale, The Polar Express, and The Incredibles.

		The revolution of today is the evolution of tomorrow.

		Film is both an art and a science. Sometimes a screenwriter’s vision forges the way into new scientific breakthroughs, like James Cameron did in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a film that to my mind is as revolutionary an innovation as the introduction of sound was in 1927. In other times and situations, a scientific invention is conceived that stimulates new ways of looking at something. Writer-director Kerry Conran’s Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a case in point. It will, in the near future, I think, revolutionize the craft of filmmaking. It literally brings filmmaking into the realm of the home computer, and in the not-too-distant future I can see young filmmakers learning their art and craft in the making of short films at home.

		There’s always a dynamic interchange between science, art, and technology in the evolution of the movies. If we believe in the future of cinema, we’re all like Jay Gatsby, chasing the “green light” that beckons us to the future.

		If we listen to the wisdom of Renoir, the only thing we can do by ourselves is write a screenplay. You don’t need very much: a computer, pen and paper, or a typewriter and a certain amount of time. Sometimes you may want to write alone, by yourself. But there are other times when you wish you could join forces with someone and write a screenplay together, meaning collaborate with someone.

		It’s a choice you make. It has both an upside and a downside.

		The upside of writing alone is obvious: There will be no one interfering with what you want to write and how you want to write it and when you want to write it. In other words, it is your vision and yours alone. There’s no one else getting in the way—at least at this stage. There’s a lot to be said for that.

		The downside of doing it on your own is also obvious: You’re alone in a room staring at the blank page or an empty computer screen, and there are moments when you don’t know what happens next, or what you want to say or how you want to say it. Sometimes, maybe a lot of the time, the dialogue sounds corny, contrived, and predictable; if it’s not happening the way you see it in your mind, the tendency is to turn your frustration, depression, and anger onto yourself and berate yourself for doing such a poor job. So you think the writing sucks, that you can’t do it, that it’s just not working, that you’re not good enough, that you don’t have the talent to do it, that the story is trite and banal, and who do you think you’re kidding anyway?

		You know the drill.

		Many times writers choose to join forces just to avoid those negative feelings and that uncertainty. Other times, necessity dictates collaboration. For Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens collaborated because “the writing part was related to how much time I had,” Peter Jackson said in an interview. “In the beginning, before we started shooting, we very much wrote the scripts together—we would sit in the same room and write scenes. I’d sit at the computer and type it in because I find, as the person who’s ultimately going to direct the film, that if I write the descriptive passages, it’s my first opportunity to imagine the film in my head. Fran works in longhand and writes the dialogue of the scene. Philippa does the same thing, but on her laptop. Then I sit down, take the dialogue, and write the descriptive passages around the dialogue. I’m thinking as a director, not as a screenwriter. Once I move into shooting, we’re revising the script as the film is being shot, but I can participate much less in the actual physical writing process. It becomes Philippa and Fran, and I react to them, or just say, ‘Yep, perfect.’ My collaboration as a member of the writing team becomes one much more based on feedback and suggesting ideas. Having said that, we did spend a lot of weekends working on script stuff, all the way through the shoot.”

		Sometimes a producer or production company has an idea and commissions you to develop it into a screenplay, and then you’re in collaboration with the producer and director. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example, Lawrence Kasdan (with only one screenwriting credit at the time, a rewrite of The Empire Strikes Back) met with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Lucas wanted to use the name of his dog, Indiana Jones, for the hero (Harrison Ford). The other thing he knew was that the last scene of the movie would be set in a vast military basement warehouse filled with thousands of crates of confiscated secrets, much as Citizen Kane’s basement was filled with huge crates of art. That’s all Lucas knew about Raiders at the time. Spielberg wanted to add a mystical dimension. The three men spent two weeks locked in an office, and when they emerged, they had worked out a general story line. Then Lucas and Spielberg left to work on other projects, and Kasdan went into his office and wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark.

		Writers collaborate for different reasons. There are times, at least on some projects, when screenwriters think it’s easier to work with someone else. Most television writers work in teams, and shows like Saturday Night Live, Desperate Housewives, or the CSI: Miami and CSI: New York shows have a staff of anywhere from five to ten writers working on each episode. A comedy writer has to be both gagman and audience—a laugh is a laugh. Only the gifted few like Woody Allen or Neil Simon can sit in a room alone and know what’s funny and what isn’t.

		When you decide to collaborate on a screenplay with someone, it’s important to distinguish the three stages of the collaborative process: (1), establishing the ground rules of the collaboration; (2), the preparation required to write the material; and (3), the actual writing itself. All three stages are essential. If you decide to collaborate, you’d better go into it with your eyes open. For example, do you like your potential collaborator? You’re going to be working with that person for several hours a day for several months, so you better enjoy being with him or her. Otherwise, you’re starting off with problems.

		Collaboration is a relationship. It’s a fifty-fifty proposition. Two or more people are joining together to create an end product, a screenplay or television show or whatever. That’s the aim, goal, and purpose of your collaboration, and that’s where all your energy should be directed. Collaborators tend to lose sight of that very quickly.

		Sometimes we get bogged down in “being right” and in the process engage in various ego struggles, so it’s best you ask yourself some questions before you begin. For example, why are you collaborating? Why is your partner collaborating? What’s the reason you’re choosing to work with somebody else? Because it’s easier? Safer? Not as lonely? Out of insecurity?

		What do you think collaborating with someone looks like? That is, what kind of mental picture do you have of the collaboration? Most people have a picture of one person sitting at a desk in front of a computer or typewriter, typing like crazy, while his or her partner paces the room rapidly, snapping out words and phrases like a party planner. You know, a “writing team.” A talker and a typist.

		Is that the way you see it? It may have been that way at one time, during the ’20s and ’30s when writing teams like Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman were turning out plays and movies, but it’s not that way anymore. Rather, it may be some kind of variation on what Peter Jackson did with his cowriters on Lord of the Rings.

		Everyone works differently. We each have our own style, our own pace, our own likes and dislikes. One of the best examples of what I think represents an ideal collaboration was the musical collaboration between Elton John and Bernie Taupin back in the ’70s. At the height of their musical fame, Bernie Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then fax them to Elton John, wherever he was around the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and finally record it.

		But that’s the exception, not the rule.

		If you want to collaborate, you must be willing to find the right way to work—the right style, the right methods, the right working procedure. I would suggest that you try out different things, make whatever mistakes you need to make, and just go through the collaborative process by trial and error until you find the best and easiest way for you and your partner to work together. After all, “the sequences you try that don’t work,” as my film editor friend said, “are the ones that show you what does work.”

		There are many choices in creating the ground rules of collaboration, how we go about working with each other. There really are no rules on how to collaborate; you get to create them and make them up as you go along. Just as in a marriage, you’ve got to create it, sustain it, and then maintain it. You’re dealing with someone else all the time. Collaboration is a fifty-fifty proposition, with an equal division of labor.

		There are four basic and equal positions in collaboration: writer, researcher, typist, and editor. No position is more important than another.

		What does your collaboration look like to you and your partner? What are your goals? Your expectations? What do you see yourself doing in the collaboration? What is your partner going to do? If need be, you might sit down with your proposed partner and write a two- or three-page free-association essay about how you both see your collaboration. Then trade pages; you read his and he reads yours, and you both see what you’ve got.

		Open up a dialogue. Who’s going to be sitting at the computer? Where are you going to work? When? Who’s going to do what? What’s the best time of day for the two of you to be working? Are you going to be working alone and then e-mailing the pages to your partner to edit, or vice versa? Or are you going to be in the same room at the same time?

		Talk about it. Discuss it.

		Lay down the ground rules that are best for both of you. What’s the division of labor? You might list the things that have to be done: two or three trips to the library, three or more interviews, etc. Organize and divide the tasks. I like to do this, so I’ll do this; you do that, and so on. Do things you like to do. If you like to use the library, do it; if your partner likes to interview people, let him or her do it. Or do it together, with your partner as the lead. It’s all part of the writing process. It’s how you utilize your resources.

		What does your work schedule look like? Do you both have full-time jobs? When are you going to get together? Where? Make sure it’s convenient for both of you. If you have a job or a family or are in a relationship, sometimes it can get difficult. Deal with it.

		Are you a morning person, an afternoon person, or an evening person? That is, do you work best in the morning, the afternoon, or the evening? If you don’t know, try it one way and see what happens. If it’s working, stay with it. If not, try it another way. See what works best for both of you. Support each other. You’re working for the same thing: the completed screenplay.

		You’ll need a couple of weeks simply to explore and organize a work schedule that supports both of you. This might be a good time for the two of you to get together and lay out the story line.

		Don’t be afraid to try something that doesn’t work. Just do it! Make mistakes. Create your collaboration by trial and error. And don’t plan on doing any serious writing until the ground rules are set.

		The last thing you’re going to do is write.

		Before you do that, you’ve got to prepare the material.

		What kind of story are you writing? Is it a contemporary story or a historical story? A period piece? If so, what period? What do you have to do to research it? Spend one or two days or several weeks at the library? Sit in on a legal proceeding? Whatever aspect of the research you do individually, once you enter it into the computer you can e-mail it to your partner. Again, collaboration is a fifty-fifty division of labor. In terms of developing the story, it’s best to work on the story together. Verbalize the story line in a few sentences. Create a subject of the screenplay, the action and the characters. Then break it down into genres: What kind of story are you writing? An action-adventure? Thriller? Love story? Drama? Romantic comedy? The first thing you have to be clear on is what kind of a story you’re writing. Where does the story begin and where does it end? What’s the action line? Who’s the main character? What’s it about? Is your story about an archeologist who uncovers ancient artifacts on a highway construction project? What is the dramatic need of your character? What kind of conflict are you going to be working with? Internal conflict—fears, emotions, loss of control—or external conflict: physical injury, an attack or war, the natural elements, survival? If you’re writing a mystery story, do you know who committed the crime and why? These are the very first things you need to know. Then you can build and construct your story line.

		Do you know the ending, the resolution of your story? Do you know the opening? Plot Points I and II? If you don’t, who does? Both of you have to know where you’re going so you can determine the best way of getting there.

		Who is your story about? Write character biographies. You may want to talk about each character with your collaborator, and then write one biography while your partner writes another. Or you may write the biographies and your collaborator edits them. Know your characters. Talk about them, about who they are and where they come from. Feed the pot. The more you put in, the more you can take out.

		After you do the character work, start building the story line on cards.

		Start laying out the story line; when you know the ending, the beginning, and Plot Points I and II, you’re ready to expand your story line in a scene progression using 3 × 5 cards. Discuss it. Talk about it. Argue about it. Just make sure you know your story. You may agree or disagree about certain parts of it; you may want it one way, your partner another. If you can’t resolve it, write it both ways. See which way works best. Work toward the finished product—the screenplay. Always serve the material.

		When you’re ready to write, things sometimes get crazy. Be prepared. How are you going to put it down on paper? What are the mechanics involved? Who says what, and why is that particular word better than this particular word? Who says so? It’s two sides of the same coin; I’m right and you’re wrong is a point of view. So is the other point of view: You’re wrong and I’m right.

		I’ve collaborated several times in my writing career, and each time it’s different. When I work with someone else on a project, I like to create a Mission Statement. What do we want to achieve or accomplish with the screenplay? For example, in my last screenplay, a science fiction epic adventure, my partner and I wanted to create an “engaging, edge-of-the-seat page-turner.” Then we made an agreement to “serve the material.”

		Then we got together and started throwing down cards for sequences. We knew the ending, beginning, and Plot Points I and II. We got together two, sometimes three times a week for a couple of weeks, and tossed out notes, bits of dialogue, ideas for certain moments and various sequences, and different ways of structuring them. After we’d worked on this part, we got together with a bunch of cards and begin writing down ideas for scenes and sequences. We just threw them down on the cards and didn’t worry about where they fit into the structure of the story line.

		We spent about three to six weeks preparing the material: doing the research, fleshing out the characters, building the story line, and creating the mechanics of the collaboration. It’s an interesting experience, because you’re creating another kind of relationship—magic at times, hell at others.

		Then, after we completed most of the preliminary work on the characters and story line, my partner, Jim, a special effects wizard, got called for a job he couldn’t refuse. It was a major Hollywood special effects film, Spider-Man 2, and we both knew he would be working ten to twelve hours a day on it. It was great for him, but not so good for our collaboration; we knew it would leave us with little writing time for our project. So we worked very hard organizing and building the story line and structuring the narrative through line so it would be tight before he started his new job.

		Once he felt established in his job and felt fairly secure in terms of deadlines and procedures, we checked in by phone at least once a week, and I began preparing some of the material and writing certain sequences based on the research we’d done, which I then e-mailed to him. Each weekend, he would go over the material I had sent, do some editing and revisions, then send it back to me. The rest of the time he spent with his family.

		After a few months, we finally started getting together on weekends and going over the material, figuring out how we’d write the first act. I had already written the opening sequence, the inciting incident, and he wanted to write Act I; he did, and when he finished it, he e-mailed it to me. I edited it and returned it to him, and he made whatever changes he wanted to make. In this way, we moved forward through the project. It took us much longer with him working on Spider-Man 2, but we kept the story line in our consciousness so that when his job was finished, almost six months later, it took us only about three weeks to complete the first draft of the screenplay. From that point on, we e-mailed pages back and forth, revised, added scenes, discussed suggestions, and so on until we completed our first draft. All in all, it took us over a year to do this first draft. Then we spent another three or four months rewriting.

		That was our collaboration. It worked fine once we established our work schedule and determined how we were going to work. But the thing we had to keep foremost in our minds at all times was how we could best serve the material. We didn’t let our egos get in the way over a line or a scene.

		If there’s a key principle in the experience of collaboration it’s to serve the material.

		Collaboration means working together.

		The key to collaboration—or any relationship, for that matter—is communication. You’ve got to talk to each other. Without communication, there’s no collaboration, only misunderstanding, anger, and disagreement. That’s nowhere. You are working together to write and complete a screenplay. There will be times when you’ll want to chuck it and just walk away. You might think it’s not worth it. You may be right, but usually it’s just some of your psychological “stuff” coming up—you know, all that “stuff” from the past that we have to contend with on a day-to-day basis: the fears, insecurities, guilt, judgments, and so on. Deal with it! Writing is a process in which you learn more about yourself. Be willing to make mistakes, and to learn from each other about what is working and what isn’t.

		It’s always good to work in thirty-page units of action. You write Act I, and your partner edits it. Your partner writes the first half of Act II, and you edit it. You write Act III, and your partner edits it. This way you see what your partner is writing and you alternate as an editor and writer in the same way that he or she does.

		Sometimes you have to criticize your partner’s work. How are you going to tell her that what she wrote is not working, that maybe it would be better if she starts over and rethinks the material? You’d better think about what you’re going to say. Realize you’ll be dealing with your partner’s reactions to your judgments. “Judge not lest ye be judged.” You’ve got to respect and support the other person, even if it means criticizing her work. It’s nothing personal, it just isn’t working the way it could be. So, what do you do? First determine what you want to say, then decide how to say it the best. If you want to say something, say it to yourself first. How would you feel if your partner told you what you’re going to tell her?

		As in marriage, the rules of collaboration are communication and surrender. After all, it’s all a learning experience.

		Sometimes changes have to be made in Act I before moving on to Act II. The process is exactly the same; writing is writing. Bring the material to a semirough stage, then move on. You can always polish it, so don’t worry about making your pages perfect. In other words, since you’re probably going to change it anyway, don’t worry about how good it is. It may not be very good. So what? Just get it down; then you can work on it to make it better.

		When the first act is done, and it’s fairly tight and a clean “words on paper” draft, sit down to read and edit it. Is it working? Do we need another scene here? Can I cut this scene? Does the dialogue have to be clarified? Expanded? Sharpened? Is the dramatic premise clearly staged? In both word and picture? Are we setting it up properly? At this point, you may add a few lines, change a few words or a scene here and there, and occasionally sketch in certain visual aspects.

		After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it in a drawer somewhere for a week or so, then go back and read it. See what you’ve got. You should be able to see it as a whole and obtain some kind of overview or perspective on the material. You might need to add some new scenes, create a new character, possibly telescope two scenes into one. Whatever you need to do, just do it!

		It’s all part of the writing process.

		If you’re married and want to collaborate with your spouse, other factors are involved. When things get difficult, for example, you can’t simply walk away from the collaboration. It’s part of the marriage. If the marriage is in trouble, your collaboration will only magnify what’s not working with it. You can’t be an ostrich and pretend a problem isn’t there. Deal with it.

		For example, some married friends of mine, both professional journalists, decided to write a screenplay together. She was in between assignments and he was in the middle of one, both for major magazines. She had time on her hands, so she decided to get a head start and began to research the story. She went to the library, read books, interviewed people, then entered the material. She didn’t mind, figuring “someone’s got to do it!”

		He had completed his assignment by the time the research was done. They took a few days off, then got down to work. The first thing he said was “Let’s see what you’ve got.” Then he proceeded to appraise the material as if it were his assignment and as if some unknown researcher, not his wife and collaborator, had done the work! She was angry, but said nothing. She had done all the work, and now he was going to come in and save the project!

		That’s how it began. It got worse. They hadn’t talked about how they were going to work together, only that they would. No ground rules had been established, no decisions made about who did what or when, and no work schedule had been set up.

		As a writer, she works in the morning and writes very fast, throwing words down quickly with lots of blank spaces, then goes back and rewrites the material three or four times until she feels it’s right. He, on the other hand, works best at night, writing slowly, crafting each word and phrase with delicate precision; his first draft is almost a final one.

		They are both professional writers, but when they made the decision to collaborate and actually began working together, they had no idea about what to expect. She had collaborated only once before, and he had never worked with another writer in this kind of situation. They both had expectations about what the other would do, but they didn’t communicate them to each other. After all, in a marriage, sometimes we take things for granted. And the cost, of course, is high.

		They adjusted their mind-sets, and after they had laid out the story, they established their schedule. It was decided that she would write the first act—which was the material she had researched—and he would write Act II.

		So, she got down to work. She was a little insecure, she told me—after all, it was her first screenplay—and she worked hard to overcome the resistance of the form that she soon encountered. She wrote the first ten pages and then, looking for some feedback, asked her husband to read them. She didn’t know if she was on the right track or not. Was she setting up the story correctly? Was it what they had discussed and talked about? Were the characters real people in real situations? Her concern was only natural.

		He was working on the second scene of Act II when she gave him the first ten pages. He didn’t want to look at them because he was having his own problems and was just beginning to find his style. The scene was a difficult one, and he’d been working on it for several days.

		He took the pages, then put them aside and went back to work, saying nothing to his wife. She gave him a few days to read the material. When he didn’t, she became angry, so he promised he would read it that night. That satisfied her, at least for the moment.

		She got up early the next morning. He was still sleeping, having worked late the night before. She made coffee and tried to work for a while. But it was no use. She wanted to know what her husband, her “collaborator,” thought about the pages she had written. What was taking him so long?

		The more she thought about it, the more impatient she became. She had to know. Finally, she made a decision; what he didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him. Quietly she crept into his office and softly closed the door behind her.

		She went to his desk and started riffling through his papers to see what comments, if any, he had made on her first ten pages. She finally found them, but there was nothing on them—no marks, no comments, no nothing. He hadn’t even read them! Angry, she started to read his pages to see what he was so hung up about.

		That’s when she heard the noise on the stairs. As she turned around the door was suddenly flung open and her husband stood framed in the doorway, yelling, “Get away from that desk!” She tried to explain, but he didn’t listen. He accused her of spying, of meddling, of invading his privacy. She erupted, and all the anger and tension and withheld communication came pouring out. They went at it, fighting tooth and nail, no holds barred. It all came out: resentment, frustration, fear, anxiety, insecurity. It was a screaming match; even the dog started barking. At the peak of their “collaboration” he picked her up bodily, dragged her across the floor, and literally threw her out of the office, slamming the door in her face. She took off her shoe and stood there pounding on the door. To this day, her heel marks are etched into his office door.

		Now they can laugh about it.

		It wasn’t funny then. They didn’t speak for days.

		They learned a great deal from the experience. They learned that fighting doesn’t work in collaboration. They learned to work together and communicate on a more personal and professional level. They learned to criticize each other in a positive and supportive way, without fear and restraint. They learned to respect each other. They learned to serve the material. They learned that every person has a right to his or her own writing style and that you can’t change it, only support it. She learned to respect the way he styles and fashions his words into polished prose. He learned to admire and respect the way she worked—fast, clean, and accurate, always getting the job done. They learned how to ask for help from each other, something that was difficult for both of them. In other words, they learned from each other, and supported each other in the same way that three men and a horse did in Seabiscuit.

		When they completed the screenplay, they felt a sense of satisfaction and achievement in what they had accomplished. They had learned to work together not only on a physical level, but on an emotional and spiritual level as well.

		Collaboration means “working together.”

		After It’s Written


		 			“Hollywood is the only place where you can die from encouragement.”

			—Dorothy Parker





What do you do with your screenplay after you’ve completed it?

		First, you’ve got to find out whether it “works” or not; whether you should engrave it in stone or paper the walls with it. You need some kind of feedback to see whether it’s working and whether you wrote what you set out to write.

		At this moment you may not really be sure whether it works or not. You can’t see it; you’re too close to it, lost in the maze of subjectivity.

		Of course, the first thing you need to do before you send it out to be read by a few close friends is to back up the screenplay, either on disk or hard copy. This may be obvious, but it bears stating the obvious. Keep the backup copy someplace it will be safe. If you only have the original printout version, and have not backed it up, never give that original to anyone. You have to have a copy of the script always available to you.

		I was recently retained as an expert witness in a lawsuit where the screenwriter had backed up his work only on his hard drive. He thought he was covered. When he began negotiations with a German production company on a coproduction deal, he printed out one copy and sent it off to Germany. After he sent the original hard copy, he wanted to install a DSL line so that he could e-mail his scripts with more speed and efficiency, so he hired the local phone company to install it. But the installer told him his hard drive was too full to install the line and that he had to clean it up first. Well, you can probably guess what happened. During the installation, the technician erased the entire hard drive and the writer had no backup, and because the German company had passed on the project, he had no hard copy. Basically, the writer had nothing. He had to start over, from page one, word one, and re-create the screenplay from scratch.

		Sound far-fetched? Of course, but it’s the truth. The moral of the story: Always back up your material.

		Now you’re ready to give a copy of your script to two friends, close friends, friends you can trust, friends who will tell you the truth, friends who are not afraid to tell you: “I hate it. What you’ve written is weak and unreal, the characters flat and one-dimensional, the story contrived and predictable.” Friends who will not be afraid to hurt your feelings.

		You’ll find that most people won’t really tell you the truth about your script. They’ll tell you what they think you want to hear: “It’s good; I liked it! I really did. You’ve got some nice things in it.” Or “I think it’s commercial,” whatever that means! People’s intentions are good, but they don’t realize they’re hurting you more by not telling you the truth, not telling you what they really think about it.

		Your name is going to be on the title page, so you want it to be the best script you can write. If you feel a suggestion can improve your screenplay, use it. Any changes you make in a rewrite must be made from choice, and you have to be comfortable with those changes. This is your story, and you’ll know instinctively whether the changes work or not.

		Which brings us to the subject of the rewrite. You know the adage “Writing is rewriting”; well, it’s true. The draft you send out into the marketplace is really three different drafts: the first “words on paper” draft; what I call “the mechanical draft”; and the third draft, “the polish.” This is the draft where most of the script gets written.

		After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it aside for a week. Then go back and reread the material from beginning to end in one sitting. Be sure to lock up all pens, pencils, and paper and to keep the computer turned off. You don’t want to take any notes as you read. You just want to read. When you go through the first “words on paper” draft, you’ll find yourself on the roller coaster of emotion. Some parts you think are terrible: The writing is poor, the story is all told in dialogue, the descriptions are too long, too thick, too cluttered, and what you’re reading feels weak, awkward, too direct, and just doesn’t work.

		Then you’ll read other pages that you think work okay. The dialogue is good, the action tight, and overall it seems to work pretty well. Then you’ll go back on the roller coaster again, alternating between the emotions of elation and depression.

		That’s good.

		After you’ve finished reading the script, put it away again. Now write three essays. The first essay, in free association, is to write what first attracted you to the material. Do this in two or three pages, more if you choose. Was it the character, the situation, the idea, or the action line that originally attracted you to the material? Just answer this question: What really attracted you to the material? Throw down your thoughts, words, and ideas. Don’t worry about grammar or punctuation. Write in fragments if you want to. When you’ve completed this first exercise, go on to the next.

		The second essay, also in free association, answers this question: What kind of a screenplay did you actually end up writing? You may have started to write a mystery-thriller with a strong love interest and ended up writing a love story with a strong mystery-thriller aspect. Many times, we’ll start out writing one kind of story only to end up writing another. For example, one of my students started out to write about the relationship of a day laborer to a woman above his class, and ended up writing about the relationship between the laborer and his brother when the woman comes between them. We want a clean, coherent narrative through line in the screenplay. Write this second essay in two or three pages.

		For the third essay: You saw what originally attracted you to the screenplay, and may have veered from this slightly while writing the first “words on paper” draft, so what you started out to do may be slightly different from what you ended up doing. In this third essay, you want to answer this question: What do you have to do to change what you did write into what you wanted to write? In other words, intention must equal result. In my student’s case, she had to go back to the beginning and establish and strengthen the relationship between the two brothers. Sometimes you’ll be happy with what you ended up with. Great! Other times you’ll have to make changes.

		When you’ve finished these three essays, think about what you have to do to strengthen and solidify your story line so your intention equals your result.

		Now read the first “words on paper” draft in units of dramatic action. Read Act I and make notes in the margins. Out of twenty or so scenes, you’ll find you can keep ten of them intact. Of the remaining ten, you may have to change the focus in five or six of them by rewriting dialogue and possibly adding some action, and you may see that the remaining five scenes don’t work at all. So, you’ll have to write five new scenes. All in all, you may have to change anywhere from 65 to 80 percent of Act I.

		Just do it. You’ve spent several months working on this script, so you want to do it right. If you sell your material, you’re no doubt going to have to make changes anyway, either for the producer, director, or star. Changes are changes; nobody likes them, but we all do them.

		In Hollywood, nobody tells you the truth, what they really think; they might tell you they like it, then add, “But it’s not something we want to do at the present time”; or “We have something like this in development,” or “We’ve already done this movie.”

		That’s not going to help you. You want feedback; you want someone to tell you what he or she really thinks about your script, so choose the people you give this first draft to carefully.

		After they’ve read it, listen to what they say. Don’t defend what you’ve written; don’t pretend to listen to what they say and leave feeling righteous, indignant, or hurt.

		See whether they’ve caught the “intention” of what you wanted to write about. Listen to their observations from the point of view that they might be right, not that they are right. They’ll have observations, criticisms, suggestions, opinions, and judgments. Are they right? Question them; press them on it. Do their suggestions or ideas make sense? Do they add to your screenplay? Enhance it? Go over the story with them. Find out what they like and dislike; what works for them and what doesn’t. At this point, you still can’t see your screenplay objectively. If you want another opinion “just in case,” be prepared to get confused. If you give it to four people, for example, they’ll all disagree. One person will like the holdup of the moon rocks, another won’t. One person will say he likes the holdup, but not the result of the holdup (the characters either get away or don’t); and the other one wonders why you didn’t write a love story.

		It doesn’t work. You want the initial feedback of two people you can trust. When you’ve incorporated their suggestions, then you can send it out into the market.

		Your script must be clean, neat, and professional-looking, meaning it’s got to be in correct industry format, with Courier 10 or 12 font. The form of your screenplay must be correct. Here’s where a software program like Final Draft can be extremely beneficial.

		Many people ask if they should number their scenes. I personally counsel them against it, but it’s only a personal preference. Some people do, some people don’t. Sometimes writers get hung up in the numbering, and that’s really not what it’s about. It’s simply a matter of choice. Just know that it’s not the writer’s job to number the scenes. Final shooting scripts have numbers running down the left margin. They indicate scene breakdowns compiled by the production manager, not the writer. When a script is bought, and the director and cast are signed, a production manager is hired. The production manager and director will go over the script, scene by scene, shot by shot. Once locations are established, the production manager and his assistant will make a production board, a large foldout folio with each scene, interior or exterior, specifically notated on cardboard strips. When the production board is complete and the scenes notated and approved by the director, the production secretary types the numbers of each scene on each page for a shot-by-shot breakdown. These numbers are used to identify each shot, so when the film (maybe 300,000 to 500,000 feet of it) is processed and catalogued, every piece of film will be identified. It is not the writer’s job to number the scenes.

		A word about the title page. Many new and aspiring screenwriters feel they should include statements, registration or copyright information, various quotes, dates, or whatever on the title page. They want to present “The Title,” an original screenplay for an “Epic Production of a Major Motion Picture for an All-Star Cast,” by John Doe, “Registered at the Writers Guild of America.”

		Don’t do it. The title page is the title page. It should be simple and direct: “The Title” should be in the middle of the page, “A Screenplay by John Doe” directly under it, and your address or phone number in the lower-right-hand corner. Several times, as head of the story department, I would receive material from new writers without any information about where I could reach them. Those scripts were held for two months, then dumped into the wastebasket.

		You don’t need to include any copyright or registration information on the title page. But it is essential for you to protect your material.

		There are three legal ways to claim ownership of your screenplay:

		1. Copyright your screenplay: To do this, obtain copyright forms from the Library of Congress. Write to:

		 			Registrar of Copyright

			Library of Congress

			Washington, D.C. 20540



		You can also obtain copyright forms from your local Federal Building. There is no charge for this service.

		2. Place a copy of your screenplay in an envelope and send it to yourself, special delivery, return receipt requested. Make sure the postmark shows clearly; this will prove the date of authorship and will be helpful in any legal situation that may arise. When you receive the envelope, file it away. DO NOT OPEN IT! This may not stand up in a court of law, but it shows, by the date and stamp, that your screenplay was written by you on such and such a date.

		3. The easiest and most effective way to register your material is with the Writers Guild of America, West or East. The Writers Guild provides a registration service that “provides evidence of the writer’s prior claim to authorship of the literary material involved and the date of its completion.” You may register by sending a clean copy of the script to the WGA, West or East, or by registering the material with them online. At this writing the cost for registration is $10 for members in good standing and $20 for nonmembers. If you want to register your script by mail at the WGA, send a clean copy of your screenplay with a check for the proper amount to the Registration Office:

		To register online, go to www.wga.org and click “register your script online.”

		If you register by mail, they will take the clean copy of your screenplay, microfilm it, and store it in a safe place for ten years, at which time you can renew the material again. Your receipt is proof that you’ve written what you say you’ve written. If someone does plagiarize your material, and you can prove “prior access,” your attorney will subpoena the Custodian of Records of the WGA, who will appear in your behalf.

		There have been times when a writer has submitted material to a producer or studio and it’s been rejected, and sometime later the writer has seen his/her idea in a movie and thinks the concept was ripped off. Sometimes this happens, and sometimes people think it happens. Several years ago, the world-famous humorist-journalist Art Buchwald, with Alain Bernheim, wrote a movie treatment for a film called Coming to America for Paramount Pictures. A deal was negotiated and they were paid. The studio ultimately passed on the idea and Buchwald continued with his journalistic chores. Later, an Eddie Murphy movie was released by Paramount that seemed to have been taken directly from the treatment that Buchwald and Bernheim had written. Buchwald filed a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures claiming the studio had taken their idea and not paid them for it.

		The lawsuit garnered a lot of headlines, and also set a major precedent. In order to prove their case, Buchwald and Bernheim had to reveal studio accounting practices, which was a monumental task, to say the least. Finally, after a long litigation, the court awarded them some $900,000 for copyright infringement. They’d been able to prove “prior access,” meaning they proved they had submitted their idea to Paramount.

		Many times you’ll hear writers worrying about whether to submit a screenplay to a studio or production company because of fears their ideas will be stolen. Well, according to copyright law, you “cannot copyright an idea, only the expression of the idea.” An idea is three guys stealing moon rocks from Houston’s NASA facility. How they do it, and who the characters are who do it, is “the expression of the idea.” That’s why if you write an unsolicited screenplay and want to submit it to a studio or production company, you will be asked to sign a release forgoing any right to litigate over any claims, either now or in the future, of copyright infringement.

		For example, many years ago a friend of mine wrote a script for a movie that was about a competitive skier on the European ski circuit. She sent it to a number of production companies. The companies all returned the material with a “thanks, but no thanks” letter.

		A couple of years later she went to see a movie about a skier on the European ski circuit, made by a company she had submitted her script to. She saw a number of similarities to her screenplay. In fact, she thought it was her story.

		So, she went to court and filed a lawsuit and ultimately was granted a settlement because she proved prior access—she had registered her script at the WGA, West, and had a copy of the rejection letter from the production company.

		Nobody did anything “intentional” in this situation. The production company had refused her idea, for whatever reason, and when later it went looking for a subject for a film, someone “had an idea” about a competitive skier.

		There have been other times when a movie is released, and writers who have written a work, usually an unproduced novel or screenplay, claim copyright infringement. They had submitted their material to the company but it was returned, unopened and unread. They had no case. They could not prove prior access, and while the ideas may have been somewhat similar, the “expressions of the idea” were not. I’ve been called as an expert witness on several of these cases, and not one was legally substantiated.

		When you’re ready to get your material into the marketplace, you’ll need about ten copies. Most story executives don’t return material. If you send it to a producer or company, you’ll need to keep a record of when you sent it and to whom. If you do send it to a company, someone must know the script is coming, either through e-mail or as hard copy. Otherwise, the material will be deleted, or returned unread, as no release form was signed. (Sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your material simply lets the producer or story editor know you’re a novice screenwriter. Don’t do it. The chances are it won’t be returned anyway.) So, make ten copies. You’ll register one, either online or as hard copy. That leaves nine. If you’re fortunate enough to get an agent to represent you, or hire an entertainment attorney, they’ll want five copies immediately. That leaves you with four.

		Make sure your screenplay is bound with paper fasteners; do not submit it loose. If you want, you can put a simple cover on it, a cover that bears some connection to the screenplay. Do not use a fancy, embossed leatherette cover. Make sure your script is on 8 ½ × 11 paper, and not 8 ½ × 14, legal size.

		You’ve got one shot with your script, so make it count. One shot means this: When I was head of the story department at Cinemobile, every submission received was logged in a card file and cross-indexed by title and author. The material was read, evaluated, and written up in synopsis form. It’s called “coverage.” The reader’s comments were carefully registered, then filed away.

		If you submit your screenplay to a studio or production company, and they read and reject it, and then you decide to rewrite it and resubmit it, chances are it won’t be read. The reader will pull up the original synopsis, read the coverage, and pass on the material. If you do make changes, change the title, or use a pseudonym. No one reads the same material twice.

		Do not send a synopsis of your script along with your material; it will not be read. No one in Hollywood will read a treatment unless you’re an established screenwriter. In Canada, Europe, South America, and perhaps the Far East, a writer can often sell his/her treatment and get money (though not much) from the government-subsidized film industry to develop the story into a screenplay—but that’s only on the international film scene. In Hollywood, if you send a synopsis with your material it will be to your disadvantage and like as not, immediately thrown out. Usually, a screenplay has to pass the gauntlet of “The Reader.” Decisions about whether or not to seriously consider a particular screenplay are usually based on this reader’s comments.

		So then how do you get it to people? Since most people in Hollywood don’t accept unsolicited material—that is, they don’t accept material unless it’s submitted through an authorized literary agent, an agent who has signed the Artists-Managers Agreement drawn up by the WGA—the question then becomes: Do I need an agent to sell my script, and if so, how do I get an agent?

		I hear that question over and over again. If you’re going to sell your script for a cool million or more and have Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts star in it, you’ll need a literary agent. So, how do you get an agent?

		First, you must have a completed screenplay. An outline, or treatment, doesn’t work. Then you can contact the Writers Guild of America, West or East, and ask them, by e-mail, mail, or phone, to send you the list of authorized signatory agents to the Artists-Managers Agreement. They’ll send you a list of agents. Those agents who are willing to read unsolicited material from new writers are indicated, usually with an asterisk.

		List several of them. Contact them by mail, e-mail, or phone; ask if they would be interested in reading a screenplay by a new writer. Give your background; sell yourself. Everybody is a buyer and seller in Hollywood.

		Most of them will say no. Try some more. They’ll say no, too. Try some more. Hollywood is a “no” town; it’s easier to say no than yes. But just think what would happen if someone were to say yes to the material.

		If the film goes through the line of executives to finally be “green-lit” for production, and the film does get made, and does well at the box office, that’s a dream come true for you. On the other hand, if it doesn’t do well, the person who brought in the material may be let go. After all, there are millions of dollars riding on his/her decision. The average life span of a film executive in Hollywood is about five years.

		Be that as it may, the irony is that executives are always looking for good material. There is a dearth of salable material in Hollywood. Most of the screenplays submitted are derivative of old movies or television series or are takeoffs or satires on films that have already been made. The opportunities for new screenwriters, writing fresh and original ideas, are enormous.

		Most of the time when you’re seeking representation, you’ll talk to the agent’s assistant or secretary. Sometimes they’ll even be the ones to read your screenplay. If they like it they’ll recommend it. Let anyone who wants to read your script read it. A good script does not go unfound. As long as it’s legally protected, there’s usually not a problem.

		Even if an agent likes your screenplay, he/she may not be able to sell it. But he will be able to show it around as a sample of your writing ability. As one agent told me, there’s nothing as hot as a script that “almost” gets sold. Sometimes that will lead to a rewriting assignment, or an opportunity to pitch another one of your script ideas. Sometimes, if a producer or story editor likes your work, you may be able to get a “development deal” from a studio or producer to write an original, or to adapt one of their ideas or books into a screenplay. Everybody’s looking for writers, no matter what “they” say.

		Give the agent three to six weeks to read your material. If you don’t receive a reply from him or her within that period of time, you can call.

		If you submit your script to a large, well-known agency, like William Morris, ICM, or CAA, the established agents will ignore it. But they have readers and trainee agents there, and they all have an incentive to read it and possibly discover a marketable script.

		If you’re fortunate, you might even find someone who likes your work and wants to represent you.

		Who is the best agent?

		The agent who likes your work and wants to represent you.

		If you contact eight agents, you’ll be lucky to find one who likes your work. You can submit your script to more than one agent at a time, but not at the same agency.

		A literary agent gets a 10 to 15 percent commission on whatever he or she sells. Good material does not get away from the readers in Hollywood; they can spot potential movie material within ten pages. If your script is good and worthy of production, it’s going to be found. How it’s found is another matter.

		It’s a survival process. Your screenplay is entering the raging current of the Hollywood river, and like salmon swimming upstream to spawn, only a few will make it.

		If finding an agent the “normal” way is not working for you, a good way to get your work read and possibly “discovered” is by submitting it in one of the many screenwriting contests that now exist throughout the world. A mention to a production company that your script has been selected as one of the finalists, or winners, in a prominent screenwriting contest like the Nichols Fellowship, Final Draft’s Big Break Contest, the Chesterfield Competition, Script-Shark’s Annual Screenwriting Competition, the Diane Thomas Award, or any of several other competitions, carries a strong appeal in the exclusive world of Hollywood. Each contest receives from three to five thousand entries each year, and at present there are over a thousand of them; just go online and Google “screenwriting contests.” Take a look at the Database of Screenwriting Contests and Competitions (www.filmmakers.com/​contests) and you’ll find a list of contests and information on financial prizes, entry dates, deadlines, etc. The legitimate contests offer awards of up to $10,000 cash, as well as meetings with top agents and executives in the industry. I’ve been one of the judges for the Final Draft competition several times now and can tell you that the quality of the work is high. Many of the winners have gone on to find agents and have their screenplays produced. That’s a good percentage of success, and a good way to break into the business.

		Another way to bring your script to the attention of production executives is called “online posting.” For a fee you can send your script to an online literary service like ScriptShark.com, a division of Baseline StudioSystems. ScriptShark is a professional script coverage and story development service specifically designed for the entertainment industry. It works this way: You submit your screenplay to ScriptShark and an industry reader will read and evaluate your material, then give you professional feedback. If the reader likes the material, he/she will post the synopsis of the story on the service’s Web site. Most development and creative executives from major production companies check the postings daily because they’re always looking for new material; thus it’s a good way to get your material seen without going through an agent or attorney. And indeed, ScriptShark has been instrumental in helping more than one writer move forward professionally. Several screenwriters have sold/optioned scripts, and ScriptShark has assisted them in setting up pitch meetings, landing writing assignments, and getting representation.

		After you complete your screenplay, you’re entering the battlefield. Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East. Do you know how many movies the studios and independent production companies made last year? Not that many: between four and five hundred. And while the number of studio productions today is increasing slightly, the number of people writing screenplays is dramatically increasing. As the number of people writing screenplays is increasing, so is the cost of making movies—it costs several thousand dollars a minute to make a major Hollywood production. That’s why even a medium-budget movie in Hollywood today costs somewhere between $60 and $80 million—and the cost of prints and advertising is mind-boggling. A Hollywood production has to gross at least two and a half times its negative cost to break into profit. So, if a film cost $60 million to produce, it has to gross more than $150 million to just to break even. Not many films gross $150 million. And if a film doesn’t open in its first or second weekend with good numbers, it will just disappear after a few weeks. But with the ancillary markets, foreign markets, the DVD market, merchandising products, and TV and cable sales, at some point in the future the film might still make some kind of profit.

		The only thing that does not change is the story. You may have the greatest special effects in the world, or the most popular actors in the world, but if there is no story that engages the hearts and minds and emotions of the audience, you don’t have much of anything. The story is the center, the hub, the dynamic force that holds everything together. Sideways is a good example. Adapted from a novel by Rex Pickett, written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, starring four largely unknown actors, it is an exceptional movie. You can make a good movie from a good script; you can make a good movie from a mediocre script; but you can’t make a good movie from a bad script. And that’s where all your energies should go—into writing the best script you can.

		What kind of a deal can you expect to make if someone wants to buy your screenplay? Prices vary, but a good rule of thumb is the Writers Guild of America minimum. The minimum is broken down into two categories: a low-budget movie that costs between $1.2 and $5 million to produce, and a high-budget film that costs more than $5 million. At this writing, the WGA minimum for a low-budget, original screenplay, including a treatment, is $48,738; for a high-budget film, $91,495. These minimums will increase each time a new MBA (Minimum Basic Agreement) is negotiated.

		Most screenwriters don’t sell their first screenplay, but there are exceptions. One of my former students at the Professional Writing Program at USC wrote her thesis script and started sending it around. An agent’s assistant read it, liked it, and gave it to her boss; he read it, liked it, and sent it to a friend of his, a production executive. The executive liked it, told the agent, and the agent promptly sent it out and sold it for about $600,000. Now, the writer didn’t get all this money up front. She got a few thousand dollars when she signed the agreement, and if and when the producer gets a production/distribution agreement, she’ll get a large chunk; then, on the first day of principal photography, she’ll get another chunk, and there may even be a “production bonus.”

		An “eyeball” price for a screenplay used to be 5 percent of the budget, though that varies substantially. If you sell the script, you’ll probably receive a “percentage of the profits,” at least on paper. You may get anywhere from 2.5 to 5 percent of the producer’s net—whatever you can get. But since hardly any films ever show a profit, at least in the accountants’ books, the chances are slim to none that you’ll ever receive any of your percentage.

		If someone wants to buy your script, he/she will probably option it for a year, with an option for a second. With an option, someone pays you for the exclusive right to get a “deal” or to raise financing for a certain period of time, usually a year or two. The option price may be anything, from $1 a year to $100,000 or more—whatever you, or your attorney, can negotiate.

		It may take you more than a year after you receive your option money to receive the full amount for the screenplay. This is the standard-type “step deal” in Hollywood. The numbers may vary, but the procedure will not.

		If you do get an offer on your script, let someone represent you, either an agent or an attorney. An attorney will either charge by the hour or receive 5 percent of your earnings from the project.

		You can obtain an option for a book or novel just like a screenplay. If you want to adapt a book or novel, you must obtain the motion picture and theatrical rights to it. To find out if the material is available, call the publisher of the hardbound edition. Ask, either by mail, e-mail, or phone, for the subsidiary rights department. Inquire if the motion picture and theatrical rights are available. If they are, they’ll tell you or refer you to the literary agent who represents the author. Contact the agent, who will tell you whether the rights are available or not.

		If you decide to adapt the material without obtaining the motion picture rights, you might find you’ve wasted your time, that the rights are not available and somebody else owns them. If you can find out who has the rights, that person or company might be willing to read your screenplay. Or might not.

		If you want to adapt the material simply as an exercise, do it. Just be sure you know what you’re doing so you’re not wasting your time.

		It costs so much to make a movie today that everyone wants to minimize the risk; that’s why money paid to a writer is termed “front money,” or “risk money.”

		No one likes to take a risk. And the motion picture business is one of the biggest crapshoots around. No one knows whether a given film is going to “go through the roof,” like Star Wars, Titanic, and Lord of the Rings, and people are reluctant to put up a lot of front money for an uncertain return. Do you know anyone who spends money easily? Including yourself? Studios, production companies, and independent producers are no exception.

		Option money comes out of producers’ pockets and they want to minimize the risks. So don’t expect a lot of money for your material the first time out: It just doesn’t work that way.

		There are always exceptions, of course, and these are the ones you always hear about—but they are the exceptions, not the rule.

		When you really get down to it, you’re writing your screenplay for yourself first, for money second.

		Only a handful of well-known and established writers in Hollywood get enormous sums of money for their screenplays. There are about 9,500 members of the Writers Guild, West, and only a few are hired to write screenplays. And less than a handful earn six figures a year. And those who do earn every penny of it.

		Don’t set up unreal expectations for yourself.

		Just write your screenplay.

		Then worry about how much money you’re going to make.

		Like the ancient scripture the Bhagavad Gita says: “Don’t be attached to the fruits of your actions.” You are writing your screenplay because it’s something you want to do, not because you want to sell it for a lot of money. It just doesn’t work that way.

		Keep your dreams and reality separate. They’re two distinct worlds.

		A Personal Note


		 			“Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.”

			—The Shawshank Redemption

			Frank Darabont





When I first started out as a writer and teacher, I asked myself what I wanted to accomplish in my teaching and books, and the answer was always the same: I wanted screenwriters to write better movies, movies that would serve and inspire audiences around the world to find their common humanity. I knew future technologies would emerge and that there would be new, more advanced ways of telling stories with pictures. But I felt that if people understood what makes a good story, what makes a good screenplay, it would be of value to filmmakers and audience alike. When I uncovered the paradigm, I didn’t really discover anything new; this concept of storytelling has been around since Aristotle’s time. I simply uncovered what was already there, gave it a name, and illustrated how it worked in contemporary movies.

		Over the last few years there’s been a significant technological evolution going on in the world of film, and understanding the role of dramatic structure in the screenplay has become the focus of intense and international debate. The discussion rages between conventional and unconventional methods of storytelling, between linear and nonlinear means of storytelling, between Chinatown and The Manchurian Candidate; The Lord of the Rings and The Bourne Supremacy; Thelma & Louise and Pulp Fiction; The Shawshank Redemption and The Hours; Y Tu Mamá También and Run Lola Run; and many, many more. Of course, each screenplay, each story, is unique and individual, but I find these debates good because they inspire conversations of discovery, new points of departure in the evolution of the screenplay. The essence of structure does not change; only the form changes, the way in which the story is put together. And if that leads to new ways of telling stories with pictures, then I’ve accomplished what I set out to do. So while “we may be through with the past,” as the Narrator says in Magnolia, “the past may not be through with us.”

		I believe the silver screen is like a mirror, reflecting our thoughts, our hopes, our dreams, our successes, our failures. Writing a screenplay and going to the movies is an ongoing journey, a lifetime adventure; for those images on the page and those dancing shadows of light on the giant screen simply reflect our lives, where the end might be the beginning, and the beginning the end.

		As I sit in a darkened theater, I’m sustained by an unbridled hope and optimism. I don’t know whether I’m looking for answers to my own questions about life, or whether I’m sitting in the dark silently giving thanks that I’m not up there on that giant screen confronting the struggles and challenges I’m seeing. But I do know that somewhere in those reflected images, I may glean an insight, an awareness, a hope that might embrace the personal meaning of my life.

		I think about this as I look back over the footprints of my journey. I see where I began my trek, gaze over the ground I’ve covered, the trails I’ve traversed, and understand it’s not the destination but the journey itself that is both the goal and the purpose.

		Just like writing a screenplay. It’s one thing to say you’re going to do it; it’s another to do it.

		Everybody’s a writer.

		That’s what you’ll find out. As you share your enthusiasm about your screenplay, everybody will have a suggestion, a comment, or a better idea about what they would have done. Then they’ll tell you about the great idea they have for a screenplay.

		Try not to make any judgments about what you’ve written. It might take years for you to “see” your script objectively. You may never. Judgments of “good” or “bad” or “right” or “wrong,” or comparisons between “this” and “that,” are meaningless within the creative experience.

		It is what it is.

		Hollywood is a “dream factory,” a town of talkers. Go to any of the various hangouts around town and you’ll hear people talking about the scripts they’re going to write, the movies they’re going to produce, the deals they’re going to make.

		It’s all talk.

		Action is character, right? What a person does, and not what he says, is who he is.

		Everybody’s a writer.

		There is a tendency in Hollywood to second-guess the writer; the studio, the star, the director, the producer will all make changes in the script that they think will “improve” it. Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don’t. Most people in Hollywood assume they’re “larger” than the original material. “They” know what has to be done to “make it better.” Directors do this all the time.

		A film director can take a great script and make a great film. Or he can take a great script and make a terrible film. But he can’t take a terrible script and make a great film.

		No way.

		Some film directors know how to improve a screenplay by visually tightening the story line. They can take a wordy dialogue scene of three to four pages and condense it into a tense and dramatic three-minute scene that “works” with five lines of dialogue, three looks, somebody taking a drink, a dog barking, and an insert of a clock on the wall. Michael Mann did this in Collateral; he sculpted the original screenplay by Stuart Beattie, visually tightening it into a tension-packed film that captures both the essence and the integrity of the script.

		That’s the exception, not the rule.

		The rule is that most directors and stars in Hollywood have little or no story sense at all. They’ll second-guess the writer, making changes in the story line that weaken and distort it, and eventually a lot of money is spent making a lousy film that nobody wants to see. And you’re only as good as your last film.

		In the long run, of course, everybody loses—the studios lose money, the director adds a “flop” to his “track record,” and the writer takes the rap for writing a bad screenplay.

		Everybody’s a writer.

		Some people will complete their screenplays. Others won’t. Writing is hard work, a day-by-day job, five or six days a week, three or more hours a day. And some days are better than others. A professional writer is someone who sets out to achieve a goal and then does it. Just like life. Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it or you don’t. And then there’s the old “natural law” of survival and evolution.

		There are no “overnight success stories” in Hollywood. Like the saying goes, “The overnight success took fifteen years to happen.”

		Believe it. It’s true.

		Professional success is measured by persistence and determination. The motto of the McDonald’s Corporation is summed up in its poster called “Press On”:

		Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.

		Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.

		Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.

		Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.

		Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.

		When you complete your screenplay, you’ve accomplished a tremendous achievement. You’ve taken an idea, expanded it into a dramatic or comedic story line, then sat down and spent several weeks or months writing it. Inception through completion. It’s a satisfying and rewarding experience. It’s been your best friend and your worst enemy. It’s kept you up nights and let you sleep like a baby. “True art is in the doing of it,” Jean Renoir said.

		Commitment and sacrifice are two sides of the same coin.

		Wear that proudly.

		Talent is God’s gift. Either you have it or you don’t. Don’t let selling or not selling your screenplay alter your internal state of mind, your feelings about yourself. Don’t let it interfere with the experience of writing. In the long run, you did what you set out to do. You fulfilled your hopes and dreams, fulfilled your goal.

		Writing brings its own rewards. Enjoy them.

		Pass it on.

Introduction


			 				 					“Qu’est-ce que le cinéma? What is film?”

				 					 						—Jean Renoir





			“What is film?” Is it art? Literature?

			That was the question my mentor Jean Renoir, the great French film director, often presented to us during the year he was Artist in Residence at the University of California, Berkeley. I met him after a performance of Woyzeck, the Georg Buchner expressionist drama, in which I was playing the lead role. I was told that Renoir was going to present the world premiere of his play Carola, and I was being asked to audition for the part.

			A few days later, I read for Renoir, got the third lead in the play, playing the role of Campan, the French stage manager, and so began my mentorship with a man who would ultimately shape my attitude toward movies and my life. For the next year, I had a direct, close, and personal relationship with the great director. Not knowing much about film, what it was or what it could be, it was Renoir who opened up a treasure chest of knowledge and insight. He shared his personal view that movies “are a new form of printing—another form of the total transformation of the world through knowledge.” He would refer to Lumière, inventor of the early French motion picture camera called the Cinématographe, as “another Gutenberg.”

			Renoir insisted that movies had the potential to be literature, but they should never be considered art. When I asked what he meant, he replied that art is the sole vision of one person, which in the scheme of the filmmaking process, is a contradiction. He explained that one person can’t do everything that’s required to make a movie. One person can write the screenplay, direct the film, photograph it, edit it, and score it—like Charlie Chaplin did—but, Renoir continued, the filmmaker cannot act all the parts, or record all the sound, or handle all the lighting requirements amid the myriad other details that are required to make a movie. “Art,” he said, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator.”

			As young college students learning from the master, we would literally sit at his feet and ask questions, share our ideas, or discuss our opinions of life and art. He would answer everything. Every question, even the dumbest one, was received with interest and respect. When someone asked, “how can we be true to our art?” he shared his personal philosophy that “art is in the doing of it.”

			A simple answer, yet profound, relevant, and true. It’s only during the process of working, he explained, whether directing a film, writing a song, writing a script, painting a picture, or whatever it may be, that one “creates art.” Art, he proclaimed, is the process of actually sitting down and doing it. Not talking about doing it, not thinking or fantasizing about doing it, just doing it. Only after the work has been completed and exposed to public view will it be considered a work of “art” or not. If you think you’re “an artist” just waiting for that one moment of inspiration to sit down and write, you’ll be waiting forever.

			Over the past twenty-five years, I’ve thought about Renoir’s words as I’ve traveled the world conducting screenwriting seminars for professional and aspiring screenwriters. As I look back over the footprints of my life from the time I wrote the first edition of this book, some twenty-five years ago, to now, I see that screenwriting, both as an art and a craft, has evolved into an international language of engaging visual expression.

			We’re currently standing on the threshold of a new frontier in film, and there are no rules as to what we can or cannot do. It is a time of evolution/revolution, a time of transformation in which the theater of technology has embraced a new era of digital technology. What we see and how we see it have changed.

			Story exposition is shown rather than told; characters are revealed through behavior, not dialogue; time present and past have merged into a compelling storytelling device. As said in Eastern philosophy, the inside and outside are one; the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are inside our head are what creates the fabric of our experience. Basically, you are the baker of the bread you eat.

			A screenplay is a special form; it is a story told in pictures, expressed in dialogue and description. The technological impact has facilitated a change in our classic traditional narrative; linear story lines like Casablanca and The Godfather, expressed in long expository scenes, have become more visually stylized presentations such as Sideways, Magnolia, and Brokeback Mountain. Nonlinear storytelling, almost a rarity during the last few decades, has now become part of a film lexicon that seems taken for granted: The Bourne Supremacy, Memento, and The Constant Gardener, are structured in bits and pieces from the shards and broken fragments of memory and have become part of the screenwriter’s language.

			The question Renoir posed so many years before, “Qu’est-ce que le cinéma?” is as relevant today as when I first heard it. How do we define the art of film? How do we analyze it? How do we craft our movies so they are more than mere flashing images on the screen, but become what Renoir referred to as “an art form that is larger than life.”

			We are now living in a time of visual storytelling. Whether you want to tell a story on the big screen or write a television show that can be downloaded onto an iPod, cell phone, or PDA; whether you want to create a video game or short film; a business plan or a Power-Point presentation for any future delivery system, you have to know the tools and rules of visual storytelling. That’s what The Screenwriter’s Workbook is all about.

			The Screenwriter’s Workbook explores the process of writing a screenplay, which is visual storytelling. I call it a “what-to book,” meaning that if you have an idea for a screenplay, but don’t exactly know what to do to write it, this book will guide you through the screenwriting process. No matter whether it’s a feature, a short film, a commercial, or other form of visual presentation, the book works. Read a chapter, do the exercise at the end of the chapter, and by the end of the book you will have written a screenplay. The screenwriting process can be applied to any form of visual storytelling.

			The Screenwriter’s Workbook is based on the screenwriting workshops I have conducted around the world. I design and structure these seven-week workshops so students spend the first four weeks preparing to write, and the second three weeks writing. The goal of the class (and I’m very big on goals) is to write and complete the First Act, (anywhere from twenty to thirty pages) of the screenplay.

			People come into a workshop with a short idea of their story. For example: “My story is about a woman executive on vacation in Hawaii, who meets and has an affair with a young man, then returns home only to learn the relationship doesn’t work.”

			That simple.

			In the first class we talk about the subject of the screenplay, the action and character—basically what happens and whom it happens to—and discuss the nature of dramatic structure. Their first assignment when they leave the class is to structure their idea, then write a four-page treatment focusing on the ending, the beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. I call this the “kick in the ass” exercise because the student is taking an unformed idea and trying to give it form; it very well may be the most difficult pages the participant writes.

			The second week we talk about character, and how to give the main character a history by writing a character biography, the character’s life from birth up until the time the story begins. They also outline the character’s professional life, personal life, and private life. Their assignment for the next week is to write character biographies of their main character and one or two other major characters. The third week we structure the story line of Act I on 3 × 5 cards, and write up a back story, that is, what happens either a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins. The fourth week we write the first ten pages and the rest of the workshop is devoted to writing approximately ten pages a week. At the end of this seven-week session, the student will have completed the First Act of their screenplay, anywhere from twenty to thirty pages.

			We take a short break and then continue into the Second Act Workshop. The goal of this seven-week course is to write and complete Act II of the screenplay. In the third seven-week workshop they complete Act III and rewrite the material.

			By the end of the three sessions, almost 80 percent of my students complete their screenplays. Many have had tremendous success: Anna Hamilton Phelan wrote Mask in class, followed soon after with Gorillas in the Mist; John Singleton worked on Boyz n the Hood, followed by Poetic Justice; Michael Kane wrote The Color of Money, João Emanuel Carneiro worked on Central Station in the workshop I conducted in Rio de Janeiro; Janus Cercone wrote Leap of Faith in class; Randi Mayem Singer did Mrs. Doubtfire; Carmen Culver, The Thorn Birds; Laura Esquivel adapted her novel Like Water for Chocolate during my course in Mexico City; and in the same class Carlos Cuarón started exploring the idea of what would later become Y Tu Mamá También. There are others as well: Todd Graff (Used People, Angie), Kevin Williamson (Scream), Todd Robinson (White Squall), Humanitas Award winner Linda Elstad (Divorce Wars), and many others.

			Several students have had their screenplays and teleplays optioned by producers and a few of my students have become production executives at film studios and production companies.

			This book is designed and structured like my screenwriting workshops. Read a chapter, do the exercise at the end of the chapter, and by the end of the book you will have written a screenplay—at least in theory. The Screenwriter’s Workbook is a step-by-step work plan for you to follow from the inception of the idea through completion; it is a map, a navigational guidance system to steer you through the screenwriting process. What’s important to know is that the material works.

			The exercises following each chapter are the tools that offer you the opportunity to expand and sharpen your understanding of the screenwriting process. I hope you view your journey through the screenwriting experience in this light. You won’t learn anything unless you give yourself permission to make some mistakes, to try things that don’t work, and do some plain old shitty writing.

			Are you willing to do that? Are you willing to try something that doesn’t work? Are you willing to write terrible pages? Are you willing to be lost in doubt and confusion, angry and concerned, not knowing whether your material is working or not?

			This book is a learning experience. It is experiential. The more you do, the better you get, just like swimming or riding a bicycle.

			Read the book, and when you’re ready to start working on your screenplay, go through the book a chapter at a time. It is a step-by-step process; you may spend a week or a month on a single chapter, it really doesn’t matter. Take as much time as you need to complete the material in each exercise.

			The purpose of The Screenwriter’s Workbook is to clarify, expand, and enlarge your knowledge, comprehension, and technique of the screenplay and the art and craft of screenwriting. The Workbook enables you to teach yourself the skills and craft required to write a professional screenplay.

			Don’t look for perfection. “Perfection,” as Jean Renoir constantly pointed out, “exists only in the mind, not in reality.”

			Just tell your story.

			The Blank Page


			 				The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write.



			A short time ago, I was having dinner with a group of friends, and as is so often the case, the subject turned to movies. We talked about films we had seen, films we liked, films we didn’t like, and what we liked or disliked about them, which covered a broad spectrum ranging from the acting performances to the editing and photography to the music, special effects, and so on. We talked about some of the great moments in films, lines of dialogue that still reside in our awareness, and while the conversation was intriguing and stimulating, what I really found so interesting was that nobody made any mention of the screenplay. It was as if the script didn’t exist. When I mentioned that fact, the only response I got was, “Oh yeah, it was a great script,” and that’s about as far as it went.

			I immediately noticed a short pause in the conversation, and then one of the other guests, an actress and television talk show host, mentioned she had written a book and several of her friends wanted her to turn it into a screenplay. She confessed she felt she needed a “partner” to help her take her novel, her own story, and write it as a screenplay.

			When I asked why, she explained she was frightened of “confronting” the blank sheet of paper. But she had already written the novel, I replied, so how could she be frightened about turning it into a screenplay? Was it the form that challenged her? Or the visual description of images, the sparseness of dialogue, or the structure that frightened her? We discussed it for a while and as she was trying to explain her feelings, I realized many people have that same fear. Even though she was a published author, she was afraid of dealing with the blank page. She didn’t know exactly what to do or how to go about doing it.

			This is not such an unusual scenario. Many people have great ideas for a screenplay but when they actually sit down to write it they are seized by fear and insecurity because they don’t know how to go about actually doing it.

			Screenwriting is such a specific craft that unless you know where you’re going, it’s very easy to get lost within the maze of the blank page. The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. If you don’t know what your story is about, who does? Throughout my many years of teaching screenwriting, both here and abroad, people approach me all the time and tell me they want to write a screenplay. They say they have a great idea, or a brilliant opening scene, or a fantastic ending, but when I ask them what their story is about, their eyes glaze over, they stare off into the distance and tell me it’ll all come out in the story. Just like Miles when he tries to describe what his novel is about to Maya in Sideways. Great.

			When you sit down and tell yourself that you’re going to write a screenplay, where do you begin? With the dream of a heroic action like the Max Fischer character (Jason Schwartzman) in Rushmore (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson)? With still photographs that show us the era in which your story takes place, like the Great Depression in Seabiscuit (Gary Ross)? In a darkened bedroom, with a clock ticking loudly and two people moaning in sexual passion, like Shampoo (Robert Towne and Warren Beatty)?

			If you tell yourself you want to write a screenplay and then vow to commit weeks, months, or even years writing it, how do you confront the blank page? Where does the writer begin? It’s a question I hear at workshops and seminars all the time.

			Does the writer begin with a person, location, title, situation, or theme? Should he/she write a treatment, outline it, or write the book first and then the screenplay? Questions, questions, questions. All those questions really reflect the question: How do you take an unformed idea, a vague notion, or a gut feeling and transfer that into the roughly one hundred and twenty pages of words and pictures that make up a screenplay?

			Writing a screenplay is a process—an organic, ever-changing, evolving stage of growth and development. Screenwriting is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. Like all literary arts, whether fiction or nonfiction, plays or short stories, there are definite stages a writer works through while fleshing out an idea. The creative process is the same no matter what you’re writing.

			When you sit down to write a screenplay and confront the blank page, you have to know what story you’re writing. You only have a hundred and twenty pages to tell your story, and when you begin writing it’s apparent very quickly that you don’t have much room to work with. A screenplay is more like a poem than a novel or play in which you can feel your way through the story.

			James Joyce, the great Irish writer, once wrote that the writing experience is like climbing a mountain. When you’re scaling a mountain, all you can see is the rock directly in front of you and the rock directly behind you. You can’t see where you’re going or where you’ve come from. The same principle holds true when you’re writing a screenplay; when you’re writing all you can see is what’s in front of you, that is, the page you’re writing and the pages you’ve written. You can’t see anything beyond that.

			What do you want to write about? You know you have a great idea that will make an awesome movie, so where do you begin? Are you writing a challenging character study? Are you writing about a personal experience that impacted your life? Maybe you read a great magazine or newspaper article that you know will make a great movie.

			One of my students in a recent screenwriting workshop was a published novelist and former editor of a major book publisher. She had never written a screenplay before and shared with me that she was somewhat nervous and insecure about writing the script.

			When I asked why, she replied that she didn’t know if her story was visual enough. She wanted to write a script about an active middle-aged woman who suffers a life-changing traumatic injury, and had doubts about the main character’s confinement to a hospital bed during most of the second act. This raised another concern: would the main character be too passive? Could the interest in the character’s plight be sustained with this limited sense of visual action? These were all valid, major considerations, requiring significant creative decisions.

			During her preparation period we had several discussions, talked about the possibilities of opening it up, using the visual components found in the hospital: tests like EEGs, CAT scans, PET scans, and X-rays, and having the action broken up by the arrival of emergency cases and the various activities of the nurses on the floor. I wondered what would happen in the character’s life while she was in the hospital. I suggested that she could show bits and pieces of the woman’s former life, possibly through dreams and memories, and weave those flashbacks throughout. Because the main character was so static during the Second Act, she could add several more visuals to the story line about what the woman was thinking and feeling.

			Feeling more secure, my student began preparing her material. She did her research, structured the First Act on cards, wrote up the back story, designed the opening sequences. As a novelist, she had always researched her ideas thoroughly and gradually, and it would be through the actual writing experience that she would find her story and characters. She told me she did not want to know “too much” because, in her experience, she wanted to let the story guide her to where it wants to go. I replied that you can do this when you’re writing a novel or play, but not when you’re writing a screenplay. A screenplay is a specific form; approximately one hundred twenty pages in length and knowing the end is always the first step in writing. You can “feel” your way through a four-hundred-fifty-page novel, or a one-hundred-page play, but not a screenplay.

			A screenplay follows a definite, lean, tight, narrative line of action, with a definite beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. A screenplay always moves forward toward the resolution, even if it is told in flashback like The Bourne Supremacy (Tony Gilroy), or American Beauty (Alan Ball.) A screenplay follows a singular line of action so every scene, every fragment of visual information, must be taking you somewhere, moving the narrative forward in terms of story development.

			This was somewhat difficult for my student to understand because it was unlike her previous writing experience. But after she had done her preparation, when she knew her structure and had done some background character work, she was ready to start writing. She began writing the first act, the emphasis on the professional life of her main character, an active and dynamic woman responding to the challenges of the workplace with energy and integrity. As a professional woman, it was clear her character was active, likable, and well drawn.

			But when the main character entered the hospital after the traumatic injury at the end of Act I, the tone of the story changed. The character was now confined to a hospital bed, weaving in and out of consciousness for several pages. Feeling the story becoming boring, my student became insecure and started looking for new cinematic areas to explore rather than focusing on the main character. One day she called to tell me she was writing new scenes with doctors and nurses, then told me she had a sudden inspiration to bring in the main character’s daughter, an executive who always seemed to have trouble dealing with authoritarian male figures like doctors. I told her to go ahead and try it; after all, if it works, it works, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. All she would really lose was about three days of writing.

			So she began writing this new character, the daughter, in Act II, and then another problem began to surface: the daughter was emerging as the dominant character. The mother, the main character, now seemed to be lost somewhere in a hospital room. By making the daughter the active force, or voice, in the story, my student had shifted the focus of the story line. The story was now about a daughter taking charge of the health and well-being of her mother.

			That raised another issue. The story now hinged on the idea of “a durable power of attorney for a health issue,” an interesting premise in medical therapy. The daughter was asked to choose the medical treatment for her incapacitated mother. The doctors told her there were two choices: electric shock treatments to jolt her mother out of her acute depression, or a regime of antidepressant drug therapy. And the doctors explained that both treatments could give rise to disastrous side effects. What should the daughter do? She was ambivalent about male authority figures, yet was now in a position where she had to make a life-altering decision about her mother. Seeking counsel and confronting her own feelings, the daughter decided to do nothing; she wanted to wait and see and possibly allow her mother to come out of it on her own. There were no shock treatments, no drugs, nothing; just patience, time, and understanding. At the end, the mother, through her own will, and the daughter’s help, gradually steps back on the path to health and recovery.

			That’s the way my student completed the first words-on-paper draft. When I read this first draft, I saw immediately there were two separate stories. One story was the saga of the mother who recovers from her injury to take back control of her own life. The second story dealt with the woman’s daughter who was forced, almost against her will, to take charge of the situation. And it’s during this challenge that she overcomes her own deep-seated fear of male authority and resolves the formerly strained emotional relationship with her mother.

			My student started out writing one story and ended up writing another. This happens quite often but the question remained: Was it the story of the mother or the daughter? Or both? Whose story do you tell?

			My student didn’t know. One of the things I’ve learned through the years is that when I’m uncertain about what course of action to take, I step back for a while. When in doubt, do nothing is my rule. So I suggested that she put the screenplay aside somewhere for a couple of weeks until she had a new perspective on the material. It’s important to note that the issue here was not about the quality of writing, or dialogue, or character depth, or whether it worked or not; the issue was what story the writer wanted to tell. By moving into the daughter’s domain, she changed her dramatic intention and changed the subject. I explained that it’s not a question of good or bad, or right or wrong, but whether it was the story she wanted to tell.

			She waited a short time, and then, in some doubt and uncertainty, she gave this first words-on-paper draft to a close friend of hers, a literary agent in Hollywood. Her friend saw that the script needed work, but liked the premise well enough to give it to one of her associates at the office. He read it and felt the script was “slow, dull, and boring.” It should have more action: “It’s the mother’s story,” he said. “Let’s see her getting an electric shock treatment; maybe change the opening and have it start at the accident because that would make it more active.”

			My student came to me, angry and confused. She didn’t know what to do. She kept talking about needing a more active, cinematic opening and I kept telling her that wasn’t the problem; she had to know, creatively, which story she was writing. When she first sat down to face the blank page she wanted to tell the mother’s story. She ended up telling the story of the daughter overcoming the constraints of her relationship with her mother focusing on the issue of “the durable power of attorney.”

			She kept asking me what to do, and I kept telling her she had to make a creative decision about which story she was writing. I suggested that before she began to rewrite anything, she rethink her idea from the beginning in order to find the focus and direction of her story. Who and what was her story about?

			It’s important to know that there is no “right” or “wrong” in this situation, no judgments about good or bad. The only issue is whether it works or not. So, I met her one day at a nearby Coffee Bean and while we sipped our white chocolate dream lattes, I suggested that she fashion her story into the relationship between the mother and the daughter and set it against the dramatic backdrop of her mother’s injury, showing how this brings them together with a stronger bond of love and understanding.

			She shook her head and told me this was not the story she’d planned to write. The story was about the mother. That’s fine, I said. But if she set out to write the story she wanted to write, she had to focus on that story and integrate it into the relationship with her daughter. Ultimately, she left the Coffee Bean the same way she came in; lost, confused, and uncertain. She picked away at the script for several months, didn’t feel she was making any progress with it, and finally shelved the project.

			It happens all the time; to you, to me, to anyone.

			What’s the point of the story? Creative problems are part of the landscape of screenwriting. Either it’s an opportunity to expand the limits of your craft or a way to give in to the fact that “it’s just not working.” My student couldn’t let go of her original concept and while she had a very good story, valid and meaningful, she really didn’t know which story she wanted to tell. Her mind told her one thing, her creative Self told her another.

			What could she have done to solve the problem? Look at The Sea Inside (Alejandro Amenábar), a story that covers some of the same fertile, emotional, and thought-provoking ground. While the main character, Ramón (Javier Bardem) is confined to a hospital bed and room for some 30 years, fighting for his right to die, Amenábar opens up the smothering hospital room with soaring fantasies of Ramón walking and running, dreaming of love, so the story becomes a visual and eloquent testament of our imagination and how it can touch, move, and inspire others. It is possible that my student could have visually opened up her story in order to achieve her artistic intention, but didn’t.

			Most people would say Million Dollar Baby (Paul Haggis), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, is a story about a woman determined to become a professional boxer who realizes her dream, only to become critically injured during a title fight. Other people would say this is a story framed by the female boxer but is really the story about an individual’s right to die and the moral and legal issues of euthanasia.

			In the case of Million Dollar Baby, both are true. But in my mind, the “true” story, the real subject of the screenplay, is the relationship between Frankie (Clint Eastwood) and Maggie (Hilary Swank). All the elements that make up this relationship—Maggie’s determination, Frankie training Maggie, Frankie and Scrap (Morgan Freeman) bickering—lead to the ultimate moral premise of the screenplay: Can Frankie, a tough, yet religious man, deliberately help another human being to die? Would that be labeled a criminal offense, or euthanasia? Is there a moral issue here? There are some who would call Frankie’s act of injecting Maggie a murder and others an act of mercy. Call it what you will, it still is a story about the relationship between Frankie and Maggie.

			Every screenplay is about something or someone and this subject becomes encased in the story you are telling. Can you define what you’re writing about? Who are you writing about? There are approximately one hundred twenty sheets of blank paper to fill in a screenplay. As we all know, the blank page is intimidating, a tremendous and formidable challenge. When you first set out on this writing adventure, you’ll probably only have a vague idea or an unformed notion about a character or incident running around in your head. You’ll discover when you begin to formulate the idea into a workable description it may take several pages of free-association and terrible writing just to reduce your story into a general line of character and action. It may take several days of thinking and scribbling before you can even isolate the main components of your story. Don’t worry about how long it takes. Just do it.

			Before you can put one word on paper, you have to know what and who your story is about. What is the subject of your screenplay? For example: Your story may be about an attorney who meets and falls in love with a married woman, then kills her husband so they can be together. But he’s been set up and ends up in prison, while the woman ends up with a fortune in a tropical paradise. That’s the subject of Larry Kasdan’s Body Heat. It could also be the subject of Double Indemnity, Billy Wilder’s classic film noir. A Beautiful Mind (Akiva Goldsman) is the story of a physicist who loses touch with reality, overcomes his illness, and receives a Nobel prize for his scientific achievement. Action and character. The screenplay succeeds because there is a definite line of action.

			The subject becomes a guideline for you to follow as you structure the action and the characters into a cohesive, dramatic story line. As a rule, you’ll find that either the character drives the action or the action drives the character.

			What’s it about? is the most challenging question you’ll ever be asked. In my experience, most aspiring writers seem to love the idea of writing a screenplay, but after talking with them I can tell they’re unwilling to commit the time and effort to face the challenges they’ll confront. Writing is hard work; make no mistake about it.

			When I first began writing, I would confront the blank page with fear and insecurity. And when my mind clicked in and I knew that I had to fill up some one hundred twenty sheets of blank paper for a screenplay, I totally freaked. I couldn’t deal with it. Only by dealing with, and confronting my fear, did I learn that for me, writing is a day-by-day job, five or six days a week, three or more hours a day, three or more pages a day. And some days are better than others. If I lose sight of writing the scene that is right in front of me and instead start thinking of what I should do later, it’s a total washout.

			The blank page. It’s intimidating.

			If you know your subject then you can create a step-by-step approach that will guide you through the process of writing a screenplay. If we take a look at what a screenplay is, its essential nature, then we can define it as a story told with pictures in dialogue and description and placed within the context of dramatic structure.

			So, where does the writer begin? The answer is anywhere you want to. There are many ways to approach writing a screenplay. Sometimes you begin with character—a strong, three-dimensional character in an extraordinary situation that moves your story forward with skill and clarity. Character is a good, solid starting point.

			You can also start with an idea; but an idea is only an idea unless it’s executed properly. You’ve got to take that idea and expand it, clothe it, make it say what you want it to say. “I want to write a story about a man who has a near-death experience” is not enough. You’ve got to dramatize it. Legally, the law says: “You can’t copyright an idea, only the expression of the idea.” The “expression” means the specific characters, locations, structure, and action that make up the narrative throughline of the story.

			Sometimes you may want to write a screenplay that deals with an incident, episode, or experience that happened to you or to someone you know. You can use this particular experience as the starting point in your story, but as you go through the preparation process, you’ll find that you want to hold on to the “reality” of the experience; you want to be “true” to the situation or incident. Most people find it hard to let go of the experience. But often, you’ve got to let the “reality” go in order to dramatize it more effectively. I liken it to climbing a staircase: The first step is the actual experience, the second step is increasing the dramatic potential of the story, and the third step is integrating both of the previous steps to create a “dramatic reality.” If you remain too true to “who did what” in the “real” order of the experience, it usually ends up as a thin story line with little or no dramatic impact. Do not feel “obligated” to remain “true” to reality. It doesn’t work. The “reality” of the event may, and often does, get in the way of the dramatic needs of your story.

			I tell my students over and over again to “let go” of the original source material and simply write what is needed for their story. I call it creating a dramatic reality and liken it to climbing the bottom three rungs of a staircase. The first rung is the reality, the way something really happened. But to turn it into effective drama, you might have to add some incidents or events that did not happen; I call it creating an “unreality.” That brings you to the third rung, which I call the dramatic reality. This is where you take the first rung, the reality, add the unreality incidents or elements, and make it a dramatic reality.

			It’s like writing a historical screenplay. You always have to be true to the historical incidents of the time and place. Those are historical facts which you cannot change. The actual history of the event has to be maintained but you don’t have to be true to the emotional, day-to-day events, leading up to the historical incident. Just look at All the President’s Men (William Goldman), Ray (James L. White), Erin Brockovich (Susannah Grant), and JFK (Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar). History is only the starting point, not the end point.

			A student of mine was writing a screenplay based on a true story, and taken from the diary of a Hawaiian woman in the early 1800s whose husband contracted leprosy. When his disease was found out, the couple became outcasts, hunted down by a posse determined to eradicate them.

			When my student started writing, she used exact scenes and dialogue from the diary, faithfully recording some of the authentic customs and traditions of the islanders. But it didn’t work. It was dull and had no structure, therefore it was lacking in story line and direction.

			She became frustrated. She didn’t know what to do and what direction to take in the story. So, I suggested she make up some scenes that never happened but that would help the story flow. I call it creative research. She went back to the drawing board, and a week or so later she came back with several ideas for scenes. We selected a few, wove them into the story line in this second-page unit of action, and she went back to writing. Her new scenes may never have happened, but they did capture the integrity of the source material and the story blossomed.

			The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write.

			If need be, let go of the reality of the person, incident, or event and fashion a creative reality based on the actual historical happening. Find the unreality, the theatricality of the event. This is a movie, remember. You must communicate the people, the story, and the events dramatically. Make up your scenes based on the needs of the story while honoring the integrity of the experience.

			There have been times when I’ve started with a location and used it to weave a story line. But even if you start with a particular place, it’s still not enough. You’ve got to create a character and action to build your story around.

			Many people tell me they want to start with a title. That’s cool, but what then? You need to create a plot, but a plot about what? Plot is what happens, and since you’re sitting down in front of a blank sheet of paper, it should be the furthest thing from your mind. At this point, you don’t know anything about the plot; forget plot. We’ll deal with it when the time comes. First things first. What are you going to research? You’ve got to have a subject.

			In my screenwriting workshops I always ask people, “What’s your story about?” Invariably, I hear answers like, “I’m writing a love story about two cousins.” Or “I’m writing about an Irish family in Boston at the turn of the century.” Or “I’m writing about a group of parents who build their own school when their neighborhood school is closed.”

			When I hear ideas or vague notions like this, I ask the writer to dig deeper and find a personal expression of the story he or she wants to write. And it’s not easy. Most of the time I have to badger him or her to be more specific, but after a while he or she begins to focus on who the story is about and what the story is about. That’s the starting point: the subject, where the writer begins.

			Thelma & Louise emerged as Callie Khouri was driving on the freeway and the idea suddenly popped into her mind: Two women go on a crime spree. That was the original impulse of the script. So Callie sat down and had to ask and answer some essential questions: Who are the two women? What crime did they commit? What made them commit the crime? What happens to them at the end? The answers to these questions led her to the subject, which resulted in the story line for Thelma & Louise. It’s an extraordinary movie and I use it as a teaching film all over the world. And it all came out of the idea “two women go on a crime spree.”

			Your subject can be as simple as two old friends taking a wine-tasting trip through Santa Barbara wine fields the week before one of them gets married. That’s the subject of Sideways. Once we know the subject, we have enough material to start asking some questions: Who are these two old friends? How long have they known each other? What do they do for a living? What happens to them on their trip that expands or affects their lives? What happens to them at the end of the story? Are they changed, either emotionally, physically, mentally, or spiritually by their journey? What are the emotional or psychological forces working on them when the story begins? Why do they go on a wine-tasting trip in the first place? In this case, their journey gives them the opportunity to explore their lives, their friendship, their dreams, and possibly their loneliness too.

			This is the power of the subject. It allows you to create a starting point to begin the creative process of clearly identifying and defining your story line. If you can’t articulate your subject, who can?

			Writing a screenplay is a step-by-step process, and it’s important to prepare one step at a time. First, you generate the idea, then break down the idea into the subject, a character and action. Once you have the subject, you know enough to structure it by determining the ending, the beginning, and Plot Points I and II. Once that’s done, you can build and expand your characters by writing character biographies, along with any other research you may need to do. Then you can structure the scenes and sequences, the content, of Act I on fourteen 3 × 5 cards. Next write up the back story, what happens a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins. Only after you’ve completed this preparation work can you begin writing the screenplay.

			When you’ve completed this first words-on-paper draft, you’ll do basic revisions to this second stage of this first draft, and any rewriting that’s necessary to polish and hone your material until it’s ready to be shown. Screenwriting is a process, a living thing that changes from day to day. As a result, what you write today may be out of date tomorrow. And what you write tomorrow may be out of date the next day or the day after that. You have to be clear every step of the way and know where you’re going and what you’re doing.

			When you’re writing an action movie or war film, you have to be very clear about your subject because there are so many different perspectives to explore. Saving Private Ryan (Robert Rodat), Schindler’s List (Steven Zaillian), Paths of Glory (Stanley Kubrick), and Apocalypse Now (John Milius and Francis Ford Coppola) express interesting points of view on the cost of war. So does Three Kings, David O. Russell’s extraordinary film about the Gulf War, a script that explores the nature of war by focusing more on the humanitarian aspect of what happens to both victors and losers alike. It’s a story about the price of war and the physical loss of life and limb, as well as the emotional cost of shattered psyches, and the cultural uprooting of an entire way of life.

			The action takes place the day after the war ends. Three soldiers (played by Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze) find a map on a captured Iraqi soldier. Their superior officer (George Clooney) joins them and they discover the map leads to a bunker filled with millions of dollars of Kuwaiti gold. And so, with the war over, the story line begins as the men embark on a treasure-finding mission. But what they find are Iraqi people in desperate need of assistance. This is the starting point of a film that explores the physical and emotional landscape of the effect of war upon the human spirit as well as the human body.

			‘Breaker’ Morant (Jonathan Hardy, Bruce Beresford), an Australian film made in 1980, based on the play by Kenneth Ross, is the story of an Australian military lieutenant in the Boer War (1899–1902) who is court-martialed and executed for fighting the enemy in an “unorthodox and uncivilized” fashion, meaning using guerrilla tactics, or as it’s now called, insurgent warfare. The subject questions what a soldier can and can’t do in a combat situation. At that time, there was a certain “convention” of war, and it was determined by a military tribunal that ‘Breaker’ Morant’s actions had broken the so-called code of organized warfare, which is a joke to begin with. The lieutenant is tried, convicted, and executed for political reasons, a pawn on the chessboard of international politics. His fighting tactics, issued under direct orders (later denied by his superiors, of course), had nothing to do with what he did or how he did it. The English army had to make clear to the world that they did not permit this sort of unorthodox or “uncivilized” fighting and this had to be dramatized on the world stage. They needed a political scapegoat, and ‘Breaker’ Morant was chosen to be the fall guy. Just look at the prison scandals in the Iraqi War; it’s basically the same story told in a different time and a different place.

			No matter what story you are telling, there is only one place where the writer begins—with the blank page.

			If you set out on the arduous journey of writing a screenplay, no matter what genre—whether action movie, war movie, love story, romance, thriller, mystery, western, romantic comedy, or other—and you’re unclear or unsure about what story you’re telling, it’s going to be reflected in the script. But once you frame the idea into a subject, you can take that action and character and structure it into a dramatic story line. And, that’s the starting point.

			Then you can structure it.


				THE EXERCISE

				Take your idea and begin to isolate the elements of the action and character of your proposed story line. Just throw down any thoughts or ideas on paper. You may need to free-associate the idea over several pages in order to see what you’re really writing about. Don’t be afraid to write three or more pages in order to gain more clarity on the story you want to tell. Then use your free-association essay to isolate the elements of action—what happens and the character to whom it happens.

				Once you’ve done that, reduce it into three separate paragraphs, beginning, middle, and end. Start honing each paragraph by summarizing the beginning into a few sentences; specify the character and what happens to him or her during the course of the screenplay.

				Reduce each paragraph to a sentence or two according to what happens in the action and then how it affects the character. If you want, start looking at the loglines of TV Guide to get an idea of what a subject looks like. That’s what you’re aiming for. Isolating your main character should present no problems, but defining the line of action may be a little more difficult. What’s the resolution? Can you incorporate that into the subject line? Be general in your descriptions at this point and not specific in terms of action.

				Remember, it may take you three or four pages of horrible writing to figure out what story you’re telling. Just work in fragments, or notes. There’s no need to try for complete sentences here. Trust the process. If you’ve written several pages, wandering here and there, go through the material and highlight things that help define the action or character. Take your time with this; you’re taking a vague, general idea, and reducing it to a few sentences. Sometimes, it helps to give your character a name so you can become more specific. Read it out loud. Polish it some more. Do it until you are perfectly clear about your subject and can express it clearly and concisely in three or four sentences.

				This is the first step in the screenwriting process.

			About Structure


			 				“Screenwriting is like building furniture. It’s a craft in which the pieces must fit, and it must function….The forms in screenwriting are far more limited and pre-prescribed. People talk about the three-act structure, that this is how you write a movie and it’s got these elements. And, mastering the elements and making them seem natural and invisible is the trick to writing screenplays. You have to learn it and you have to unlearn it. Or, you have to learn it and disguise it so the audience never sees the machinery of the screenwriting itself.”

				 					 						—Jose Rivera

						The Motorcycle Diaries





			When I first started teaching about structure in the screenplay, many people thought I was talking about finding the “correct formula” for writing screenplays. You know, writing “by the numbers”—you write so many pages for this, so many pages for that, you hit this plot point on page 25, that plot point on page 80, and if you do it all, according to the numbers specified, you’ll end up with a finished screenplay. I wish it were that easy. I used to get calls from students in the middle of the night whining that their Plot Point I was on page 35, and whimpering “what do I do now?” Wherever I went, people seemed to be discussing, arguing, or fighting about the importance of structure in the screenplay. People went on record either endorsing or dismissing this notion of screenwriting.

			In one of my early screenwriting workshops in Paris where I was presenting structure as the foundation of screenwriting, I was literally booed off the stage. They referred to me as le Diable (the Devil) and claimed no one could write a screenplay using structure as the organizing principle of story. When I confronted them about how they built their own story lines, they replied in vague generalities and hazy abstractions, talking about the “mystery of structure,” or the “ambiguity of the creative process,” as if trying to describe the sun on an overcast day.

			I’ve been teaching the craft of screenwriting for more than twenty-five years, and the more I talk about it, the more I understand how important structure is and how much more there is to learn.

			When I first started out, I traveled to people’s homes carrying a small white board under my arm. At that time, I can truly say I didn’t understand the significance of building a visual story line, or constructing shots, scenes, and sequences, or formulating a character’s arc and finding ways of documenting the emotional and physical changes in the character as he or she journeys through the landscape of narrative action.

			Exploring the nature of structure has been a profound and insightful journey for me. I’ve always known that a thorough knowledge and understanding of structure was essential in the writing of a screenplay—I just didn’t know how important it was. I still find screenwriters all over the world, both professional and amateur, who don’t understand the intrinsic nature of structure and its relationship to the screenplay.

			So what is structure?

			According to Webster’s New World Dictionary, there are two definitions of the word “structure.” The root struct, means, “to put together,” and the first definition is “to build something, like a building or a dam; or to put together.” When we talk about structuring a screenplay, we’re talking about building and putting together all the necessary ingredients that go into the making of a screenplay: the scenes, sequences, characters, action, and so forth. We are building, or constructing, the “content,” or events, which lead us through the story line.

			The second definition defines structure as the “relationship between the parts and the whole.” A good illustration is a chess game. If you want to play a game of chess you need four things: first, you need a chessboard; it could be as big or as small as you want, as large as a football field or as small as a matchbox. Next, you need the pieces: the king, queen, pawns, bishops, knights, and rooks. The third thing you need are players, and fourth, you need to know the rules. Without the rules, it’s not a chess game. Those four elements, the parts, make up the whole of the chess game. If you take away any one of these parts, there is no chess game. This is the relationship between the parts and the whole.

			Not too long ago it was popular to say that the whole is nothing more than the sum of its parts. That’s no longer true. Modern physics challenges that assumption with the General Systems Theory; a theory that states the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There’s an ancient Indian tale about three blind men and an elephant that illustrates this well. Three blind men are asked to describe an elephant. One man feels the trunk and says that an elephant is round, narrow, and flexible, like a snake. The second blind man feels the midsection and says the elephant is like a wall. The third feels the tail and says no, the elephant is like a piece of rope.

			Who is right? The elephant is greater than the sum of its parts. That’s the General Systems Theory.

			What does this have to do with screenwriting? Everything. “A screenplay is structure,” says the noted screenwriter William Goldman. “It is the spine you hang your story on.” When you sit down to write a screenplay, you must approach your story as a whole. As mentioned, a story is composed of parts—characters, plot, action, dialogue, scenes, sequences, incidents, events—and you, as writer, must organize these parts into a whole, with a definite shape and form, complete with beginning, middle, and end.

			Because a screenplay is such a unique form, you have to approach it from a different perspective. What is a screenplay? We define a screenplay as a story told in pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.

			It’s different than a novel or play.

			If you look at a novel and try to define its fundamental nature, you’ll see that the dramatic action, the story line, often takes place inside the head of the main character. We see the story line unfold through the eyes of that character, through his or her point of view. We are privy to the character’s thoughts, feelings, emotions, words, actions, memories, dreams, hopes, ambitions, opinions, and more. The character and reader experience the action together, sharing in the drama and emotion of the story. We know how they act or react, how they feel, and how they figure things out. If other characters are brought into the narrative, the story line may embrace their points of view, but the main thrust always returns to the main character, the one who the story is about. In a novel the action takes place inside the character’s head, within the mindscape of dramatic action. Open any novel at random and read a chapter or two and you’ll see what I mean.

			In a play the action, or story line, occurs on stage, under the proscenium arch, so the audience becomes the fourth wall, eavesdropping on the lives of the characters, what they think and feel and say. They talk about their hopes and dreams, past and future plans, discuss their needs and desires, fears and conflicts. In this case, the action of the play occurs within the language of dramatic action; it is spoken in words that describe feelings, actions, and emotions. A play is told mostly in words. The characters are talking heads.

			A screenplay is different because movies are different. Film is a visual medium that dramatizes a basic story line. It deals in pictures, images, bits and pieces of film: we see a clock ticking, ride inside a moving car, see and hear rain splattering against a windshield. We see a woman moving along a crowded street; a car slowly turning a corner, stopping in front of a large building; a man crossing the street; a woman entering an open doorway; an elevator door closing. These bits and pieces, these fragments of visual information joined together, allow us to grasp an incident or situation merely by looking at it. Just watch the opening of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh), or Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Steven Spielberg), or Andy Dufresne’s escape from prison in The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont). The essential nature of the screenplay deals in pictures.

			That is its nature.

			Jean-Luc Godard, the eminent French director, says that film is evolving into a visual language and it’s up to us to learn how to read the pictures.

			Several years ago, after I had conducted a European screenwriting workshop in Brussels, I went to visit Venice for the first time. While there, I visited the Accademia Museum, which displays a magnificent collection of early Venetian painting. In the Middle Ages, when monks in the monasteries were transcribing the Scriptures, they enlarged and elaborated the initial letter of a paragraph. (A similar convention is still followed today in which the first letter of a chapter is set in large type.) It wasn’t long before the monks were illustrating their manuscripts with scenes from the Bible, and soon they were decorating their walls with illustrations similar to Roman frescoes; then these scenes were put on wood panels which leaned against the wall, and this gave way to painting on canvas which then hung on the wall. The Accademia Museum displays a marvelous collection of this early Italian painting.

			As I wandered around the museum, I was struck by one painting in particular: it was composed of twelve individual wood panels depicting scenes in the life of Christ: one panel showed his birth, another the Sermon on the Mount, another the Last Supper, and then the Crucifixion, and so on. Something about this painting grabbed me and held my interest, and I didn’t know why. I stared at that painting for a long time, thinking about it, then moved away, and found myself coming back to it, intrigued. What made this painting different from all the others? The answer came immediately: it wasn’t just one painting. It was a series of twelve paintings mounted together to tell the story of the life and death of Christ. It was a story told in pictures.

			It was a profound experience. The interaction between the story and picture in each panel was the same as the visual relationship between the story and character in a screenplay.

			I stared at those panels, suddenly seeing the connection between painting and film. It was a stunning, awesome moment. Everything exists in relationship to something else and I remembered one afternoon when I was taking a walk with Jean Renoir after a rehearsal of his play Carola. It had just rained and as we strolled through the sloping landscape of the Berkeley Hills, he stopped and looked at a wildflower growing in the middle of a rock. “Nothing is as strong as nature,” he observed. “The force of nature is what drives that little wildflower right through the rock.” Then, as we continued walking he said, “learning is being able to see the relationship, the connections, between things.”

			I understood what he meant. The force of nature, like the force of creative expression, is like the tiny seed of the wildflower driving its way up through the rock. “The force that through the green fuse drives the flower” is the way the great poet Dylan Thomas expresses it.

			When you write a screenplay, you are describing what happens, which is why screenplays are written in the present tense. The reader sees what the camera sees, a description of the action placed within the context of dramatic structure. When you write a scene or sequence, you are describing what your characters say and do—the incidents and events that tell your story.

			Structure is a context; it “holds” the bits and pieces and fragments of images that tell your story in place. Context is really a space that holds things inside. A suitcase is a context—no matter what shape or form or fabric or size, the space inside holds clothes, shoes, toiletries, or anything else you may want to pack. A suitcase can be any size, fabric, or shape. But the space inside doesn’t change; it’s the same no matter how big or small the space is. Space is space. The same thing with an empty glass; an empty glass has space inside that holds the content in place. You can put anything you want inside that empty glass and the space, the context, does not change. You can put in coffee, tea, milk, juice, water, or whatever and the space does not change. You could also put in grapes, trail mix, nuts, anything that fits and the space, the context, always holds the content in place. In the same way, structure holds your story in place whether told in a linear or nonlinear way. It is the skeleton, the spine of your story.

			Dramatic structure is defined as “a linear arrangement of related incidents, episodes, and events leading to a dramatic resolution.”

			It is a starting point in the process of writing.

			Structure is a context; it is like the natural force of gravity; it holds everything in place. Not only does gravity influence every single element in the cosmos, from subatomic particles to the dark forces of antimatter, it affects the very life functions of every living species on Earth. Without the natural force of gravity, human beings would not be able to stand upright; nor would the trees and plants climb toward the sun; nor would the earth remain in stable orbit around our sun; nor would the sun remain in secure orbit in the Milky Way. In short, structure in the screenplay is like gravity because it holds everything together, everything in place.

			Screenplay structure is so integral to your story, so closely intertwined with the action and characters, that most of the time we don’t even see it. Most of the time, good structure remains the spine, the foundation, the invisible glue, of your screenplay. It “holds” the story in place, just the way anchor screws hold a painting on the wall. Every good screenplay has a strong and solid structural foundation whether it’s a linear film like Sideways (Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor), The New World (Terrence Malick), and The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), or a nonlinear film like The Hours (David Hare), The Bourne Supremacy (Tony Gilroy), The English Patient (Anthony Minghella), or The Usual Suspects (Christopher McQuarrie).

			What is so interesting about structure is that it’s as simple as it is complex. I liken it to the relationship between an ice cube and water. An ice cube has a definite crystalline structure, and water, a definite molecular structure. But when an ice cube melts in water, you can’t tell the difference between which molecules were the ice cubes and which molecules were the water. They are indistinguishable from each other. When we talk about structure, we are talking about an intrinsic part of the story. They are part and parcel of the same thing.

			Whether the story is told in a straight line or fragmented or circular doesn’t matter. What we see and how we see it is evolving right before our eyes. You can see it in the new emerging technologies: the rapid growth of computer technology and the dramatic influence of computer-graphic imagery, along with the expanded impact of MTV, reality TV, Xbox, PlayStation, and all the new wireless LAN technology, have powerfully impacted every phase of visual communication. We may not be aware of it, but we’re in the middle of an evolution/revolution of screenwriting.

			I first became aware of this shift in visual storytelling in 1995. I had been teaching the nature of structure in workshops all over the world for almost twenty years when I saw three films that radically changed my perception. The first was Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino), and though I thought it was a “B” movie in terms of content, I saw immediately it was a new departure in storytelling. Everywhere I went in the world, people wanted to talk about Pulp Fiction. In many of my workshops, the participants asked if the film represented a new structure, and wanted to hear my opinion. People “dared” me to analyze it in terms of my structural paradigm; everybody, it seemed, thought Pulp Fiction was it; innovative in thought, concept, and execution, everything a revolutionary film should be.

			A few months later, I was in Mexico City conducting a screenwriting workshop for the Mexican government when I was invited to see a new film by the noted Mexican director, Jorge Fons, called El Callejón de los Milagros (Midaq Alley) featuring Salma Hayek in one of her first major film roles. The film seemed more novelistic than cinematic to me. There were four stories in the film, each one revolving around four or five different characters, all living, working, and loving on the same street, but linked by a key incident that shatters the relationship between the two main characters, a father and son. The incident affects all the characters in some way, and is woven into the structure as characters and events sometimes fold back on themselves in flashbacks of memories almost like a novel. The film, though high in melodrama, is unique, striking in terms of concept and execution.

			The more I thought about it, the more it seemed these two films were a kind of an indicator, or marker, influencing a possible future form of the screenplay. As I studied these two films, I understood once again what Jean Renoir called the “relationship between things.” Somehow, I sensed, there was a connection between the way a story is laid out in linear progression, and the way it’s laid out in a nonlinear presentation.

			Shortly after I returned, I was invited to a screening of The English Patient (Anthony Minghella). I loved it. The way the past and present are fused into one organic story line captivated me. What do these three films all have in common? I asked myself.

			I started from the obvious: even though they are all nonlinear in their stylistic approach, all have a beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. I remembered a line from the great Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s play Three Sisters that has always stayed with me: “The principle thing in life is its form. That which loses its form, ends itself, and it’s the same with our everyday existence.” Everything in life has a form. Every twenty-four-hour period is exactly the same, but different. The day begins in the morning, goes into the afternoon, and is followed by night. You can make further distinctions with that of course: early morning, later afternoon, late night, and so on. It’s the same with the twelve-month period we label a year; it’s always the same, but different. The same with our seasons: there is spring, summer, fall, and winter. It never changes. It’s always the same, but different. Remember the riddle that Sophocles presented for Oedipus: he asks what walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night? The answer: A human being.

			All these questions led me to believe that there was something in these films that I needed to explore. I started with Pulp Fiction. I got a copy of the screenplay. When I read the title page, it said that Pulp Fiction was really “three stories…about one story.” I turned the page and read two dictionary definitions of pulp: “a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter,” and “a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.” That’s certainly an accurate description of the film. But on the third page, I was surprised to find a Table of Contents. I thought that was rather odd; who writes a Table of Contents for a screenplay? Then I saw the film was broken down into five individual parts: Part I, the Prologue; Part II, Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace’s Wife; Part III, The Gold Watch; Part IV, The Bonnie Situation; and Part V, the Epilogue.

			As I studied the script, I saw that all three stories bounce off the key incident of Jules and Vincent Vega retrieving Marsellus Wallace’s briefcase from the four guys. This one incident became the hub of all three stories, and each story is structured as a whole, in linear fashion; it starts at the beginning of the action, goes into the middle, and then proceeds to the end. Each section is like a short story, presented from a different character’s point of view.

			If this key incident is the hub of the story, as I now understood it, then all the actions, reactions, thoughts, memories, or flashbacks, are tethered to this one incident. The entire film is structured around this one event, and then branches off in three different directions.

			Suddenly, it all made sense. Understanding “three stories about one story” allowed me to see the film as one unified whole. Pulp Fiction is three stories surrounded by a prologue and epilogue, what screenwriters call a “bookend” technique: The English Patient uses that same device. So do The Bridges of Madison County (Richard LaGravenese), Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett), and Saving Private Ryan (Robert Rodat).

			Now I began to see how Pulp Fiction was put together. The Prologue sets up the two characters, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), in a coffee shop discussing various types of robbery. When they finish their meals, they pull their guns and rob the place. The film freezes and we cut to the main titles. Then we cut into the middle of a conversation between Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta), driving and having an enlightening discussion about the relative merits of a Big Mac both here and abroad.

			Part I sets up the entire film and tells us everything we need to know; the two men are killers working for Marsellus Wallace; their job, their dramatic need, is to retrieve the briefcase. That’s the true beginning of the story, and by this reckoning, in Part I, Jules and Vincent arrive, state their position, kill the three guys, and only by the grace of God do they leave alive with Marvin. That’s the key incident of the story. They report back to Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vinnie takes Mia (Uma Thurman) out to dinner, and after she accidentally overdoses on some heroin, he revives her and they say good night, promising not to share what happened with anyone. Part II is about Butch (Bruce Willis) and his gold watch and what happens when he wins the fight, killing the other fighter, instead of losing it like he had agreed with Marsellus Wallace in Part I. Part III deals with cleaning up Marvin’s remains, which are splattered all over the car—a continuation of Part I. That’s followed by the Epilogue where Jules talks about his transformation and the significance of Divine Intervention in their lives, and then Pumpkin and Honey Bunny resume the holdup that began the film in the Prologue.

			Seeing that connection in Pulp Fiction, comparing it with El Callejón de los Milagros and The English Patient started me thinking about the changes occurring in the screenplay due to the impact of technology. In each case they shared something in common; besides the way the stories are laid out, besides the special effects and intriguing subject matter, all three films created an emotional response. At that moment, I realized that no matter how a film may be structured, the language of the cinema speaks directly to the heart, as Ingmar Bergman used to say. It doesn’t matter whether the story is told in a linear or nonlinear form; it doesn’t matter whether the story is told with ingenious special effects, or branded with the visual brilliance of the director or the great acting of the actors or the broad sweep of the photography or the poetry of the editing. When you really get right down to it, there’s only one thing that holds the whole thing together.

			And that’s the story.

			Movies are all about story. “Nothing can be made out of nothing,” King Lear muses in the clarity of his madness. No matter what the framework, ideas, concepts, jargon, or analytical comments are, whether the movie proceeds in a straight line or circle, or is fractured and splintered into little pieces, it doesn’t make a bit of difference. No matter who we are, or where we live, or what generation we may belong to, the singular aspects of storytelling remain the same. It’s been that way since Plato created stories out of shadows on the wall. The art of telling a story with pictures exists beyond time, culture, and language. Walk into the Elmira caves in Spain and look at the rock paintings, or into the world of Hieronymus Bosch and the early Flemish Primitives, or walk through the gallery of the Accademia Museum in Venice, and gaze upon those magnificent panels, and you enter a grand view of visual storytelling.

			No matter how evolved or revolutionary or fractured or fragmented the story might be, regardless of incredible computer graphics or technological innovations, all screenplays reside within the context of structure; that is its essential form, its foundation. Just look at Terminator 2: Judgment Day (James Cameron and William Wisher, Jr.), Spider-Man 2 (Alvin Sargent), The Incredibles (Brad Bird), The Bourne Supremacy (Tony Gilroy), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Charlie Kaufman), or The Manchurian Candidate (Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris); they are all told within the paradigm of dramatic structure.

			I wondered how I would go about writing a nonlinear film. Many of the scripts being written today seem to be employing certain novelistic techniques—stream of consciousness, flashbacks, memories, and voiceover commentary—in order to get closer to the main character, to get inside their heads. As different as all these films are, the one common bond they all share is a strong and solid sense of structure; they all have a beginning, middle, and end, and the story revolves around a key incident which anchors the storylines together. Courage Under Fire (Patrick Duncan), The Usual Suspects (Christopher McQuarrie), Lone Star (John Sayles), Magnolia (Paul Thomas Anderson), American Beauty (Alan Ball), Memento (Christopher Nolan), and Groundhog Day (Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis) are good examples and if you study them you’ll see they all revolve around one key incident. The key incident is the hub of the story line, the engine that powers the story forward and reveals to us what the story is about.

			The Bourne Supremacy revolves around the key incident that Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is trying to remember, the incident that happened in Berlin, where he killed the politician and his wife. The key incident in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is when Clementine (Kate Winslet) ends the relationship by erasing all memories of Joel (Jim Carrey). This incident sets up the entire story and we experience what’s happening at the same time as the main character. What happened during those three missing days in The Manchurian Candidate is what the whole movie is about. It is the key incident in the story line.

			In The English Patient, there are two story lines: one in the present, in which Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) has been found burned almost beyond recognition, his body swathed in bandages. As he journeys to the hospital, he begins his relationship with his nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche). He muses about the past and his relationship with the married Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) and we flash back and forth between time past and time present, seeing both relationships develop. Anthony Minghella structured the present story from beginning to end, and structured Almásy and Katharine’s story from beginning to end, and then inserted various parts of the relationship wherever it was applicable to move the story forward. It works very effectively.

			What happens if the structure doesn’t work? Basically, a screenplay without structure has no direction. It wanders around, like a series of episodes searching for itself. A film like 21 Grams (Guillermo Arriaga), for example, while a dynamic, interesting attempt depicting the effect of a key incident (the car accident) on the lives of several characters, doesn’t work in my mind because there’s no structural unity in the film as the story unfolds, only a series of sequences slapped together in a seemingly haphazard, nonlinear way. There’s no cohesiveness to the story. Robert Altman’s A Wedding, or American Hot Wax (Floyd Mutrux), while interesting ideas, do not seem to have any clear-cut line of dramatic action or development, so whatever structural aspects there are only seem to highlight a dramatic situation, not a story line. The throughline of narrative action in these films are like two parallel lines that never meet.

			A good screenplay has a strong line of dramatic action; it goes somewhere, moves forward, step-by-step, toward its resolution. It has direction, defined as a line of development. If you’re going on a vacation or trip, you don’t plan it by going to the airport, finding parking, walking to the closest terminal, seeing what flights are available, and then figuring out where you’re going, do you? When you take a trip, you’re going somewhere. You have a destination. You start here and end there.

			That’s what structure is all about. It’s a tool that lets you shape your screenplay with maximum dramatic value (MDV). As stated earlier, structure is what holds everything together; all the action, characters, plot, incidents, episodes, and events that make up your screenplay.

			The late Richard Feynman, the Nobel prize-winning physicist from Caltech, has pointed out that the laws of nature are so simple it’s hard to see them. In order to do so, we have to rise above our level of complexity and understanding. For example, human beings had been observing natural phenomena for almost 400 years before Newton understood that “for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” That’s Newton’s Third Law of Motion.

			What could be simpler than that?


				THE EXERCISE

				 					This is a workbook that provides you with the opportunity of improving your screenwriting abilities. Try this little exercise on structure. Choose two of these movies: Sideways, The Hours, Thelma & Louise, The English Patient, Ordinary People, Collateral, and The Bourne Supremacy. See if you can analyze the structure of each film.

				Take a sheet of paper and, by free-association, see if you can break each film down into a beginning, middle, and end. Just write it all down. Don’t worry about whether you’re right or not, just jot down your thoughts, words, and ideas about the flow of the story. No one’s going to read this but you and it will give you good insight into the direction of the story.

				Then, off the top of your head, just write down any idea that you might like to work on as a screenplay. See if you can structure it into a beginning, middle, and end. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a linear or nonlinear idea. Just lay it down in a couple of pages. Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. Do it, then put it away and forget about it.

				The Workbook is experiential; the more you put in, the more you get out.

			The Paradigm


			 				“Form follows structure; structure doesn’t follow form.”

				 					 						—I. M. Pei

						Architect





			A screenplay is unique: as a story told in pictures, utilizing both dialogue and description to move the story forward, the narrative line is held together within the context of a dramatic structure that anchors the story line in place. There is a beginning, middle, and end. We spoke about context as being “the space” that holds something in place, that something being the content—all those scenes, sequences, action, dialogue, characters, and more, that make up the story line. Context doesn’t change. Content changes.

			Structure is form.

			“A screenplay,” as William Goldman says, “is structure, structure, structure.” To illustrate the context of structure—what it looks like—we build a model, just like an architect builds a model to scale so we can “see” what a building looks like. We build the context of dramatic structure by illustrating it with the paradigm. A paradigm is defined as “a model, an example, or a conceptual scheme.” It is really a tool or guideline, a roadmap through the story of the screenwriting process.

			The more I learn about the paradigm, the more amazed I am at how important it really is. I conceived the paradigm after writing nine original screenplays and reading in excess of two thousand screenplays and more than a hundred novels looking for material during my stint as head of the story department at Cinemobile Systems. Most of what I read was not very good; as a matter of fact, I only found forty out of two thousand screenplays to submit to our financial partners. Since then, I have read, analyzed, and worked with screenwriters on thousands and thousands of screenplays in several different languages.

			The one thing that all good screenplays have in common is structure. Structure is like a system; in science, systems are referred to as either being open or closed. A closed system is like a rock—it takes nothing from its environment and gives nothing back. There is no interchange between the rock and whatever its surroundings may be.

			An open system is like a city: it interacts with its environment, and there exists a natural interchange between them. The city depends on the earth of the surrounding areas for food and raw materials, and people in those areas depend upon the city for jobs, trade, and other services. There is a give-and-take exchange between the city and its surroundings.

			Writing a screenplay is very much an open system. You plan what you’re going to write—for example, “Grace leaves Bill’s apartment and takes a long walk through the city”—but sometimes it doesn’t work out that way. Grace “tells” you she doesn’t want to go on a long walk through the city—she wants to listen to music, go dancing, have an apple martini, and be around people. And if that ever happens, you better listen. That spark of spontaneity that jolts an unexpected image or thought or sequence or line of dialogue is what makes the creative process an open system. But you’ve got to be open to receive the new ideas and allow the process to emerge from your creative self. You can’t let any preconceived notions or ideas hamper you from taking another direction in the screenwriting process. The writing experience should always be an adventure, and we’re never really quite sure how the creative process is going to reveal itself to us.

			That’s what teaching is all about. It, too, is an open system. The teacher presents the material to the students; they listen, question, doubt, argue, and assimilate whatever connects with them. The way they listen can create a possible breakthrough in the understanding of craft, or an expansion of the original material, which in turn could evolve into the story taking a new direction. If we’re open to the process, the story may take an unseen “twist,” expanding the story line or characters, even adding new characters and subplots. The structure of the story may even change.

			Over the years, I’ve defined the paradigm in many ways. If we could hang a screenplay on the wall like a painting, we could “see” what it looks like. For example, if you wanted to illustrate the paradigm of a table how would you define it? What is a table? A top with four legs. But that covers a lot of ground; there are many different types of tables: a short table, long table, high table, low table, or narrow table. There can also be a square table, round table, rectangular table, or octagonal table. You could also have a chrome table, wrought-iron table, wood table, glass table, plastic table, and so on. As you can see, the paradigm of a table does not change; it is “a top with four legs.” That is its nature; that’s the model of a table.

			If you’re building a new house, or remodeling an old one, you hire an architect or designer to draw blueprints, preliminary plans, and working plans. But if you’re like I am, you may have trouble visualizing what the house is going to look like when it’s finished based only on a blueprint. Lines on paper do not really show you the walls, doors, and ceilings. Some of us need to see a model before we can make any kind of aesthetic decision. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a house, office building, swimming pool, tennis court, car, bus, or boat, sometimes we just need to see it. In other words, we need a model.

			In the same way, the paradigm is a model, an example, a conceptual scheme of what a screenplay looks like. If we could hang it on the wall like a painting, and see it in its wholeness, this it what it would look like:





			Let’s explore the context of the paradigm. Here’s how it works: If a screenplay is “a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure,” what is a story? And what do all stories have in common?

			A beginning, middle, and end—though as mentioned, not always in that order. Because we’re dealing with a dramatic medium, the beginning corresponds to Act I, the middle to Act II, the end to Act III.

			The average length of a film is about two hours long. Since one page of screenplay equals approximately one minute of screen time, the average screenplay is about one hundred and twenty pages long. Some are longer, some shorter, but most are close to this length. The contracts being written by most major Hollywood studios and production companies today usually stipulate that movies in production cannot be longer than two hours, eight minutes. That means approximately one hundred and twenty-eight pages. And you are not the exception.

			You may want to check this out. Read a screenplay, then see the movie and determine if it’s true or not! Check your watch. You should be reading as many screenplays as you can to familiarize yourself with the visual presentation of the story. If you’re seriously interested in writing a screenplay, you should be reading all the scripts you can get your hands on, and seeing all the movies you can afford—in a movie theater, if possible. If not, then rent or buy the DVD.

			If you don’t have access to any screenplays, go online and search the Web. There are many Web sites devoted to the screenplay. At some sites, you can download scripts free of charge—sites like simplyscripts.com or Drew’s Script-O-Rama.com or dailyscript.com. Or, do a Google or Yahoo search for “screenplays” and see what comes up. There are many, many sites and many, many screenplays you can download.

			It breaks down this way: Aristotle states there are three unities of action—time, place, and action. Act I is a unit of dramatic (or comedic) action. It begins at the beginning, page one, with the opening shot or sequence, and goes through to the end of Plot Point I. It is approximately twenty to thirty pages long and is held together by the dramatic context known as the Set-Up.

			Act II is a unit of dramatic action that begins at the end of Plot Point I and extends through the end of Plot Point II, and it is approximately fifty or sixty pages long. It is held together by the dramatic context known as Confrontation. Act II is all about conflict and obstacles confronted and overcome. All drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action, and without action, you have no character. Without character, you have no story, and without story, you ain’t got no screenplay. If you know your character’s dramatic need—that is, what he or she wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay—then you can create obstacles to that need and your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need.

			Act III is also a unit of dramatic or comedic action; it goes from the end of Plot Point II, approximately page eighty or ninety, to the end of the screenplay, roughly page one hundred and twenty. It, too, is roughly twenty to thirty pages long and is held together with the dramatic context known as Resolution. It’s important to remember that resolution means solution and in this unit of action your story is resolved. Not necessarily wrapped up neatly, but complete in whatever way you choose. In this, the preparation, or preplanning stage of writing the screenplay, what you need to know about the resolution of your story is basically what happens to your character at the end of the story.

			Does your character live or die, succeed or fail, win the race or not, return safely home or not, get married or divorced? Resolution means solution and Act III is all about how your story is resolved. If you don’t know how to resolve your story, ask yourself how you would like it to be resolved, regardless of how effective it is, or whether “they”—those unknown film executives who live in your head—would like it. It’s your story so you get to choose how it’s going to end. And that will be your starting point.

			When Stuart Beattie was preparing his script of Collateral, he knew that Max (Jamie Foxx) had to stand up to the hired killer to save his life as well as to redeem himself; otherwise, he would just be another murder statistic on the streets of L.A. That’s the character arc that Max had to go through in order to realize that his “someday dream” would never happen unless he made it happen. Beattie structured the evolution of the character just like he did the story and it’s a good illustration of using the paradigm as a structural template.

			In many films, like American Beauty (Alan Ball), or The Bourne Supremacy (Tony Gilroy), Act I is anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two pages long. We’re not talking numbers here, we’re talking form: beginning, middle, and end. Act II can be anywhere from fifty to sixty pages, plus or minus a few pages, and there are times when Act III is fifteen to twenty pages long. The paradigm, remember, is only a model, an example or conceptual scheme. It’s not something that’s laid down in concrete. As a matter of fact, the great thing about structure is that it’s fluid; like a tree in the wind, it bends, but doesn’t break.

			Act I is a unit of dramatic action that sets up your story. In the first twenty to thirty pages of screenplay, you must set up your story. You must introduce your main characters, establish your dramatic premise (what the story is about), create the dramatic situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and set up the relationships between your character’s professional life, his or her personal life (relationships), and his or her private life (private time and hobbies). Most, if not all, of these elements need to be established in this first unit of dramatic action.

			Everything in Act I focuses on setting up your story. You don’t have time for cheap tricks or clever scenes or cute dialogue if they don’t move the story forward, establish the relationships between the characters, or reveal information about the characters. You’ve got to set up your story immediately, from page one, word one. The purpose of each scene is either to move the story forward or reveal information about the character. Anything that does not serve these two functions should be dropped. Act I sets up the story and holds each scene and sequence in place. Context, remember, is the space that holds the content in place; all those scenes, dialogue, description, shots, and special effects that make up a screenplay. Everything in this unit of action sets up everything that will follow.

			A perfect example is Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh). After the brief prologue establishing the history of the Ring, we follow Gandalf as he enters the Shire. There, we meet Frodo, Bilbo Baggins, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, and see the Hobbit’s life in the Shire. We learn that Bilbo found the Ring, wants to leave the Shire to write his book, and uses the Ring to disappear from his birthday party. That causes Gandalf to research the history of the Ring, and soon realizes the danger that the Ring brings with it. Already, the dark horsemen of Sauron are searching the Shire for it. Frodo reluctantly inherits the Ring when Bilbo vanishes and Gandalf convinces Frodo of the need to leave the Shire. So Frodo and Sam set out on their journey—their mission: to travel to Mordor, land of the enemy, and destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged. The act of Frodo and Sam leaving the relative safety of the Shire now takes us into Act II where they encounter obstacle after obstacle before they reach their journey’s end. (As a side note, the context of Part II, The Two Towers, is all about confrontation and the overcoming of obstacles.) Everything is set up in this first unit of dramatic action. We establish relationships between the main characters: we know who the main character is (Frodo), what the story is about (destroying the Ring in the fire), and what the dramatic situation is (Sauron, rallying the forces of evil to destroy Middle Earth).





			In Act I of The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont), the opening sequence sets up the three threads of visual action: we see Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) sitting in his car, drunk. He pulls out a gun and sloppily inserts the bullets. Then we intercut to his trial where he is charged with the murder of his wife and her lover, then see his wife and her lover preparing to have sex. Together, these three visual threads of dramatic action set up the entire story line: Andy’s wife and lover are murdered, Andy is convicted of the murders, and he enters prison to serve “two life sentences.” We enter Shawshank Penitentiary as Andy Dufresne enters. We meet another convicted murderer, Red (Morgan Freeman), and he explains in voiceover who he is and how he met Andy. We are with Andy when the warden sets forth the rules of Shawshank. We watch as Andy is hosed down, deloused, and enters his cell. The doors slam shut. Welcome to Shawshank.

			Night comes, the fat man breaks down, and is beaten and taken to the infirmary. Andy is assigned to the laundry room, is hustled by “the girls”—the deadly gang of gay men—and we see him gradually adjust to prison life. At the end of Act I, he’s in the yard, meets up with Red (“I hear you’re a man who can get things done.”), and they establish their relationship. The whole story is set up in Act I.

			Which then brings us to the next question: how do we get from Act I, the Set-Up, into Act II, the Confrontation? And how do we get from Act II, the Confrontation, into Act III, the Resolution? The answer: to create a Plot Point at the end of Act I and Act II. A Plot Point is defined as any incident, episode or event that “hooks” into the action and spins it around into another direction, in this case, into either Act II or Act III. Direction, of course, is a “line of development.” We are moving the story forward, from Act I, the Set-Up, into Act II, the Confrontation, and then into Act III, the Resolution.

			Over the years, I’ve heard many questions about the Plot Point. Does it have to be a major event or dramatic incident? Can it be a scene or sequence? The answer is yes to both questions. A Plot Point can be anything you want it to be; it is a story progression point. It can be as simple as an action: John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) arriving at the deserted fort in Dances With Wolves (Michael Blake). It can be a line of dialogue, or short scene done completely in silence like Plot Point I in Witness (Earl Wallace and Bill Kelly): The ten-year-old Amish boy who sees a murder take place pointing out the killer to John Book (Harrison Ford) in the police station. It can be an action sequence: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) escaping from the customs agent in Naples in The Bourne Supremacy. It can be a dramatic sequence as in Thelma & Louise: Thelma and Louise are driving to the mountains for the weekend, but a brief stop at a bar turns into an attempted rape and results in a murder, setting the two women on the run.

			In An Unmarried Woman, one of my favorite teaching films, written and directed by Paul Mazursky, Act I establishes the marriage of Erica (Jill Clayburgh). We see her jogging with her husband, Martin (Michael Murphy), sending their daughter off to school, then enjoying a “quickie” with her husband. She goes to her part-time job in an art gallery, gets hustled by Charlie the painter (Cliff Gorman), meets her best friends for lunch. During their conversation, we learn that most of them are divorced, unhappy, and bitter about men and declare their envy of Erica’s seventeen-year marriage. Mazursky sets up Erica’s character in the first act, doing it with visual bits and pieces of information about who she is and what she wants.

			From the outside, Erica’s marriage looks fine. Then, about twenty or twenty-five minutes into the film, her husband suddenly breaks down and bursts into tears.

			“What is it?” Erica asks, concerned. “What’s wrong?”

			Martin turns to her and tells her that he’s met another woman, fallen in love, and wants a divorce. One scene, one line of dialogue, and the entire story shifts into another direction. No longer is she married; now she is divorced, an unmarried woman. It is the true beginning of the story.

			That’s an illustration of a Plot Point—an incident, episode, or event that “hooks” into the action and spins it around into another direction, in this case, Act II. It moves the story forward. Act I sets her up as the married woman, Act II reveals her as an unmarried woman and shows how she copes with that, and Act III dramatizes her life as a single person, able to live life on her own terms without leaning or depending on a man.

			Here’s what it looks like on the paradigm.





			Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story. A Plot Point can be anything you want it to be as long as it moves the action forward. It is a function of character, leading us from Act I into Act II or from Act II into Act III. It should be noted here that there can be many Plot Points in your screenplay but at this stage in the writing process, the preparation, we are only focusing on Plot Points I and II; they are the anchor points that hold the elements of your story line in place.

			Before you can write one word on paper, you must know four things: your ending, your beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. Only when you know these four elements can you start to “build” or structure your story line.

			Act II is also a unit of dramatic or comedic action, held together by the context known as Confrontation. Act II goes from the Plot Point at the end of Act I to the end of Plot Point II and is approximately fifty to sixty pages long. During this section of your screenplay, your character will be challenged by numerous obstacles to achieve his or her dramatic need. If you know your character’s dramatic need—what your character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay—then you can create the necessary obstacles and your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need. As mentioned earlier, all drama is conflict—without conflict there is no action; without action, there is no character; without character there is no story; and of course, without story, you have no screenplay. Obstacles can either be internal (fearing a confrontation) or external (caught in a dangerous situation like Jamie Foxx in Collateral). Mostly, they are a combination of both.

			Act II is often the most difficult act to write because it is the longest unit of dramatic action. (With the new material presented in this workbook, Act II is broken down into two workable units of action.) In Act II, every scene you write, every shot you describe, every sequence you devise is held together within the context of Confrontation. In Thelma & Louise, the two women run from the crime they committed because they panic and don’t know what else to do. Once on the run, they encounter obstacle after obstacle: they’ve run from the scene of a crime, don’t have enough money, have very little gas, and are scared. They encounter all kinds of obstacles, either internal (fear and uncertainty of what they’ve done and what’s going to happen to them) or external (the police want them for questioning).

			Act II of An Unmarried Woman deals with Erica as an unmarried woman after being in what she thought was a “good” marriage for seventeen years. She must learn how to adapt and deal with her new life. She feels betrayed, abandoned, angry, and bitter. It’s an enormous change for her, and she finds adjusting difficult. She enters therapy, learns how to be a single parent, overcomes her anger at men in general (focusing it instead on her husband, where it belongs), and begins to experiment sexually.

			Near the end of Act II she meets Saul (Alan Bates), an artist, at the art gallery where she works and has sex with him, but refuses to see him again, saying she’s still experimenting and doesn’t want to enter into any kind of relationship, especially a serious one. “Nothing personal,” she adds. A few nights later she meets him again at a party. They talk, enjoy each other’s company, and decide to leave the party together. Despite what she had said at the end of their sexual encounter, she likes him and he likes her, and soon she feels comfortable enough to spend more time with him. The Plot Point at the end of Act II is when they decide to leave the party together; it occurs about eighty or ninety minutes into the film and is the incident that “spins the action around into another direction”—in this case, Act III. The third act focuses on Erica’s new relationship with Saul. This is the way it looks on the paradigm:





			The Plot Point at the end of Act II “spins the story around” into Act III. It is that incident, episode, or event that “hooks” into the action and leads the action into Act III, the Resolution.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne has learned who actually murdered his wife and her lover, a crime for which he has been convicted and served time. He wants the warden to help him get a new trial; he’s served some nineteen years for a crime he didn’t commit. The Warden has his own reasons for keeping Andy in prison, and to make sure, he has the young man who gave Andy the new information murdered. Andy knows now that he’s not going to get out; he’s going to spend the rest of his life in Shawshank unless he does something about it. He is guilty, yes—not of murder but of being a bad husband, and that’s all. He has served his time. If The Shawshank Redemption is about anything, it’s about hope.

			So Andy chooses a time and escapes—something, we learn, he’d been planning for years. The escape sequence is a brilliant moment of filmmaking and is the Plot Point at the end of Act II. After he escapes, we have to resolve the story. Red gets his parole, finds the rock Andy left for him, breaks his parole, and travels by bus to Mexico. “I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.”

			The function of Plot Point II is to serve the story progression. Like Plot Point I, Plot Point II can either be a decision, a line of dialogue, a scene, or an action sequence—anything you want it to be. In Thelma & Louise, the characters have encountered many obstacles by this point: they’ve been ripped off, the police are on their trail, they’re heading for Mexico with an all-states bulletin out for their arrest. Throughout the Second Act, we’ve been bombarded with the soundtrack, beautifully orchestrated by Hans Zimmer, that reflects and adds to the emotional state of the two characters. Now, as they race their way through the desert landscapes of New Mexico and Arizona, Louise realizes this may be their last night alive on this Earth. She knows that her act of killing Harlan at the end of Act I will probably cost the two women their lives.

			Overcome by this knowledge, Louise is driving through the vast, magnificent landscape of Monument Valley in Utah. It is a gorgeous night; the moon is full, the high plateaus silhouetted in light and shadow. Louise pulls off the road to stare at this beautiful sight, probably the last time she will ever pass this way again. The music stops and on the soundtrack there is only the silence of the landscape, the whisper of a slight wind, accompanied by the night sounds of the valley. The silence speaks volumes and is extremely effective.

			Louise gets out of the car, takes a few steps off the road, and stares in beauty and wonder at the magnificent sight in front of her. And, as she says in a later scene, she now understands that killing Harlan may be the actual cause of their death.

			Thelma steps up behind her. “What’s goin’ on?” she asks, breaking the moment of silence. “Nothing,” Louise replies.

			This one moment, brief, silent, devoid of dialogue or music, is a glimpse into their sure and immediate future. This moment is Plot Point II. From then on to the end of the screenplay, Thelma and Louise are racing against time and circumstance. They don’t make it to Mexico; they only get as far as the edge of the Grand Canyon. It is here that they realize their destiny. With the Grand Canyon in front of them, and the elite Arizona SWAT team behind them, the two women know they don’t want to spend the rest of their natural lives in prison, or be gunned down. Given their choice, they prefer to take their own lives. They grasp their hands together, Louise bears down on the gas pedal, and they leap into the chasm of the Grand Canyon together.

			On the paradigm it looks like this:





			Do all films have Plot Points? Films that “work” have a strong, organic structure with their Plot Points clearly woven and defined within the context of their story.

			Which brings us to Act III. Act III is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately thirty pages long and goes from the Plot Point at the end of Act II to the end of the screenplay. Act III deals with the dramatic context of Resolution. What is the solution to your story? Does your character live or die, succeed or fail, go on a trip or not, get the promotion or not, get married or divorced, survive the test or not, get away safely or not? You must know what the resolution of your story line is. I don’t necessarily mean the specific scene or sequence at the end of the screenplay but what happens to resolve the dramatic conflict. If you don’t know the ending of your story, who does?

			I recently had the opportunity of working with some of the space scientists from JPL and NASA, and I observed that designing a mission follows the same principles as structuring a screenplay. In a scientific mission the first thing they do is declare what the undertaking is; they state their intention, clearly defining what they want to accomplish or achieve. For example, they want to send a manned exposition to Mars and take soil density readings and return, or to explore the atmospheric components of Io, one of the moons of Jupiter. Each project begins with a destination and a purpose. In the same way, you need to know how your story ends, the Resolution. That’s where you’re going; that is your destination.

			When you reach Plot Point II, there are usually two or three things left unresolved in your story. What are they? Can you define and articulate them? What’s going to happen to the main character? In Thelma & Louise, two things need to be resolved: one, do they escape safely to Mexico or not, and two, do they live or die? Act III shows us, scene by scene, how their time runs out and how they choose to end their lives together. In The Shawshank Redemption, when Andy escapes at Plot Point II, we need to know what happens to him—does he get away safely? When Red receives the postcard from Mexico, we know Andy has accomplished that. But what’s going to happen to Red? Those two story points are resolved in Act III. In An Unmarried Woman, Erica learns to be a single person and create her own identity.

			Structure, as you can see, dramatically establishes the relationship between the parts and the whole. Each part is a separate and complete unit of dramatic action. Act I is a whole as well as a part. It is a whole because it has a beginning, middle, and an end. It begins at the beginning and ends at the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Act II is a whole as well as a part and begins at the end of Plot Point I and goes through the end of Plot Point II. Act III is a whole as well as a part, beginning at the end of Plot Point II and going to the end of your screenplay. Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution is the context that holds your story together. It is the structural foundation of your screenplay, “a linear arrangement of related incidents, episodes, and events, leading to a dramatic resolution.”


				THE EXERCISE

				Before you can express your story dramatically, you must know four things: 1) the ending, 2) the beginning, 3) Plot Point I, and 4) Plot Point II. These four elements are the structural foundation of your screenplay. You “hang” your entire story around these four elements.

				Here’s how it works. Suppose you take an idea and sculpt it into a subject. For example: A YOUNG WOMAN, a painter, in an unhappy marriage, enrolls in an art class and has an affair with her teacher. Against her will, she falls in love with him, then learns she is pregnant. Torn between her husband and lover, she decides to leave both and raise her child by herself.

				The first thing to do with your subject—the action and character—is to structure it. What’s the ending of your story? Where the young woman goes off to have her child by herself, leaving both her husband and lover, much like Nora in Ibsen’s play A Doll’s House. That’s the end.

				What about the beginning? We want the audience to know that the young woman is in an unhappy marriage, so we must show this. What kind of scene or sequence would reveal an unhappy marriage? Is the woman’s husband unable to communicate with her? Does he take her for granted? Is he distant and weak? Is he flirting with other women? Having affairs? What kind of scene would communicate that to the audience? When they’re in bed? At a party? Preparing for an evening out? The great Italian director, Michelangelo Antonioni opened his great film L’Eclisse in a living room at dawn. The room is a mess, the curtains are drawn, ashtrays are overflowing, dirty glasses sit on the table, and there’s a fan in the foreground that whirs incessantly. It’s the only sound in the room. Vittoria (Monica Vitti) and her lover Riccardo (Francisco Rabal) stare at each other in silence. They have nothing left to say to each other; everything has been said that could have been said. We see immediately their relationship is over.

				Find a way to open with a scene that will illustrate, or reveal, your dramatic premise. Think about it. Try out several different ways and see what works the best. Does it take place during the day or at night? At work or at home?

				What happens at Plot Point I? If Act I sets up the marriage, the Plot Point at the end of Act I might be the woman enrolling in the art class, leading to the relationship with her art teacher; it is the Plot Point that “spins” the story into another direction. It is the true beginning of your story.

				What about Plot Point II? If Plot Point I is the beginning of the relationship, Plot Point II might be where she learns she’s pregnant. This discovery precipitates the action that leads to the resolution, the “solution” of the story: she resolves her dilemma by leaving both husband and lover.

				Once you know these four elements—ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II—draw the paradigm:





				This is what your idea might “look like” when it is structured. The paradigm, remember, is a conceptual tool, enabling you to “see” your story line clearly. It gives you an overview.

				You don’t have to be too specific; just lay it out in broad, general strokes. You can fill in the details later.

				The exercise is designed to prepare you to structure your own idea so you can move into the next stage in the screenwriting process.

				It is the first step in preparing your screenplay.

			Not too long ago, I was taking a yoga class with a well-known television actor. We started talking and after a while the subject, as always, turned to the movies, then to screenwriting. He told me that he had a great idea for a screenplay.

			“What’s it about?” I asked.

			“Well,” he began, “it’s about this guy in the Sahara Desert. We open at sunrise with a long shot of dust rising out of the desert. Then we see a Jeep racing across the sand. Suddenly, the engine sputters, coughs, and finally dies. The man climbs out of the Jeep, looks around, and jerks open the hood. Then we hear strange noises coming from behind a distant dune. Suddenly, several racing camels sweep down over the hill. They see him and stop. They look at each other surrounded by the silence.”

			He looked at me, enthused. “Isn’t that a great idea?”

			“It’s a great opening,” I replied. “What happens next?”

			“I haven’t figured it out yet. But it’ll all come out later, in the plot.”

			Sure. How many times have you heard that before? What plot?

			I nodded in understanding. Yeah. Sure.

			I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard that same scenario from aspiring screenwriters. Of course, they can’t tell you any more about the story because they don’t know any more about it. They haven’t defined it to themselves yet.

			What’s it about? Briefly, in terms of describing the story line, what’s your story about, and who is it about? Can you define it, articulate it in a few sentences? It’s something I emphasize over and over again in my workshops and seminars:

			“If you don’t know your story, who does?”

			Writing a screenplay is more about the journey than the destination. It is an ongoing, evolving process that changes day to day. You prepare the material in stages or steps. First, you need an idea, which is broken down into a subject, the action and character. Then, when you have your subject, you can structure it on the paradigm with the four anchoring points that hold your story together: the ending, beginning, Plot Points I and II. You really can’t write anything with any degree of certainty until you know those four things; they are the foundation of your story line, the glue that holds your story together.

			Only when you know these four elements can you begin to tell your story in a narrative fashion. In fact, the word “narrative” means an arrangement, or sequence of events or happenings, factual or imagined, and implies a sense of direction. The story progresses from beginning to end. And direction, remember, is a line of development.

			Putting your story down on paper is essential because it’s a necessary stage in fleshing out and developing your idea. How accurate it will be in terms of the finished screenplay five or six months from now, or how good or bad it is, is totally irrelevant.

			That’s why I think it’s necessary to write a short, four-page treatment. A treatment is defined as a narrative synopsis of your story line. Some dialogue can be included if it helps to shed light upon the lives of your characters. I have my students write four-page treatments because it helps articulate and define the structural events that hold the story together.

			Why is this necessary? Because it allows you to take those unformed, fragmented ideas that are running around your head and put them down on paper. It sharpens the details of your story and clarifies the relationships you’ve been thinking about.

			I call this a “kick in the ass” exercise, because you’re taking this amorphous idea, or notion, and trying to give it form. It’s an important step in the screenwriting process.

			It should be mentioned that in Hollywood, a treatment, any kind of a treatment, is only a writer’s tool; it’s just part of the ongoing journey of writing a screenplay. Writing a treatment and hoping it will sell, is only a pipe dream. A treatment is not a screenplay. Don’t expect the treatment you write to be sold, or optioned, especially if you’re a new or aspiring screenwriter. In television, it’s a different story; there, treatments, or beat sheets, or outlines, may be developed in conjunction with the production executive and the network. But we’re talking about screenplays here, and in Hollywood only a finished screenplay can be sent out to studios and production companies.

			It’s also a different story in Europe and in some Latin American countries. In Europe, for example, a treatment is often sold or optioned by members of the Film Commission or Ministry of Culture, and then the writer is given a nominal sum of money to develop the treatment into a screenplay. What happens to the screenplay after it’s written, of course, is anybody’s guess. Sometimes, the treatment is optioned, a screenplay written, and then it simply sits on a shelf somewhere gathering dust for whatever reason—a director is not available or doesn’t like the material or the budget is too high or there’s been a change in the policy or members of the Film Commission. Whatever. I hear this over and over and over again from European and Latin American screenwriters. The stories are legion.

			Writing a four-page treatment is not something you have to do, but if you take the time to prepare your material correctly, it pays off during the actual writing process.

			I learned this the hard way. When I was making documentaries for David L. Wolper, I was a staff writer and wrote, produced, researched, directed, or was associated with more than 125 television network documentaries. After four and a half years, I felt it was time for a change. I left Wolper Productions and went looking for a job in feature film production, actively seeking a job as a production executive. But nothing was available at the time. Things were tight. Then, after several months, I was asked to rewrite a documentary feature, called Spree, directed by Walon Green, whom I had worked with at Wolper Productions. Now the Executive Producer of TV’s Law & Order, Walon had co-written The Wild Bunch with Sam Peckinpah, the writer–director who was a mentor to me and who had been so instrumental in my understanding of the screenplay.

			After writing Spree, I realized I could possibly earn a living as a writer while waiting for some kind of a production job. So, I became a screenwriter living the life of a freelancer—a job here, a job there, just enough to make ends meet. It went on like this for the next seven years, during which time I wrote nine original screenplays. Two were produced. The next four scripts I wrote were optioned, meaning a producer paid me a certain sum of money so he or she had the exclusive right to produce the movie for a certain length of time, usually two years. At the end of that period, the rights reverted back to me. The three others I wrote went nowhere. Everybody told me how much they liked them, but nothing happened with them and they still sit on my shelf. “Hollywood,” said novelist Dorothy Parker, “is the only place where you can die from encouragement.”

			The way I worked was simple. I would get an idea and research it—get books from the library and talk to people about it until I felt comfortable with the material. Then I would do my character work, write character biographies, talk to more people, look at pictures, read any first-hand accounts from diaries of that period. Next I would sit down and start writing. I used to call it “hitting my head against the typewriter.” I always came up with a script, but the cost, both physically and emotionally, was very high. It was a slow and painful process, and after years of working this way, I began to look at screenwriting as something I had to do rather than something I wanted to do. There’s a big difference between the two; one is a negative experience, the other positive. While it’s important to see both sides, writing is too hard a job, too demanding a task, to color it with a negative or painful experience.

			One of the scripts I wrote during this time was a painful, but ultimately beneficial experience. It was a western about a man named Balinger who rode with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, an “unchanged man in a changing time,” as Peckinpah used to say. But when Butch and Sundance left for South America in 1902, my character, Balinger, refused to believe the times were changing. He stayed behind, pulled a couple of holdups, was caught, sentenced to prison, escaped, and continued to do the only thing he knew how to do: rob banks.

			Balinger was a character who was at odds with the times. On one hand, he was born ten years too late; on the other, he was born ten years too early. That was the basic idea. He was a character who didn’t belong.

			In the back story, Balinger robs a bank, gets caught, and is sentenced to prison. I wanted to open the script with an exciting sequence of Balinger escaping from prison, having served four years of a ten-year sentence. After he escapes, he teams up with his old partner, adds a few young members to his gang, and begins to pursue his old way of life. But of course, times have changed. Banks have started using checks, stocks and bonds are negotiable securities, and with something called the telephone you could call from Denver to San Francisco. Balinger couldn’t understand that. After planning a robbery, his expectations are thwarted because nothing works. In one job he gets a bundle of checks, along with a thousand dollar bill he can’t cash. Another job nets only a few hundred dollars in coins and some stock certificates.

			At this point, he doesn’t know what to do or where to go, and the Pinkerton detectives chasing him are closing in. Balinger knows his time is at an end and talks about joining Butch and Sundance in Bolivia. One last job—a big one, he thinks—will do it. So, the motley group rides to a town in Washington State, on the banks of Puget Sound. They pull the job, but in the ensuing shoot-out, the money is left behind and Balinger chooses to end his own life by deliberately colliding with the Coast Guard cutter chasing him. His last words were something like, “Maybe Butch and Sundance had the right idea.”

			That’s about all I knew when I sat down in “the pit” and started writing. But this time, “hitting my head against the typewriter” didn’t work. Or, I should say, it worked for about thirty pages, and after that I went into a state of confusion. I didn’t know what happened or what to do or where to go, and after struggling with the story line for several weeks, I plunged into the infamous writer’s block.

			It was awful. To help me, I started doing a lot of drugs, but instead of finding my story I simply got further and further away from it. I became angry, despondent, and frustrated, then surrendered to a deep depression. It went on for several weeks, until I became frightened, and stopped taking everything. Cold turkey.

			A few days later a friend of mine, then the story editor for a major production company, called and we went out to dinner. During the course of the meal I shared the problem with him and he asked a very simple question: “What’s your story about?”

			I looked at him dumbfounded. In all my despair and pain and depression over my “writing block,” I had forgotten all about my story. It was the first time I had been asked to tell the story, to describe it out loud.

			I stammered awhile, trying to remember what it was about, and finally managed to blurt out the basic idea. He listened, asked some pertinent questions, made some suggestions, and told me he wanted to see something in writing.

			I agreed, and when I returned that night, I sat down and wrote a short treatment. I couldn’t believe what happened—as soon as I knew my story, my writer’s block vanished. That’s when I suddenly understood: “The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write.”

			That experience taught me how important it is to know your story. In all my screenwriting workshops and seminars across the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and South America, I continually stress the fact that you must know your story before you can write anything. And it all starts when you’re able to take the four elements, the ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II, and structure them into a dramatic story line.

			Why a four-page treatment and not ten or twenty pages?

			Because at this stage you really don’t know much about your story. You only have a general idea of an action and character, and a general basis for your plot, as well as the four anchoring points: ending, beginning, Plot Points I and II. That’s all you know about your story at this point. You don’t know what the purpose of a particular scene is or what part it plays in the story line. You probably don’t even know whether it moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. Most of us don’t have the answers to these kinds of questions at this stage. We have to frame in the story line, anchor it in the foundation of narrative.

			The treatment helps set you up for the actual writing of the screenplay. So, when you’re writing this short, four-page treatment, don’t get carried away with excessive detail. Adding in too much detail now does not serve your best interests.

			You’ll always be able to be more specific later on, adding individual characterization, what kind of a car he or she drives, how his or her apartment looks, the paintings on the wall, and why he or she goes by train and not plane. You don’t need to know that right now. Later on, yes.

			That’s why a four-page treatment is a good length at this stage for organizing your story line. It is not your story, it’s just an outline of the story, a start point in the screenwriting process. So put all your expectations, your hopes and dreams away in a drawer somewhere where they’re out of sight, and simply sit down and write the treatment.

			Here’s the assignment: you’re going to write a four-page treatment, a narrative synopsis, of your story line. In the preceding chapters, we talked about isolating the idea and putting it into a subject. Basically, it describes what your story’s about and who it’s about. Then we took the subject and broke it down on the paradigm so we knew the ending, the beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. The paradigm becomes your structural anchor.

			Now take the subject of your story line—the action and character—and lay it out in dramatic structure on the paradigm. Choose your ending first, then determine your beginning, then choose Plot Point I and Plot Point II. Do it the same way you did the structure exercise in the previous chapter.

			As Aristotle says, we begin at the beginning. What’s your opening scene or sequence? We’re going into some brief detail here. Where does it take place? With your character arriving at the airport, like Vincent arriving in Los Angeles in Collateral? Or does it take place on a deserted road, in a car, in the back country? Does your script open in a dream, or flashback, as in The Bourne Supremacy? Or do you open on a crowded city street, or an empty elevator, or in a bedroom with an erotic sex scene like Basic Instinct (Joe Eszterhas)? At this moment you don’t have to be too specific or precise; you don’t have to know everything yet. Just deal with your story line in broad strokes. The details will come later.

			If your opening scene or sequence takes place at the office, what is your character doing? Arriving at work on Monday morning? Leaving on Friday afternoon? Sketch it in, knowing you can change it all later. Remember that the purpose of this exercise is to define and synopsize your story line in four pages. It should either be double-spaced, or a space and a half.

			Not eight pages, not five pages—four pages.

			Once you’ve decided on what your opening scene or sequence is, we’re going to break the treatment down into two distinct categories. The first category I call the dramatic recreation of the scene or sequence. It visually describes the action. For example: “Night. A car slowly weaves though the streets. It turns a corner, pulls over to the side. Stops. The lights go out. The car sits in front of a large house. Waits. Silence. In the distance, a dog BARKS. JOE sits behind the wheel, silently, a radio transmitter on the seat next to him. He slips on a pair of earphones, slowly turns the dial to pick up police calls. Then he listens. And waits.”

			I call that a dramatic recreation because it’s a visually specific description of the action. Remember, we’re setting up the opening scene or sequence here. Describe the action of the opening in about half a page. Use a few lines of dialogue if you need to.

			Remember, this is not your screenplay; it’s only a treatment, a narrative synopsis of your story.

			The second category I call the narrative synopsis, and that’s where you summarize the action in broad, general strokes. If your story is about the relationship between a recently divorced mother and her teenage son who wants to live with his father in another state, you want to summarize what happens during the rest of Act I. If your opening scene or sequence starts with a dream of the mother waking up to an empty house, the rest of Act I deals with setting up and establishing their relationship. For example, “the mother tries to communicate with her son but he continues to disrupt life by performing poorly in school, becoming defiant and disrespectful of his teachers. He criticizes her constantly, complaining of her physical inability to do ‘guy’ things like throwing footballs and lifting weights. It seems clear that the mother feels she’s losing him. She vows to spend more time with him and puts him before her work and her own well-being. But her determination does little to gain his respect or appreciation. The mother doesn’t know what to do anymore or what it will take to win back his affection.”

			The narrative synopsis is a general description, a summary of the action that takes place during the rest of Act I. If you contrast this type of writing with the opening, the dramatic recreation, you’ll see that the opening is specific, whereas the narrative synopsis is general. That’s the tone we want to achieve in this four-page treatment. You want it to look like there’s a full story, but the truth is there are only four points of the story line which are specific. It leads us directly into the next step, a dramatic recreation of Plot Point I.

			What is the incident, episode, or event that is the Plot Point at the end of Act I? Is it an action sequence or a dialogue sequence? Where does it take place? What’s the purpose of the scene or sequence? Remember, a plot point is always a function of character. Does it reveal character or move the story forward?

			Next, in about half a page, in a dramatic recreation, write the Plot Point at the end of Act I. If you’re writing an action film, and your character is setting out on a mission to avenge a wrong, wanting to discover who’s after him and why by traveling to another location, it could be as simple as this: “He sits on motorcycle facing east. Packed for travel. Revving up the carbon. Dropping into gear. The waiting is finally over. It’s time. The warrior is returning to do battle.” Remember, a plot point can be as simple as a change of locale or as complex as an escape from a prison. It’s anything you want it to be.

			Something else to take into account: if your character’s dramatic need changes at Plot Point I, be clear on what the new dramatic need is. In Thelma & Louise, the two women start out for a weekend holiday, but after killing the would-be rapist, their dramatic need changes. Now, they are two women wanted for questioning who are running from the police.

			With just three dramatic elements, the opening, Act I, and Plot Point I, you’re up to a page and a half of a four-page treatment. Not bad for just two scenes or sequences.

			We’ve completed Act I so now you’re ready to move on into Act II. Act II is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately sixty pages long. It begins at the end of Plot Point I and goes to the end of Plot Point II. It is held together with the dramatic context known as Confrontation. If you know your character’s dramatic need—what he or she wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay—you can create obstacles to that need and then your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle (or not overcoming them) to achieve his or her dramatic need.

			Remember, all drama is conflict. Without conflict you have no action. Without action, you have no character. Without character, you have no story, and without story you have no screenplay.

			So think about Act II for a moment. Your character is going to be encountering conflict. Conflict means “in opposition to,” so what does your character encounter? It’s important to note that there are two types of conflict: External conflict, where a force is working against the dramatic need of the characters, like being pursued or pursuing someone, being captured by an enemy, trying to survive during a natural disaster, overcoming a physical injury, and so on. Then there’s internal conflict, such as fear, whether it’s fear of failure, fear of success, or fear of intimacy or commitment. An internal conflict can become an impediment to the character’s action. It is an emotional force within the character that interferes with his or her dramatic need.

			Cold Mountain (Anthony Minghella) is a good example. Inman, the Jude Law character, is wounded during the Civil War and taken to a hospital behind the lines. In flashback and voiceover narration, we see and hear about his relationship with Ada (Nicole Kidman). She wants him to “come back to me,” so Inman deserts the Confederate Army and starts his physical and emotional journey back to Cold Mountain. The community of Cold Mountain is not only a physical town, but also an emotional place in the heart. Inman has to overcome all kinds of obstacles, including weather, enemy soldiers, capture, and being hunted by the Confederate Police to serve his dramatic need: returning to Cold Mountain and Ada. The obstacles he confronts during Act II are both internal and external, and bring drama and tension as he attempts to survive the journey home.

			Ada’s conflict is also both internal and external. She has been raised with the skills and qualities of a “lady”—she can play the piano, be a premiere hostess at church gatherings, read, and be a personable companion. But, she doesn’t know the first thing about surviving on the farm after her father dies. She must deal with the internal frustration of not knowing what she has to do to survive, mending fences or planting crops or just fending for herself.

			Most of the time we encounter both internal and external conflicts. So, as you prepare to describe the action that takes place in Act II, it’s a good idea to sketch out some of the obstacles your character may confront.

			First, take a separate sheet of paper, and list four obstacles your character confronts during Act II. Do you know what they are? Can you define and articulate them? Are they internal obstacles or external? Think about it and when you’re ready, just list them. Ask yourself whether these four obstacles generate a sense of dramatic conflict within the progression of your story. If your story is about a botanist in the Grand Canyon, possible obstacles might include the dangers of running the white-water rapids; succumbing to the tremendous heat; or a physical hardship, such as a severe ankle strain or a broken bone. It could be the raft overturning, losing supplies, or friction between the other characters. Select four conflicts, either internal or external, or some combination of both, but always making sure they are obstacles that confront your character and that move the story forward to the Plot Point at the end of Act II.

			When that’s complete, go back to your treatment. In a narrative synopsis, summarize the action of Act II in a page, using these four conflicts as the anchoring points of the story line. Just follow your character as he or she confronts each obstacle, and then summarize the obstacle in about a quarter of a page. It’s important to generate a dramatic flow to the material at this point. Focus on your character confronting and overcoming these obstacles and simply describe the action—that is, what happens—in broad strokes. As mentioned, you’ll find that if you spend too much time on the specific details of the action, you’ll wind up with something like eight pages, not four. So, keep the material general; at this stage, too much detail is the enemy.

			When you finish, you should have written about two and a half pages, and you’re ready to write the Plot Point at the end of Act II. What is Plot Point II? Can you describe it? Dramatize it? In a dramatic recreation, write Plot Point II in about half a page. If you want, use a few lines of dialogue if necessary. How does the Plot Point at the end of Act II “spin” the action around into Act III? Keep the story flowing smoothly without regard to the specifics of the narrative. Again, your tendency will probably be to add detail, so watch for it and don’t get caught up in it. You’ll know when you’re starting to overthink it because you’ll find yourself spending time trying to decide exactly how it happens, what the character’s specific motivation is, what kind of car he’s driving, or which job or location to use. Just let it go. You don’t need too much character motivation for this exercise.

			This now takes you into Act III, the Resolution. What happens in Act III? Does your character live or die, succeed or fail, win the race or not, get married or not, get divorced or not, kill the bad guy or not? What is the solution of your story? Do you know what has to happen to resolve the story line? What is the solution? Not the specifics, only the generalities. In about half a page, write up the narrative synopsis of what happens in Act III. Describe the resolution simply.

			Now we’re at the ending. You know what the resolution is, so in half a page, write the dramatic recreation of the ending. It could be an action sequence, like a rescue, or an emotional scene, like a wedding. It doesn’t have to be perfect, and feel free to change anything you want to regarding the ending at a later time. The end scene or sequence is only a dramatic choice at this point and can be changed, heightened, or exaggerated during the actual writing process. When you complete the exercise, you’ll have your story line written up and dramatized in four pages:

			To recap:

			In half a page—write a dramatic recreation of the opening scene or sequence;

			In half a page—write a narrative synopsis of the action summarizing what happens during the rest of Act I;

			In half a page—write a dramatic recreation of the Plot Point at the end of Act I;

			Then, on a separate sheet of paper, write four obstacles—either internal or external, or some combination of both—that your character confronts during Act II. Then:

			In a page—write a narrative synopsis, summarizing the action of Act II by focusing on four conflicts that confront your character. It could be as simple as a couple of sentences describing each obstacle. Then, write:

			In half a page—a dramatic recreation of the Plot Point at the end of Act II;

			In half a page—a narrative synopsis of the action in Act III, the Resolution;

			Then, in half a page—write a dramatic recreation of the ending scene or sequence of the screenplay.

			That’s a four-page treatment. It looks like a story, reads like a story, but it’s only a treatment of what your story line is about. It’s something you can register at the Writers Guild of America, West or East, and it is the “proof of authorship.” You can register it online at www.wga.org and click on registration. As of this writing, it costs $20 for a nonmember and $10 for a member. Registering the treatment allows you to claim authorship of your story as of the date it’s registered. It’s not necessary to copyright your material. If you want, you can also send the four-page treatment to yourself, certified, with a return receipt requested, but do not open the envelope when you receive it.

			Writing these four pages is what I call “the kick in the ass” exercise; they may be the toughest pages you’ll write during the entire screenplay. You are taking an unformed and undefined idea, arbitrarily choosing an ending, and structuring it in terms of beginning, middle, and end. It’s tough, because you really don’t have too much material to work with. Your characters are not defined, and there’s no room for specific detail. If you do put in too much detail, you may end up getting lost or confused. It may take two or three times to write up your story line and edit it down to four pages. Your first effort may be eight pages long, which you’ll reduce to five, then finally cut to four.

			You might experience all kinds of internal resistance when writing the treatment; you might get angry or bored, and the chances are that you’ll probably make a lot of judgments and evaluations about what you’re writing. Your critical voice may tell you “this is the most boring story in the world!” Or “I hate it! It’s simple and stupid.” Or “I’ve heard it all before.” Or “Why did I think I could write this?”

			You may be right. At this stage, the chances are that your story may actually be boring.

			So what? It’s only a four-page treatment. It’s only a first words-on-paper exercise, nothing more. You can’t lose sight of the fact that you’re just writing four pages. It is what it is. These pages are not going to be carved in stone or written in gold. Just write the treatment. It’s okay that it’s not perfect.

			Bear in mind that this four-page treatment may have little or nothing to do with the way your final screenplay turns out. It’s only a start point, not the finished product. Your story is going to change and evolve and grow during the writing experience, so don’t expect these pages to be flawless. Forget your expectations. You don’t need to make too many critical evaluations. Save them for later! Writing is experiential—the more you do, the easier it gets.

			One last note of caution: when you complete the treatment, the chances are that you’ll be uncertain about whether it works, or whether it’s good or bad. Your tendency may be to get feedback, some kind of affirmation about what you’re writing.

			Don’t.

			Don’t let your wife, husband, lover, girlfriend, boyfriend, brother, or sister read it. They’ll want to, I’m sure. They may even beg and plead to read your four pages. Don’t let them. And here’s why: I’ve had many students show these pages to the significant people in their lives looking for feedback and affirmation. One woman, in particular, was insecure and showed her treatment to her husband, who happened to be in the movie business. Out of his love for her, out of his concern to “really be honest” with her, and because he cared so much, he told her what he truly thought about it. His “truth” was that the material was dull, the characters weren’t fleshed out, plus as an afterthought he mentioned that there might have been a similar film made several years earlier. Needless to say, she was devastated. Not only did she put the treatment in a drawer and bury it, but what’s worse, she never went back to writing again. She had a wonderful sense of comic potential but she chose to listen to her husband because she thought he knew more than she did, and she never recovered.

			I’ve seen this happen over and over again. It’s why you have to understand that this is only a four-page treatment. It’s not your screenplay. It’s only a starting point exercise, not an end point.

			Don’t write these four pages thinking you can sell it, either. This is an exercise to clarify your story in your own mind. Just do the exercise and tell the story. Don’t get caught up trying to sell the treatment or thinking about how much money you’re going to make when the movie is made.

			Focus on getting your story line down to four pages and don’t worry about what happens after it’s written.

			The way the ancient Sanskrit text, the Bhagavad Gita, puts it: “Don’t be attached to the fruits of your actions.”

			What Makes Good Character?


			 				 					Wolf: “Just because you are a character doesn’t mean you have character.”

				 					 						—Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary

						Pulp Fiction





			Many years ago, while traveling with some friends in Italy, I went to visit the little town of Assisi, the home of St. Francis of Assisi. We took a bus up the long and winding road to the little church and monastery high on the hill where St. Francis lived, worked and studied. I didn’t know too much about him; I knew he started the Holy Order of the Franciscans and I knew he wrote sublime poetry, essays, and philosophy. The paintings and images I had seen had always showed him being surrounded by birds and other animals. It was said that he could talk to the animals, and his poetry and writings are filled with the harmony and union of nature and that all life is connected by divine consciousness. All living things are related, he said, the birds, the trees, the rocks, the rivers, the streams and oceans, we are all manifestations of the one consciousness, and as living beings we express the life force that flows through us. Call it God, or Nature, or whatever you want, it doesn’t matter. It is what it is.

			As we toured the tiny, sparse rooms of the church and monastery and climbed the steep paths that wandered along the wooded hills, walking through shadows and sunlight, I noticed the birds were everywhere, chirping and singing in a cacophony of sound. I stood observing this symphony of sound and movement, thought about walking on the same path as St. Francis, and I became aware that my breathing had become calm and even, my mind still, and I felt like I was in a meditative state. I looked around the beautiful landscape and wondered whether I was experiencing this feeling because of the harmony of the landscape, or whether the land and trees and birds had absorbed St. Francis’ state and I was just immersed in the energy or vibration of the place itself. I wondered whether this divine state, mind calm but senses totally alert, was the same state that St. Francis referred to in his poetry and writings.

			I speculated as to whether we, as human beings, have this same potential to transcend our ordinary reality and enter this state of transcendence. It was like I had merged into the environment. I don’t know how long I stood on that footpath, absorbed in this energy. It could have been a few minutes or an hour. When I looked around, I saw a large number of birds resting on tree limbs nearby, and I knew deep down inside, they were watching me, like they were tuning into my thought waves. It was an extraordinary experience.

			I roused myself and started down the path leading to the monastery. As I made my way down the hill, I found myself wondering what kind of a person St. Francis was. Was he such a radiant and powerful being that he could transcend his identity as a man and merge into this living energy, or vibration, to became one with the spirit of the birds and animals of Assisi? What kind of a person was he that he could rise above his human limitations and become one with this divine energy? In other words, what qualities did St. Francis possess that made him so unique as a person?

			And that brought up the question of character. It was a question I’ve asked myself many times, both as a teacher and a student, when writing and teaching about the qualities of character.

			What makes good character?

			Is it the character’s purpose or motivation? Is it the dialogue that he or she speaks? Is it what the character wants to achieve during the course of the screenplay? Is it his insights or cleverness or credibility or believability? His integrity? Is it the action he goes through to achieve his dramatic purpose? What qualities must a character possess to keep us interested in him or her as he or she moves through the landscape of the screenplay?

			Philosophers talk about a man’s life as being measured by the sum total of his actions; our lives are “measured” by what we accomplish, or do not accomplish, in our lifetime. “Life consists in action,” Aristotle said, “and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.”

			What is character?

			Action is character—a person is defined by what he does, not what he says.

			In a screenplay, either the character drives the action, or the action drives the character. For example, in The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne sets out on a personal journey to avenge the death of his girlfriend Marie, and to find out who is after him and why. It could be a story of revenge, but instead becomes a story of discovery and redemption. In this case, the character drives the action. He learns that his fingerprints were found in Berlin where two CIA agents were killed, while he was several thousand miles away, in Goa, India. Who is after him? And why? Midway through the film, he discovers that he was responsible for killing a Russian politician and his wife several years earlier. Now he must accept the responsibility for his actions and find the daughter of the two people he killed. It is his actions that determine his character.

			In Batman Begins (Chris Nolan and David Goyer), the action drives the character. Bruce Wayne sets out to avenge the murder of his father and mother. But first, he must overcome his fear of bats. If anything, Batman Begins is a story of the caped crusader overcoming his own fears to bring justice and order to Gotham City. These two elements become the narrative thrusts that drive the story forward to its dynamic resolution.

			In the classic film The Hustler, written by Sidney Carroll and Robert Rossen, from the book by Walter Tevis, Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a smooth-talking, fast-shooting pool player from Oakland. Fast Eddie comes to town to take on the “king of straight pool,” Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). Though Fast Eddie may be a better pool player, his attitude and his action make him, in Bert Gordon’s (George C. Scott) terms, “a loser.” During the story, Fast Eddie goes from being a loser to being a winner. That is his action, his character arc.

			Good characters are the heart and soul and nervous system of your screenplay. The story is told through your characters and this engages the audience to experience the universal emotions that transcend our ordinary reality. The purpose of creating good characters is to capture our unique sense of humanness, to touch, move, and inspire the audience.

			“When you create characters,” the great English playwright and screenwriter, Harold Pinter says, “they observe you, their writer, warily. It may sound absurd but I’ve suffered two kinds of pain from my characters. I have witnessed their pain when I’m in the act of distorting or falsifying them, and I’ve suffered pain when I’ve been unable to get to the quick of them, when they willfully elude me, when they withdraw into the shadows.

			“There’s no question a conflict takes place between the writer and his characters. On the whole I would say the characters are the winners, and that is as it should be. When a writer sets out a blueprint for his characters and keeps them rigidly to it, where they do not at any time upset his applecart, when he has mastered them he has also killed or rather terminated their births.”

			F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in one of his journals that “when you begin with an individual, you create a type.” His first novel, This Side of Paradise, written when he was twenty-two or twenty-three, portrayed a dazzling heroine modeled after his wife Zelda. The book quickly became a best-seller, and it wasn’t long before the “type” created by Fitzgerald was celebrated in the movies, in the likes of Clara Bow, who would soon become known as the “It” girl. Women all over the country imitated her, dressed like her, styled their hair like hers, and acted and talked like her. She typified “the flapper,” truly a phenomenon of the twenties.

			The flapper is really a type. In the same way, James Dean was a type because he inspired others to look and act like him. The flower child of the sixties was a type, as were The Beatles and Bob Dylan. These performers influenced an entire generation. Long hair became the fashion, antiwar demonstrations became commonplace, and hippies were everywhere. Madonna is a type because she inspires a new way of thinking and dressing. Michael Jordan is a type—not only was he a great and celebrated basketball player, but an athlete who shaved his head and influenced others to do the same for more than a decade.

			Creating good characters is essential to the success of your screenplay. That means you want to create “a type.” As mentioned earlier, all drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action; without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story; and without story, you have no screenplay.

			When you set out to create your characters, you must know them inside and out; you need to know their hopes and dreams and fears, their likes and dislikes, their background and mannerisms. In other words, they have to have a personal history.

			Creating a character is part of the mystery of the creative process. It is an ongoing, never-ending practice. In order to really solve the problem of character, it’s essential to build the foundations and fabric of his or her life, then add ingredients that will heighten and expand his or her individual portrait.

			What makes good characters? Is it their purpose? Their motivation? The way they overcome, or fail to overcome, the conflict they must deal with? Is it their dialogue? Ask yourself what qualities your characters exemplify during the course of the screenplay. In order to create a character we must first establish the context of character, the qualities of behavior, that makes him or her unique, someone we can root for and identify with. Once we establish this, we can add his or her characterization, coloring and shading the various traits and mannerisms of his or her character.

			Action is character. It’s important to note that your character must be an active force in your screenplay, not a passive one. So many times, I read screenplays where the character only reacts to incidents, episodes, or events. He or she doesn’t cause anything to happen; things merely happen to the character. If your main character is too passive, then he or she often disappears off the page and a minor character will leap forward to draw attention away from the main character.

			I’ve read and evaluated thousands upon thousands of screenplays during the course of my career. And in all that reading and analyzing, I have come to understand there are four things that go into the making of a good character: one, the character has a strong and defined dramatic need; two, he or she has an individual point of view; three, the character personifies an attitude, and four, the character often goes through some kind of change, or transformation.

			These four elements, these four essential qualities, are the anchors for what makes good characters in a screenplay. Every major character has a strong dramatic need. Dramatic need is defined as what your main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay. The dramatic need is his purpose, his mission, his motivation, the force that drives him through the narrative action of the story line.

			In most cases, you can express the dramatic need in a sentence or two. It’s usually simple and can be stated in a line of dialogue or through the character’s actions. Regardless of how you express it, you, as writer, must know your character’s dramatic need. If you don’t know it, who does?

			In Cinderella Man (Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman), James Braddock’s dramatic need is to provide for his family. How he does this is what the movie is about. As he is rocked and socked by the Depression, his dramatic need stabilizes him and becomes the driving force keeping him going so he does not give up. Ironically, the injury he suffers to his left wrist before the Depression becomes the tool he uses to strengthen his left hand. Working as a dock worker, he lifts cargo with his left hand and when he is given a second chance to fight, his dramatic need provides him with the courage and will to win the Heavyweight Championship of the World against Max Baer.

			In Thelma & Louise, the characters’ dramatic need is to escape safely to Mexico; that’s what drives these two characters through the story line. In Cold Mountain, Inman’s dramatic need is to return home to his love Ada, and Ada’s dramatic need is to survive and adapt to the conditions around her. In The Lord of the Rings, Frodo’s dramatic need is to carry the ring to Mount Doom and destroy it in the fires that created it.

			There are times when the dramatic need of your character changes during the course of the screenplay. If your character’s dramatic need does change, it usually occurs at Plot Point I, the true beginning of your story. In American Beauty (Alan Ball), Lester’s (Kevin Spacey) dramatic need is to regain his life. When the story begins he feels like a dead man and it takes meeting Angela (Mena Suvari), the young friend of his daughter, to bring him back to life. The rest of the film deals with Lester learning to live again, in joy, freedom, and full self-expression.

			The dramatic need is the engine that powers your character through the story line. What is your character’s dramatic need? Can you define it in a few words? State it simply and clearly? Knowing your character’s dramatic need is essential. In a conversation with Waldo Salt, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of Midnight Cowboy and Coming Home, he told me when he creates a character, he starts with the character’s dramatic need; it becomes the force that drives the story’s structure.

			The key to a successful screenplay, Salt emphasized, was preparing the material. If you know your character’s dramatic need, he said, dialogue becomes “perishable,” because the actor can always improvise lines to make it work. But, he added forcefully, the character’s dramatic need is sacrosanct. That cannot be changed because it holds the entire story in place. Putting words down on paper, he said, was the easiest part of the screenwriting process; it was the visual conception of the story that took so long. And he quoted Picasso: “Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.”

			The second thing that makes a good character is point of view. Point of view is defined as “the way a person sees, or views, the world.” Every person has an individual point of view. Point of view is a belief system, and as we know, what we believe to be true, is true for us. There’s an ancient Hindu scripture titled the Yoga Vasistha, which states that “the World is as you see it.” That means that what’s inside our heads—our thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories—are reflected outside, in our everyday experience. It is our minds, how we see the world, that determines our experience. “You are the baker of the bread you eat,” is the way one Great Being puts it.

			Point of view shades and colors the way we see the world. Have you ever heard or reacted to phrases like: “Life is unfair,” “You can’t fight City Hall,” “All life is a game of chance,” “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” “You make your own luck,” or “Success is based on who you know”? These are all points of view. Since a point of view is a belief system, we act and react as if they are true. That’s why every person has a definite and distinct point of view, singular and unique. For it is our experience that determines our point of view.

			Is your character an environmentalist? A humanist? A racist? Someone who believes in fate, destiny, and astrology? Or does your character believe in voodoo, witchcraft, or that the future can be revealed through a medium or psychic? Does your character believe that the limitations we confront are self-imposed, like Neo in The Matrix? Does your character put his faith in doctors, lawyers, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times? Is your character a believer in popular culture, an advocate of Time, People, Newsweek, CNN, and the network evening news?

			Point of view is an individual and independent belief system. “I believe in God” is a point of view. So is “I don’t believe in God.” Or, “I don’t know whether there is a God or not.” These are three separate and distinct points of view. Each is true within the individual’s fabric of experience. What’s important to note here is that there is no right or wrong here, no good or bad, no judgment, justification, or evaluation. Point of view is as singular and distinctive as a rose on a rose bush. No two leaves, no two flowers, no two people are ever the same.

			Your character’s point of view may be that the indiscriminate slaughtering of dolphins and whales is morally wrong because they are two of the most intelligent species on the planet, maybe smarter than man. Your character supports that point of view by participating in demonstrations and wearing T-shirts with Save the whales and dolphins on them. That’s an aspect of characterization.

			Everyone has an individual point of view. A friend of mine is a vegetarian; that expresses her point of view. Another friend marches against the war in the Middle East, and she spends time and money supporting the cause. That expresses a point of view. Imagine a confrontation between pro-choice and pro-life supporters. Two opposing points of view generate conflict.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, there’s a short scene between Andy and Red that reveals the differences in their points of view. After almost twenty years in Shawshank Prison, Red is cynical because, in his eyes, hope is simply a four-letter word. His spirit has been so crushed by the prison system that he angrily declares to Andy, “Hope is a dangerous thing. Drives a man insane. It’s got no place here. Better get used to the idea.” But Red’s emotional journey leads him to the understanding that “hope is a good thing.” The film ends on a note of hope, with Red breaking his parole and riding the bus to meet Andy in Mexico: “I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams…I hope.”

			Andy has a different point of view; he believes that “there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there’s a small place inside of us they can never lock away. Hope.” That’s what keeps Andy going in prison, that’s what makes him sacrifice one week of his life in solitary, “the hole,” just so he can listen once again to an aria from a Mozart opera. Hope is a forceful dynamic in Andy Dufresne’s character.

			The third thing that makes good character is attitude. Attitude is defined as a “manner or opinion,” and reflects a person’s personal opinion determined by an intellectual decision. An attitude, differentiated from a point of view, is determined by a personal judgment—this is right, this is wrong, this is good, this is bad, this is positive or negative, angry or happy, cynical or naive, superior or inferior, liberal or conservative, optimistic or pessimistic.

			Attitude encompasses a person’s behavior. Do you know someone who is “always right,” about everything? That’s an attitude. Being socially or morally superior is also an attitude; so is being “macho.” A political opinion expresses an attitude, as does complaining about what is wrong with the world. In professional sports, trash-talking has become a way of life. That’s an attitude, as are most of the lyrics in rap music.

			By the same token, have you wanted to buy something and found yourself dealing with a salesperson who does not want to be there, has negative energy, and thinks he or she is superior to you? That’s attitude. Have you ever attended a function and been overdressed or underdressed, literally not wearing the “right” clothes? And some people may invariably give the impression that they are morally superior to you. That sense of righteous behavior mirrors a person’s attitude. They are convinced they’re right and you’re wrong. Judgments, opinions, and evaluations all stem from attitude. It’s an intellectual decision they make. “I would never belong to a club that would have someone like me as a member,” is the way Alvy Singer puts it in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall.

			Understanding your character’s attitude allows you to show who she or he is by their actions and dialogue. Is he or she enthusiastic or unhappy about his or her life and job? People express different parts of themselves through their attitude—someone, for example, who feels the world owes them a living, or attributes their lack of success to “who you know.”

			Sometimes, you can build a whole scene around a person’s attitude. Collateral is a case in point. At Plot Point II, the first time Max really stands up to Vincent, most of the scene is driven by the attitudes of the two characters. Angry and upset, Max asks Vincent why “you didn’t kill me and find another cab?” Vincent replies that the two of them are connected. “You know, fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence. All that crap.” Max says, “You’re full of shit.” Vincent, somewhat defensive, wants to justify that “all I’m doing is taking out the garbage. Killing bad people.”

			The whole exchange is one of attitude. Both characters are expressing their opinions by defending their actions. Max asks Vincent why he kills people and Vincent tells him that there is “no why…There is no good reason. No bad reason. To live or to die.” Vincent says he’s totally “indifferent” to the lives he takes. “C’mon, man. Get with it. Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one. In a blink…that’s us. Lost in space. The universe don’t care about you. The cop, you, me? Who notices?” Max looks at him, aghast, suddenly understanding that there will be no end to this nightmare until Max stands up for himself and takes the action that may save his life.

			The exchange also reveals character, as Vincent probes and bursts Max’s dream balloon. Up until now, Vincent says, Max has lived in a dream, in a “someday” state: someday he’s going to fulfill his dream of starting his own limousine company, someday he’s going to meet the woman of his dreams, someday he’ll have it all and be fulfilled as a person. It’s a pretty big “someday.” Vincent points out that there is only now, only today, this present moment, this point in time. “Someday” has become only an excuse for not going after what he truly wants.

			In Annie Hall, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) presents his attitude in the opening lines when he expresses “how I feel about life. A lot of suffering, pain, anxiety and problems—and it’s all over much too quickly. That’s the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.” That’s what the movie is about: his relationships with women. The film illustrates his attitude.

			Sometimes it’s difficult to separate point of view from attitude. Many of my students struggle to define these two qualities, but I tell them it really doesn’t matter. When you’re creating the basic core of your character, you’re taking one large ball of wax, the character, and pulling it apart into four separate pieces. The parts and the whole, right? Who cares whether one part is point of view and another is attitude? It doesn’t make any difference; the parts and the whole are really the same thing. So if you’re unsure about whether a particular character trait is a point of view or an attitude, don’t worry about it. Just separate the concepts in your own mind.

			The fourth quality that makes up good character is change or transformation. Does your character change during the course of your screenplay? If so, what is the change? Can you define it? Articulate it? Can you trace the emotional arc of the character from the beginning to the end? In The Truth About Cats & Dogs (Audrey Wells), both characters undergo a change that brings about a new awareness of who they are. Abby’s final acceptance that she is really loved for who she is completes the character arc of the change.

			From the beginning of Collateral, Max has been portrayed as being weak, a wimp, a man afraid to stand up to the cab dispatcher, a man who lives his “someday” dream pictured in the postcard. In short, this scene, set amid the fury and confusion of the speeding cab, allows us to watch Max’s internal transformation from weakness to strength and ultimately leads to the film’s conclusion. Max has completed his character arc.

			Having a character change during the course of the screenplay is not a requirement if it doesn’t fit your character. But transformation, change, seems to be universal—especially at this time in our culture. I think we’re all a little like the Melvin character (Jack Nicholson) in As Good As It Gets (Mark Andrus and James L. Brooks). Melvin may be complex and fastidious as a person, but his dramatic need is expressed at the very end when he says, “When I’m with you I want to be a better person.” I think we all want that. Change, transformation, is a constant in our lives and if you can impel some kind of emotional change within your character, it creates an arc of behavior and adds another dimension to who he or she is. If you’re unclear about the character’s change, take the time to write an essay in a page or so, charting his or her emotional arc.

			In The Hustler, Fast Eddie’s dramatic need is to beat Minnesota Fats and win ten thousand dollars in one night. And the entire screenplay is woven around this dramatic action. When Fast Eddie plays Minnesota Fats the first time around, he loses. Pride, overconfidence, and a “losing” attitude—he drinks too much during the game—bring about his defeat. He is forced to accept the fact that he is, indeed, a loser. When he realizes this, he signs with Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) because “twenty-five percent of something is better than a hundred percent of nothing.” His realization and acceptance of who he is enables him to become a winner. Fast Eddie challenges Minnesota Fats and this time defeats him easily. His character arc goes from being a loser to being a winner. That is his change, his transformation.

			Seabiscuit (Gary Ross) is another good example of change. Based on a true story, we see who the characters are and what they want to become. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) comes to San Francisco, with a few dollars in his pocket, to create his fortune. He is a man who believes in the future. But then his young son is killed in an auto accident, his wife leaves him, and Howard sinks into deep depression. He meets a young woman, marries her, and acquires an interest in horses and horse racing. But deep down, he continues to mourn for the loss of his son.

			Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is raised in an affluent middle-class home, filled with books and intellectual discussions. But Red has a gift for riding horses. When the Depression strikes, his family is forced out of their house and into the basic struggle for survival. At about the age of fifteen, Red enters some horse races and is successful—so successful, in fact, that his father gives him away to the owner of a racing stable because he cannot provide for his son. Red feels worthless, unwanted, and his sense of self-destructive behavior soon becomes evident as he ekes out a living on the racing circuit.

			Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) also has an uncanny gift of communicating with animals. The one thing that drives his life is his pursuit of freedom. In a marvelous little scene at the beginning of the film, Tom Smith is riding his horse on the open plains when he reaches a spot which is blocked by barbed wire. As he examines the fence, we hear Charles Howard talking about the future in voiceover.

			Setting up these three characters is an illustration of showing what they have lost in their lives: Howard has lost his son; Pollard, his family; and Tom Smith his freedom. In addition, if you contemplate the life of the horse, Seabiscuit, he’s taken away from his mother at six months, trained, punished, and ridiculed by various horse trainers. Soon, he becomes an outlaw, a defiant animal who has “forgotten what’s it’s like to be a horse,” as Smith observes.

			These four characters are joined together in a journey, and through their efforts and teamwork, they form a rallying cry for an entire country. Howard looks upon his team as family; Red looks up to him as a father figure. Tom Smith sleeps outside under the stars. And it’s through the heroic antics of Seabiscuit that they are all joined together. As Red Pollard observes in the last scene of the movie: “You know, everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him, but we didn’t….He fixed us. Every one of us. And, I guess in a way, we kind of fixed each other, too.”

			All four characters—Howard, Pollard, Smith, and Seabiscuit—have gone through a change, a transformation, and in the process, they have engaged our sensibilities in a way that touches, moves, and inspires us.

			Ordinary People, written by Alvin Sargent from the novel by Judith Guest, shows Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) undergoing a major change. In the beginning of the film, he is closed off and emotionally damaged by his brother’s death and his parents’ withdrawal. By the end, he’s able to open up and express himself, he’s able to understand the emotional dynamics of his brother’s death and let go of his painful burden of guilt, he is able to reach out and ask for help from both his father and his psychiatrist, and he finds a girl he can confide in and be comfortable with.

			His father, played by Donald Sutherland, also undergoes change. He begins as conventional and complacent, but he learns to listen to his son, becomes tolerant and understanding, and soon questions himself, his attitudes, and his marriage. He even seeks help from his son’s psychiatrist, played by Judd Hirsch. In short, he learns to question his own values, needs, and wants.

			The only major character who does not change is Conrad’s mother, played by Mary Tyler Moore. Described in the opening stage directions as being “graceful and controlled,” she is like her refrigerator: “well stocked, and perfectly organized, with nothing out of place.” She is the kind of person who believes that appearance is everything. Her house is immaculate, the closets are clean, and I’ll bet anything that if you open any drawer in the entire house everything is laid out meticulously. That’s the kind of person she is. She always seems to be firmly in control, unbending in attitudes and beliefs, convinced she is right. By the end of the film, father and son have changed but she has not, and the family splinters. In the last scene, father and son are sitting on the porch after the mother has left. Her leaving brings father and son closer together.

			See if you can have your character go through some kind of change, either emotional or physical, as it will broaden and deepen the character in terms of a universal recognition that transcends language, color, culture, or geographic location.

			If you know and can define these four elements of character—dramatic need, point of view, change, and attitude—you’ll have the tools to create good characters. Sometimes they will overlap, like an attitude emerging as a point of view, or the dramatic need will bring about change, and change will affect your character’s attitude. If that happens, don’t worry about it. Sometimes it’s necessary to take something apart in order to put it back together.


				THE EXERCISE

				 					Determine your main character. What is his or her dramatic need? What does your character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay? What is the emotional or physical force that drives your character through the screenplay from beginning to end? Define it, articulate it. Write it down in a sentence or two. Define it clearly and succinctly.

				Do the same with your character’s point of view. How does your character see the world? Through rose-colored glasses, like a dreamer or idealist, like the opening scene of Wes Anderson’s brilliant Rushmore? Or, through jaded and cynical eyes, like Lester Burnham in American Beauty? Remember, it’s a belief system. Know your character’s point of view. Write it down. Define it.

				Do the same with your character’s attitude. What is your character’s manner or opinion? Write it down. Define it.

				What about change? Does your character go through any change during the screenplay? What is it? Write it down. Define it.

				You should be able to define these four qualities in a few sentences. The thinking time is more relevant here than the writing time. As I’ve said before, the hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. Think about the qualities that go into making a good character and see how they apply to your characters.

			The Tools of Character


			 				Narrator: “Royal Tenenbaum bought the house on Archer Avenue in the winter of his thirty-fifth year. Over the next decade, he and his wife had three children, and then they separated.”

				 					 						—Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson

						The Royal Tenenbaums





			As mentioned in Chapter 1, the action of a novel takes place within the mindscape of dramatic action, a play’s action unfolds through dialogue, and a screenplay is a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description and placed within the context of dramatic structure. Three different forms, three different ways of approaching a story line.

			Film is behavior. We know a lot about characters by how they act, or react, in certain situations. Pictures, or images, can reveal different aspects of the character. In Thelma & Louise, for example, the two women approach packing their suitcases differently: Thelma stands in front of her closet, unsure, so she takes everything. Louise, on the other hand, takes a pair of shoes, wrapped in plastic, two sweaters, two bras, three pairs of underwear, two pairs of socks, then, as an afterthought, throws in another pair of socks just to be on the safe side. Then she washes and dries the single glass that is on the sink, puts it away, and walks out the door. What do their actions reveal about their characters? Thelma could be called ditzy or an airhead, whereas Louise seems focused and organized. Film is behavior.

			Seabiscuit is another example of this. Tom Smith is looking for a rider for Seabiscuit and he watches as four grooms try to wrestle the defiant horse to a standstill while a jockey attempts to mount him. The horse fights back in a terrific struggle. Unable to mount the animal, the jockey stomps off, muttering angrily to himself. Smith shakes his head and starts walking away when he sees Red Pollard engaged in a fistfight with four stable hands. The jockey boldly challenges the other men and continues to fight back. Smith looks at Red fighting, then at Seabiscuit fighting; back and forth he watches and we can see his mind working. He sees what we see: Seabiscuit and Red are kindred spirits. No dialogue, no explanation. The next thing we know, Red is the horse’s jockey.

			Character reveals the deep-seated nature of who a person is, in terms of his values, actions, and beliefs. Characters illuminate themselves by their actions, reactions, and by the creative choices they make. Characterization, on the other hand, is expressed in the details of their lives, the way they live, the car they drive, the pictures they hang on the wall, their likes and dislikes, what they eat, and other forms of character expression. Characterization expresses an individual’s taste and how he presents himself to the world.

			Creating character is a process that will be with you from the beginning to the end, from fade in to fade out. It is an ongoing educational progression, an experience that continues expanding as you go deeper and deeper into your characters’ lives.

			There are many ways to approach writing character. Some writers mull over their characters for a long period of time and then, when they feel they “know” them, jump in and start writing. Others create an elaborate list of characterizations. Some writers list the major elements of their character’s life on 3 × 5 cards. Some write extensive outlines or draw diagrams of behavior. Some use pictures from magazines and newspapers to help them see what their characters look like. “That’s my character,” they say. They may tack the pictures above their work area so they can “be with” their characters during their work time. Some use well-known actors and actresses as models for characters.

			Anything that makes it easier for you to create your character is a good tool. Choose your own way. You can use some, all, or none of the tools mentioned here. If it works, use it; if it doesn’t, don’t. Find your own way, your own style in creating character. The important thing is that it’s got to work for you.

			One of the most insightful character tools is writing a character biography. The character biography is a free-association, automatic-writing exercise that reveals your character’s history from birth up until the time your story begins. It captures and defines the forces, both physical and emotional, internal and external, working on your character during those formative years that fashion his or her behavior. It is a process that reveals character.

			Start at the beginning. Is your character male or female? How old is he or she when the story begins? Where does he live? What city or country? Where was he born? Was he an only child, or did he have any brothers and sisters? What kind of relationship did he have with his brothers and sisters? Was it good, bad, confiding, adventurous? What kind of childhood would you say your character had? Would you consider it happy? Or sad? Was it physically or medically challenging, with illness or physical problems? What about his relationship to his parents? Was it good or bad? Was he a mischievous child getting into a lot of trouble or was he quiet and withdrawn, preferring his own inner life instead of a social one? Was he stubborn and willful, and did he have a problem with authority? Do you think he was socially active, made friends easily, and got along well with relatives and other children? What kind of a child would you say he was? Good or bad? Was he outgoing and extroverted or a shy and studious introvert? Let your imagination guide you.

			When you begin formulating your character from birth, you see your character grow and expand in body, shape, and form. This is a process, remember, that forms character.

			What do her parents do for a living? Are they poor, middle class, or upper-middle class? Were her parents divorced? Was your character raised by a single parent, either mother or father? Did that impact her? Were her parents abusive, either physically or verbally? What about the grandparents? Aunts and uncles? Was your character streetwise or sheltered? Did her parents work full-time? If so, how did that impact your character? Was it difficult for her parent(s) to make financial ends meet? What kind of sacrifices did they have to make?

			Most of the time, I’ll break my character biography down into the first ten years of my character’s life, the second ten years, the third ten years, and beyond, if need be. You’ll want to explore these first ten years thoroughly because that’s when behavioral patterns are formed. Imagine their pre-school years, then follow them into their lives in grade school. See if you can sketch in relationships with friends, family, and teachers.

			Consider the second ten years of your character’s life, ages ten to twenty. That means middle school and high school. What kind of influences did your character have while growing up? Who were his or her friends? What kind of interests did he or she have? Did your character take an interest in extra-curricular events, like debating or history clubs? Did he or she participate in after-school athletics, social or political activities? What about sexual experiences? Who was his or her first love? What about relationships with other students? Did your character work part-time during high school? What about sibling relationships? Any envy or hostility present, and did this manifest in your character’s behavior in some way? What kind of relationship did your character have with his or her parents during these years?

			What was his or her high school like? What about his or her relationships with teachers? Did your character have a mentor, and if so, who was it? And what was the benefit of their guidance? Did any major traumatic events happen that may have emotionally impacted your character? Did he or she feel like an outsider? Take a look at Mean Girls (Tina Fey). The whole film is built around this situation. You want as much information as you can get about your character as he or she is growing up.

			Go into the third ten years of your character’s life. Did he or she go to college? If so, which one? What did he or she major in? What were his or her dreams, hopes, and aspirations? Was he or she a good student or did he or she party all the time? What was his or her grade point average? Did his or her focus or interest change during the years at the university? What about love affairs? Many or just a few? Did he or she become active in the political scene on campus? Did he or she work full- or part-time during his or her time in college?

			What happened after he or she graduated? Did he or she find a job easily? Did he or she marry and settle down? Did he or she feel lost and confused about his/her direction in life? This is a good period of their life to focus on as individual dreams often collide with reality; sometimes you can build an entire story around this premise. Keep exploring your character’s life up until the time the story begins.

			How powerful can the character biography be? It is a tremendous tool, revealing deep and profound insights about the main character, and is a marvelous source for generating conflict.

			While the character biography is a tool only for you, there are times when you might want to incorporate some, part, or all of the biographical material in your screenplay. In The Royal Tenenbaums, the first few pages of the screenplay set up the characters as the narrator tells us the family history in what I term a novelistic approach to screenwriting: “Royal Tenenbaum bought the house on Archer Avenue in the winter of his thirty-fifth year,” the narrator begins. “Over the next decade, he and his wife had three children, and then they separated….” As the narrator gives us this information, we see the three children growing up. It sets the tone for the entire film, establishing the familiar Anderson themes of family, failure, and forgiveness.

			In Annie Hall, Woody Allen shows us Alvy Singer’s character biography in the first ten pages of screenplay. “I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess. I was brought up in Brooklyn during World War II.” And then we see his early years growing up and how it impacted him in his relationship with women. “My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood memories, but I swear I was brought up underneath the roller coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, I think.”

			A character is the sum total of his or her experience. Actors and actresses also use the character biography to build and form character. One of my students, an actress, auditioned for a Martin Scorsese film. To prepare for her audition, she approached her part by doing a character biography, then structured the audition scene that she was given into an emotional beginning, middle, and end. When she auditioned, Scorsese liked her and commented on how good her preparation was. He called her back three times after that, twice to audition with Robert De Niro. They both liked her, even if she didn’t get the part. They decided to go with a “different look.” That’s show biz. But it was her preparation that got her that far.

			You need to do the same kind of preparation so you can really know your character. How long should it be? I tell my students that a character biography, written in free-association, should be about five to seven pages, or longer. That’s just a rule of thumb. I also tell them that when I write a character biography, I’ll sometimes write about twenty-five pages. I’ll begin with my character’s grandparents, on both sides, then progress to my character’s parents, on both sides, and then do my character’s life from birth up until the story begins. I might even do past-life biographies, ending with the character’s astrological chart. I’ll write as many pages as I can in free-association. It doesn’t matter how many pages I write—whether it’s fifteen or twenty pages, I’ll do whatever I need to do to know my character.

			If you’re having trouble getting inside your character, try writing the character biography in the first person. For example: “My name is David Hollister. I was born in Boston on the fifth of July. My father was a maritime attorney and always seemed to be angry. I wasn’t sure why, but I always thought I had something to do with it. He wanted me to be a professional person, but I was more interested in music.”

			What’s so great about the character biography is that when you’ve finished, you have a feeling that you really know your character. When you’ve finished the biography, you can take the pages you’ve written and put them in a drawer somewhere. You’ve gotten all those random, dissociated thoughts, feelings, and emotions out of your head and onto the paper. When you face the blank sheet of paper, your character work will help you find the voice of your character.

			Since the character biography delves into your character’s life from birth up until the time the story begins, what about your character’s life during the time the screenplay takes place, from fade in to fade out? This is where we define the professional, personal, and private aspects of your character.

			First, your character’s professional life: What does your main character do for a living? What is his or her relationship with his boss or supervisor? Good? Bad? Feeling neglected? Taken advantage of? Underpaid? How long has your character worked at his or her present job? What is your character’s relationship with his or her associates? Does he or she socialize with them? Where and when did he or she begin his or her career? In the mailroom? At an executive training program? Was he or she hired right from college?

			Is there something going on between the supervisor and your character that causes an emotional tension? Perhaps the loss of a client? In American Beauty, Lester has been with his employer for some fourteen years, and when the story begins, the company has hired an efficiency expert to evaluate the business. And Lester doesn’t like it. His wife, Carolyn, is a realtor and though we only see that in a couple of scenes, how rich it makes her character.

			It’s important to know these facts about your character. In The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne is a victim of amnesia, and must overcome all kinds of obstacles to find out who he is and what his past history is. Write a two- or three-page free-association essay tracing your character’s professional life. Describe and explore your character’s life, focusing on his or her relationships in the workplace, whatever they might be.

			Once you’ve established and defined your character’s professional life, delve into your character’s personal life. Is your character single, married, widowed, divorced, or separated when the story begins? Maybe your character has just separated from a partner before the story begins. Or, perhaps the relationship is rocky and will splinter soon. Suppose your character is married; how long has he or she been married, and to whom? Where did they meet? Blind date? Chance? Business meeting? Is it a good marriage? A marriage where they take each other for granted? The marriage of Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) and his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) in Cinderella Man is a good example. Their marriage is tested all the way though the film, and their commitment to each other and their children adds another dimension to the character. In the same way, the relationship between Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and his unseen daughter in Million Dollar Baby (Paul Haggis)—captured only by the letters he writes her, which are all returned—gives us a deeper insight into Frankie’s relationship with Maggie (Hilary Swank). What happened between Frankie and his daughter that caused the rift? Why is there such enmity there? And even though it’s only alluded to, it adds a strong motivational device in Frankie’s relationship with his protégé.

			The private life is what your character does when he or she is alone. What hobbies or interests does he or she have? Jogging? Exercise class? Hatha Yoga? Taking university extension courses? Cooking, woodworking classes, fixing up a house, painting, writing, gardening? Defining your character’s private life is a great way to add depth and dimension to your character.

			In one of director John Frankenheimer’s films, the main character, a detective, takes a gourmet French cooking class one night a week. The detective’s dream is to learn how to make a special soufflé. He’s hunting a serial killer and when he tracks him down, it happens to be on the same night they were preparing the soufflé. It’s a great little touch. In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne’s hobby is carving chess pieces out of rocks. Later, we’ll learn that this same interest leads to tunneling his way out of the Shawshank Penitentiary.

			Write about your character’s professional, personal, and private life in about two or three pages each. Use free-association; just let it come out. Define it, articulate it, but don’t censor it. As you go through the exercise, remember you’re engaging in a process that reveals character. It’s just one of the tools of creating character.

			Another tool that you can use to expand your ability to create characters is Research. There are two kinds of research, live research and textual research.

			In live research, you interview people for ideas, thoughts, feelings, experience, and background material. Suppose you’re writing a story about an auto body shop that specializes in customizing cars and you want to know how it functions and operates. Find out if there are any shops like this in your area. If need be, do a Google search on it, or check the Yellow Pages. If you can talk to the people in management, or the designers, and the people who work in the garage, you’ll get an insight into the people and the environment.

			Write out a list of questions you want to ask, and take a small audio recorder to record your subjects and a notebook to write your impressions. (A cautionary note: you should always ask permission to record them, whether by phone or in person. Most of the time they’ll say yes, especially if you tell them you’re writing a screenplay or teleplay. If they ask for you for money to pay for their time, or some kind of fee up front, look for someone else.) Most people will share their expertise. Besides, if you write the script, sell it, and it goes into production, the producer may ask your subject to be some kind of consultant on the movie.

			If you read a newspaper story and you want to talk to the subject(s) of the article, call the paper, ask for the reporter who wrote the story, and see if you can get in touch with them. Call them and explain your interest and ask if you can interview them. See what you can learn. A friend of mine, a well-known studio executive turned writer, wrote a story about a professional assassin. He finished the first draft and told me he wasn’t satisfied with it and asked me to read it. I did, and while the subject was good, the story was superficial, lacking in depth and dimension. I asked how much research he had done and was surprised when he replied, “Just a little.” I told him it showed, and he should think about researching his main character before he began the rewrite.

			I happened to recall that Rolling Stone had published an in-depth interview with a professional assassin a few months earlier, and I mentioned it to my friend. He called Rolling Stone, talked to the reporter who had done the piece, located the assassin, and arranged to interview him over the phone. My friend learned more about the world of the assassin than he ever conceived. (In the same way, one of the reasons that the Vincent character in Collateral was so well drawn was because of the extensive research the screenwriter, Stuart Beattie, did to prepare.) After my friend talked with the assassin, he rewrote his script and made an agreement that if the film was ever made, the writer would ask that the assassin be hired as a special consultant at a very good salary. He couldn’t promise that, of course, but he could request it of the producer or director. Later, the script was optioned by a producer, and a few months after that it was sold to a studio and became a “go” project; the assassin was asked to be an advisor on the film.

			Recently, I was writing a futuristic science-fiction screenplay and needed information about a powerful cosmic phenomenon that would impact the earth. I called the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, spoke to the public relations person and told her what I was looking for, and she guided me to two scientists who worked in the area of gamma ray bursts. I set up an appointment with them, took my tape recorder with me, and recorded their thoughts and ideas on the topic. I even used some of their ideas when I wrote the screenplay. That’s the value of live research.

			Textual research is where you go to the library, museum, or institution and get information from books, periodicals, microfiche, or old newspapers. When I was making documentaries at David L. Wolper Productions, my first assignment was doing research, and I became quite adept at “finding” things. I found the very first modeling stills of a seventeen-year-old Grace Kelly. I uncovered the original footage taken on one of the boats during the infamous Bay of Pigs invasion and was then questioned by officials from the State Department and FBI who wanted to know how and where I found it. I uncovered the very first filmed acting job (a short industrial film for the Union 76 Gas Company) by a young actress who would later be known as Marilyn Monroe.

			If you’re looking for information about your subject matter, either a character or event, search the library for any books or magazines written on the subject. If you find something that looks appealing, search through the table of contents. Does it seem interesting? Does it apply to the area you’re interested in? Look through a couple of chapters. Is it easy to read? Does it have enough facts and detail to help illuminate your subject? Three or four books should provide you with enough material to keep you busy for a few weeks. If necessary, you can always go back and get other books later. You don’t want to be overloaded with too much information that may not even be necessary.

			A few years ago, I was researching a project about an archeologist in the field and I wanted to get some background information. I called the archeology department at UCLA and arranged to interview a graduate student who had just come back from a field trip. Then I called the Museum of Northern Arizona, where the story took place, and spoke to the reference librarian, who sent me a complete catalogue of books, articles, films, and names of people I could talk to. It was an invaluable tool.

			Check out magazines and newspapers. Refer to Readers’ Guide to Periodical Literature and The New York Times Index. If you need help finding books or periodicals, go to the reference desk of the library. The librarians are usually extremely helpful. Also check the bibliography in the back of any books you may find. I start every project that way, whether it’s an original screenplay or a documentary film. That way I know what’s been written on the subject.

			Research is a wonderful tool to expand and broaden both characters and story. Seabiscuit is a good example of how research can effectively broaden the historical perspectives of the story line, not only in the plot but also in pictures and the newsreels of the time. It is a wonderful tool that can capture a time and place as well as inspire incidents or events that you can draw upon for your story.

			What about dialogue? Dialogue is a tool of character. It’s also a function of character. It’s true that some writers have a better ear for writing dialogue than others, but if you know your character well enough, if you feel comfortable inside his or her skin, the dialogue will be individual and appropriate enough to capture the “essence” of that character. You can say things, show things, or explain things in order to reveal character.

			One of the questions I continually get asked is, “How can I improve my dialogue?” When I ask what’s wrong with it, the writer’s response is usually “it’s weak, stilted, awkward, phony, and all sounds the same.” They might be right.

			People get hung up on dialogue because they don’t understand what it is, or what it does. They put too much importance on it. They say good dialogue is “everything” in a script, and when they start writing and their dialogue doesn’t match their expectations, they become concerned, insecure, or sometimes angry and depressed. Soon after, they’ll find themselves censoring their work, judging and evaluating it and becoming supercritical. If they continue in this manner, they’ll probably stop writing altogether because they don’t feel their dialogue is good enough.

			So what? Dialogue is experiential. The more you do the easier it gets. When you sit down to write, you’ll probably end up writing 50 to 60 pages of shitty dialogue. Let it be terrible! It doesn’t matter at this stage. You’re going to rewrite it later, so let yourself be willing to write some awful dialogue. Most words-on-paper drafts will probably be this way. Nobody can write perfect dialogue in the first words-on-paper draft. Writing good dialogue is a skill, like playing the piano, swimming, or riding a bike. The more you do it the easier it gets. Never mind how good or how bad it is. Trust the process. It’s larger than you are. Let your characters speak for themselves. Just keep writing. Be aware of any judgments or evaluations you’re making, and don’t let them influence you. Easier said than done, of course. Just be willing to write some shitty dialogue. Don’t get locked into the trap of wanting to write perfect dialogue from page one, word one.

			What’s the purpose of dialogue? It serves two functions: it either moves the story forward or it reveals character. The next time you watch a film, preferably at home on a DVD where you can study the film, listen to the dialogue. Take a piece of paper and mark down what the dialogue accomplishes in each scene. If you want, you can literally chart each scene into some aspect of these two functions. Try it and see if I’m right.

			Just know that if you’re willing to write 50 or 60 pages of terrible dialogue, most of the time it will clear up in the natural process of writing. You’ll find certain little phrases or expressions, particular cadences or rhythms of their dialogue that will tend to individualize your character. By the end of the first words-on-paper draft, you’ll be amazed at the change. When you rewrite those pages, your dialogue will improve tremendously. For some people, writing dialogue is a gift they’re born with. But for most of us, it’s something we can develop.

			There are tools you can use to help you write more effective dialogue. One is using a cassette or digital recorder to record a conversation with a friend or acquaintance. Play it back and listen to it. Notice how fragmented it is, how quickly thoughts come and go. If you want to see what “real” dialogue looks like, type it up in screenplay form. Listen for mannerisms and inflections; find the style of speech, the phrasing. Then think about your character speaking in those “rhythms,” or in that “language.”

			One of my students, a well-known journalist, was writing a screenplay she had been thinking about for years. Her writing style was elegant and readable. Her dialogue was beautiful. That is, it read beautifully on the page—every sentence was clear and concise, every idea complete in thought and execution. The language and punctuation were perfect.

			But when you read it aloud, it didn’t work at all. People don’t speak in skilled and elegant prose. Real people talk in fragments, run-on sentences, and incomplete thoughts, and they change mood and subject with the blink of an eye. Just listen to people speaking; you’ll get a whole new perception of how people talk. Dialogue is not spoken in beautiful prose or iambic pentameter. We’re not doing Shakespeare here.

			A screenplay is a reading experience before it becomes a visual one. As mentioned, one of the main functions of dialogue is to move the story forward. In that regard, it must communicate necessary facts and information to the reader so he or she knows what is happening as the story line progresses.

			Moving the story forward means providing the exposition needed so the reader and the character knows what’s going on. Exposition is defined as the necessary information to move the story forward or reveal information about a character. Exposition is usually, but not always, achieved through dialogue; characters talk about what happened in order to establish the next direction in the story line. Too much exposition becomes trite, mundane, and boring. You really don’t need much of it; you just need to set things up.

			A good example is The Shawshank Redemption. When Andy Dufresne enters prison, the first scene shows the new prisoners walking into a large admitting area. The warden introduces himself and lays down the rules of the prison. “I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that’s why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I’ll not have the Lord’s name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you’ll figure out as you go along.”

			Simple. Plain. Just enough to set up the story and an indication of what’s going to happen next. When one of the prisoners asks, “When do we eat?” we see him severely beaten for speaking out of turn. Those are the “rules.” You can also provide exposition visually, as in American Beauty. The opening shots show the city, the street, and the house where Lester lives. In voiceover we hear Lester say: “My name is Lester Burnham. I’m forty-two years old. In less than a year, I’ll be dead…that’s my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That’s not an accident.”

			The second function of dialogue is to reveal character. That can be accomplished in many ways. Sometimes you’ll be direct, as in exposition, and other times you’ll want to be indirect, that is, playing against the grain of the scene, meaning in an unobvious or unexpected way. Things may look great, and the conversational dialogue may be warm, friendly, and open, but what the characters are talking about may be harsh and loaded with venom. The dining room scene in American Beauty is a good example of this. Lester, his wife Carolyn, and their daughter Jane are sitting at the dining room table having dinner. There are candles on the table, a beautiful flower arrangement, chilled wine, and soft music playing in the background. It looks absolutely great, an American family having their evening meal together.

			But the subject of the scene is all about complaints: “Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?” daughter Jane whines. And Carolyn replies: “No. We don’t. As soon as you’ve prepared a nutritious yet flavorful meal that I’m about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.” And it goes downhill from there, ending in anger, silence, and guilt.

			Another way to reveal character is to have other people shed light upon the character through dialogue. Henry James had a theory he called The Theory of Illumination, where he put forth the idea that the main character of the story occupies the center of a circle, and on the periphery of the circle are all the other characters in the story. Each time a character interacts with the main character, he or she “illuminates” a different aspect of the main character, like walking into a darkened room and turning on floor lamps in each corner of the room. In the same way, dialogue illuminates and reveals something about the character.

			Sometimes, you can play a scene using the tool of subtext. Subtext is what is not said during the scene. A friend of mine, an actor who had roles in several television series, was out of work and needed a job. A dear friend of his had just gotten hired to direct a big movie. It had been a while since they had seen each other, so they set up a time to get together. The need of my friend, of course, was to see if there would be a part for him in the film. The director’s need was to be noncommittal. So, they got together and during the meal, what was the one thing they didn’t talk about? That my friend needed a job. That’s subtext.

			There’s a great little scene in Annie Hall that captures this. Alvy Singer has just met Annie Hall and they go back to her place for a drink. They walk out on the balcony and as they talk to each other, subtitles flash on the screen about what they’re really thinking, which totally contradict what they’re saying to each other. It’s a great scene to illustrate the depth and dimension we can achieve by using subtext.

			The drama of confrontation is another way of writing effective dialogue. Since you want to create conflict in your scenes, either from an exterior force or from within the character, you can create a verbal confrontation. In Sideways, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are constantly confronting each other because they want different things. Miles wants to enjoy the wine-tasting experience and Jack wants to get laid. Two characters having opposing points of view allow you to create dialogue that generates conflict to keep the story moving forward and illustrate character.

			Dialogue is also a good transition device. A word or visual transition connects one scene to another, scene A with scene B. You might end a scene with one character saying something, then cut into a new scene with another character continuing the same dialogue. For example, you can end one scene with a character asking a question and then open the next scene with another character answering that question. This is effectively done in The Silence of the Lambs (Ted Tally) and Julia (Alvin Sargent). You can write a montage sequence—a visual series of scenes, connected by one single idea, with a definite beginning, middle, and end. American Beauty illustrates this beautifully in the real estate sequence. Carolyn wants to sell a house and shows it to several different people. The dialogue is continuous as it plays over each scene with different characters in various locations in the house, but the whole sequence could really be one scene. It’s a way to condense time, place, and action.

			These are the tools of character. Creating full and dimensional characters and writing effective dialogue illuminates and reveals character.

			And that’s what it’s all about.


				THE EXERCISE

				Write character biographies for two or three of your main characters in about seven to ten pages, or more if necessary. Focus on their early years. Where was the character born? What did his or her father and mother do for a living? What is his relationship with his parents? Does he or she have any brothers or sisters? What’s the relationship—friendly and supportive or angry and combative?

				Define the other relationships the character has in his or her second and third decade and see how these relationships formed his or her character. Remember Henry James’ Theory of Illumination: every character sheds light on your main character.

				Before you begin writing your biography, think about your character(s) for a few days, then set aside a time where you can work for two or three hours without interruption. No phone calls, no TV, no email, video games, or visits from friends. It may help to lower the lights or turn on some soft music, maybe drink half a glass of wine to take the edge off. Anything more and you’ll be writing to get drunk. Then start “throwing down” thoughts, words, and ideas about the character. Just let it come out. Don’t worry about grammar, punctuation, spelling, or bad writing. Just get your thoughts down on paper, and don’t worry about anything else. You’re not going to show these pages to anyone; it’s only a tool for you to use while you discover and get to know your characters. If you want to include parts of your character biography in your screenplay, fine. But just get your character down on paper. Let your characters discover who they are.

				Do the same with the professional, personal, and private lives of your character. Write a page or two about what your character does for a living, his or her relationships and hobbies. You might even craft a “day in the life” of your character and write what her typical day looks like. What does she do from the moment she gets out of bed till she goes to sleep at night? Write it in a page or two. If you need to write more, write more. If you can do it in less, do it in less.

				If you discover any areas in a character’s life you feel unsure or insecure about, write it in a page or two. Free-associate. Do some research if necessary. The relationship between you and your characters is like the relationship between two best friends. You decide what you need, then define it.

				If you don’t know whether you should write something or not, write it! Don’t self-edit at this stage. It’s your script, your story, your characters, your dramatic choices. When you have completed your assignment, you’ll know your characters as if they were good friends.

			Conflict and the Circle of Being


			 				“The only thing that’s important is the story, and the story arises from the conflict between the characters. And you can only evolve that by beginning with their needs and motives, and by bringing them together, and they will create the story for you.”

				 					 						—Frank Pierson

						Dog Day Afternoon, Cool Hand Luke





			When you’re writing the screenplay, the most essential aspect to keep in mind is that all drama is conflict. Many writers seem to forget that. If the purpose of the scene in a screenplay is to either move the story forward, or reveal information about the character, the writer sometimes feels that telling the story means moving the character through the action like a chess piece without focusing on the conflict.

			Why is conflict so important in writing the screenplay?

			Because it creates tension, rhythm, suspense, and keeps the readers, or viewers, on the edge of their collective seats. A movie is larger than life, and if you want to write a script that brings a certain order to the world, you need to engage the reader. That means generating conflict.

			The word conflict means “in opposition to.” In literary terms, it’s usually defined as “creating the force of opposition between the characters and the actions that helps shape or motivate the plot.” If you have a character with a strong and defined dramatic need, then you can create obstacles to that need and the story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need. If your character has a strong and distinct point of view, and you have another character with the opposite point of view, the result is a strong and continued conflict within the scene. And that’s what it’s all about, sustaining conflict either in an emotional or physical context.

			Cold Mountain is a good example that illustrates the multidimensional complexities of conflict. Charles Frazier’s novel, adapted by director Anthony Minghella, is set during the American Civil War, a bloody and brutal time that violently divided the nation along the lines of politics and geography.

			The focus of the story is on three characters: Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter, is a man of many talents and few words. Ada (Nicole Kidman), is a young woman raised to be a Southern “belle,” daughter of a Baptist Minister, who can read, write, play the piano, and be the perfect “hostess.” Ruby (Renée Zellweger) is a feisty drifter who teaches Ada about strength and self-reliance and reveals a kind of world that Ada has never known or dreamed of. Three lives, uprooted by war, learn to depend upon each other to endure their physical and spiritual survival together.

			And then, there’s Cold Mountain, a little town sheltered in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, which represents a time, a place, and a way of life that has been forever lost. Cold Mountain is really like a beacon of love, a place that resides in the heart.

			Cold Mountain is all about conflict and that is established and set up with the dramatic situation. The story takes place during the conflict between the states that ushers in the changing way of life in America. In change there is always conflict. The story begins in flashback, as Union soldiers tunnel under a Confederate camp planting explosives. We are introduced to Inman as he rereads one of many letters sent by Ada, sharing her hopes and dreams with him in voiceover. Already, this provides a stark visual contrast to Inman and the Confederate camp. Even while we hear Ada’s words, we watch the Union soldiers light the fuse. Then all hell breaks loose. The attacking Union Army finds itself stuck in the landfill and the Confederates stand on all sides of the crater firing their guns into the mass of humanity. So it begins.

			In the midst of this madness and confusion we flash back to a time two years earlier, in Cold Mountain, and we see Inman’s memories of meeting Ada. Already, the opposition of forces in the story generates the conflict: North versus South, right versus wrong, the state versus the individual, and so on.

			Inman, wounded in a later skirmish, listens to the words of Ada, “Come back, my love,” and chooses to desert the Confederate Army and flee this madness of war. He wants to make his way home to the woman he loves, and is driven by his dramatic need to return to Cold Mountain. Like Homer’s Odyssey, Inman’s trek is a story about a man whose desire is to return home, and during the course of his journey, he confronts all kinds of obstacles placed in his path. His story becomes a supreme test of courage, of pride, of romantic love and loyalty. He must hide and flee from the enemy as well as the Confederate bounty hunters. He must endure starvation and fatigue, and confront his own issues of fear and doubt as he travels to Cold Mountain, a journey on foot of more than three hundred miles over harsh and sometimes impassable terrain. It is an amazing journey. Every step he takes back to Cold Mountain becomes a form of conflict to confront and overcome.

			The mythology of the journey is a universal theme in all human expression and is expressed and imitated no matter what our language, culture, color, or location. We’re all on this same path in life, from birth to death and our job is “to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us,” as Gandalf says in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

			The universal theme of the journey is expressed in March of the Penguins (adapted by Jordan Roberts, from the French documentary by Luc Jacquet and Michel Fessler). In this extraordinary documentary, we follow the Emperor penguins as they journey back to their breeding grounds in Antarctica and confront the harsh and severe obstacles of their environment. It captures their intense will to survive and in their journey we see the emotional foundation of all drama: exposition, conflict, complication, narrative progression, transition, surprise, climax, and resolution.

			If we want to create the context of conflict, we see there are two kinds: one is internal conflict and the other is external conflict. Inman chooses to desert and return to Ada, so fear, doubt, love, perseverance, enduring the hazards of survival, either taking or not taking action, all represent an internal conflict. External conflict is the force or forces that work outside the character—the hazards of war, weather, physical terrain, temptations, as well as the physical hardships.

			In Cold Mountain, Ada is a well-educated, city-bred woman who has always been protected by her father (Donald Sutherland). In the wake of his unexpected death and Inman’s absence, Ada finds herself totally alone on the farm, in the middle of extreme danger, without the vaguest idea of how to fend for herself. Faced with starvation, attack, and the possibility that Inman may never return, Ada must learn to adapt and live off the land and trust the self-reliant Ruby. Ruby teaches her how to plant crops, mend and fix fences, and take care of herself. Together they find a way to survive in the midst of the hostility and bloodshed that surrounds them.

			Explore your character’s internal life to find and dramatize conflict within the screenplay. Waldo Salt once told me that the key to a successful screenplay is in preparing the material. Dialogue, he said, as mentioned earlier, is “perishable,” because an actor can always improvise lines to make it work. But, he added forcefully, the character’s dramatic need is sacred; it is what holds the entire story in place. Putting words down on paper, Waldo said, was the easiest part of the screenwriting process.

			Conflict is a major factor in creating character. In most cases, the forces confronting the character will be a combination of both internal and external. Conflict in your story is a source of tension that powers the narrative thrust to move through the story line.

			Sometimes, the conflict confronting your character is a reaction to the specific scene or moment in the screenplay. In Crimson Tide, an Emergency Action Message has been received ordering the nuclear submarine to launch its nuclear missiles. Soon after, another Emergency Action Message comes in, but the transmission is severed before the entire message can be read. What does it say? Does it confirm the launch of the missiles? Or does it cancel the previous order? What to do or not do because of this message is the major conflict within the film and tension and suspense is heightened until the proper course of action can be initiated. An uneasy truce is agreed upon while they fix the radio to see what the orders say. And it is during this wait of a few minutes that conflict is initiated by what is not said. It heightens and adds to the suspense of the moment. The conversation between the two main characters, played by Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, doesn’t address “the problem of the message.” Instead, the characters discuss whether the famous Lipizzaner horses of Vienna are black or white. This conversation not only reflects the subtext of the scene, but also any racial implications that might exist between the two men. It’s a great example of illustrating conflict within the tension of the moment.

			In Collateral, the conflict starts with the dramatic need of the taxi driver character, Max, who is hired for the night by Vincent, a hit man contracted to commit five murders. When Max discovers Vincent’s intention, he literally becomes an accessory to the crime and though he tries to get away, he cannot. Once the conflict is established, it drives the action forward, becoming the fuel that feeds the narrative. In Max’s case, the external conflict gives rise to the internal conflict. For twelve years, Max has had a dream of starting his own limousine service. Every night as he begins his shift, he goes through his personal routine; he cleans the cab, inserts his little picture of a desert island behind the sun visor, and dreams about his new Mercedes limousine. But by the end of Act II, as mentioned, Max realizes he’s been living a “someday” life—“someday” he’ll have enough money to start his own limo service, “someday” he’ll leave this taxi business behind him and do what he really wants to do. And those “someday” dreams, as we all know, never happen. The collision between a character’s dreams and reality generates conflict. Wes Anderson’s Rushmore is a good example of this.

			That’s the nature of conflict. As you begin creating and formulating your character(s), see if you can create an internal or external conflict that will help drive the story forward.

			Remember, the purpose of the scene is to either move the story forward or reveal information about the character. The dramatic core of achieving that is generating conflict—conflict within, or conflict without.

			Conflict can create dimensions that infuse the character and story line in a number of significant ways. In Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson’s brilliant screenplay, the themes of reconciliation and forgiveness are woven throughout the story and reveal how the past actions of parents shape and influence the behavior of their children. Earl (Jason Robards) is dying of cancer and on his deathbed he seeks forgiveness for leaving his then fourteen-year-old son Frank (Tom Cruise) alone to care for his dying mother.

			This incident of Earl walking out on his dying wife has affected Frank’s life profoundly, leading him to develop a lifestyle where he channels his anger into convincing men to use sex as a weapon to “destroy the opposite sex.” When Frank finally does confront Earl on his deathbed, Frank is able to complete his relationship with his dying father. This scene illustrates how certain facts uncovered within the character biography might help shape and form a character’s life. Through the character biography, you can form your characters, then reveal them by showing who they are in the story line. Ibsen’s great play Ghosts deals with some of these same themes, about the sins of the father being passed on to the son.

			One of the ways to accomplish this is by performing an exercise I call the Circle of Being. It’s a process that allows you to uncover an incident in your character’s life that emotionally impacts your story line; typically, it’s an incident or event that occurs to your main character when he or she is between the ages of nine and eighteen. This is a very formative time, during which a traumatic event could possibly affect the entire course of a character’s life. This event might be the death of a parent or loved one, some sort of physical abuse that results in a deep emotional scar or physical injury, or a move to a new city or country.

			I call this event the Circle of Being because if you picture your character as a circle, and then slice the events of his or her life like dividing a pie, you can evoke the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, social, mystical, political, traumatic, and intellectual incidents or events of their life that impact their behavior. By doing this exercise, you can create a well-rounded portrait of your character that evokes the emotions, thoughts, and feelings that expand and deepen your characterization.

			Thelma & Louise is a good example of the Circle of Being event and how it’s used. Callie Khouri’s screenplay does not explicitly mention that Louise was raped and unable to receive justice when she was growing up in Texas. Although it is only insinuated once or twice during the screenplay, Louise’s past ordeal impacts her physical, mental, and emotional behavior throughout the movie. “If you blow a guy’s head off with his pants down,” she says, “Texas is the last place you want to get caught!” Carrying the anger and hurt of this burden is what ultimately leads to the incident that powers the entire story line, the shooting of Thelma’s would-be rapist in the parking lot. It explains why Louise pulls the trigger in the first place, and why she vows to never set one foot inside the state of Texas.

			“I’d rather be caught dead,” she states emphatically. And, of course, it becomes a prophetic remark. From Oklahoma City, the only way to get to Mexico without going through Texas is the long way around, through Utah and Arizona. It is this decision that ultimately costs both women their lives, and at this point, they wouldn’t have it any other way. This Circle of Being event, I feel, is triggered in the parking lot when Louise sees Harlan attempting to rape Thelma. Louise totally loses it and pulls the trigger, killing Harlan. To me, the Louise pulling the trigger in that parking lot is not the Louise of the present time; rather, it is the young girl who was raped in Texas many years earlier.

			Later, Hal, the police detective (Harvey Keitel), tells her on the phone, “I know what happened in Texas,” and a little later Thelma, referring to the rape attempt, guesses that “it happened to you, didn’t it?” To the very end, Louise does not respond.

			Creating a Circle of Being event for your character is an invaluable tool to use in crafting and enriching your character. If you go into your character’s life and ask yourself what traumatic incident might have occurred in your character’s life between the ages of nine and eighteen, see what happens. You might even explore your own life and see what, if any, traumatic event might have occurred in your life during this time frame.

			Why nine to eighteen? First, because it seems to be the most formative period in a person’s life and results in specific behavioral patterns that remain either consciously or unconsciously in the psyche. The noted behaviorist Joseph Chilton Pierce states there are four major periods of growth, or spurts, of human intelligence. The first intelligence growth period occurs when the child is about a year old, when they learn to walk. The second intellectual spurt occurs when the child is about four years old and learns that he or she has a distinct identity and communication skills. The third stage of intellectual growth occurs when the child is about nine or ten; that’s the age when he understands that he has a singular and individual voice and begins to question authority, forming his or her own opinions about what’s right or wrong and starts speaking his mind. This is a vital time in the life of the young person.

			The fourth stage of human intelligence, and perhaps the most important developmental spurt according to Pierce, occurs when the person is about fifteen or sixteen—the teenager. That’s the age when the young person starts rebelling against authority and tries to find his or her own voice; she suddenly understands that her parents are no longer the center of the universe, and she looks outward, into the world for models of behavior. The young person is heavily influenced by his peers, and may begin to dress differently, color his hair, get body piercings or tattoos, and experiment with drugs, actions which are more acceptable to his peers than to his parents or society. But these actions express teenagers’ individuality and who they are within the context of their own peer group. They have an identity. Just look at your own kids, or your nieces or nephews, or your friends’ kids, and how they dress, act, and react.

			It’s a period of a person’s development so influential that it can leave a subconscious imprint for the rest of his life, much like furniture leaves an impression in the rug. Take a moment and look back into your own life and see how influential this time was. Just close your eyes and go back to the time when you were about that age, anywhere from nine to eighteen, or thereabouts, and see if there was any specific incident or event that affected you the most. What was the incident or event that springs to mind? Take a moment to consider how that event might have affected you and possibly changed your life.

			If you go back into your character’s life and create an incident or event that becomes a major influence, then you can enhance the texture and depth of any character you’re writing. By creating a Circle of Being event you can generate conflict or a plot complication that will expand the dimension of your character.

			One of my students, a well-known and working playwright, wanted to make the switch from writing for the stage to writing for the screen. He had an interesting story that involved the reconciliation of two sisters after an absence of many years. The story opens with the main character, a dentist, undergoing a dental procedure. While under the influence of the anesthesia, she flashes back to a time when she was a young girl and witnessed her sister being raped by their uncle. Fearful of being seen, she ran away and in her flight, tripped over a rock, fell, and injured her front teeth—the same teeth which are acting up now. She had totally repressed the memory of this event until now and it leads her to reconcile with her sister. This Circle of Being event sparked the entire story. The themes of reconciliation and forgiveness thus became the narrative thrust of the screenplay. I suggested to the writer that we see the Circle of Being event as the story unfolds in visual bits and pieces scattered throughout the screenplay. She recovers the incident in visual fragments, and the final script turned out to be very powerful material. The Bourne Supremacy uses this same kind of visual technique throughout the narrative as we see fragments of Bourne’s memory as he tries to recall the murder of the politician Neski and his wife, in Berlin. It adds tension and power to the film experience.

			That’s the influence of the Circle of Being. Once you’ve created an experience or incident that affects the life of your character, then you can base the character’s emotional arc on that incident and have him or her confront and resolve (or not resolve) the experience. It becomes a way of embellishing character, creating a strong, defined point of view and attitude, and contains within it the spark of conflict. Some films use the Circle of Being as the basis of the story line, and it becomes the subject of the entire film.

			Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is another good example of this. Both Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 deal with the theme of revenge. But it is the Circle of Being event that defines the story of The Bride (Uma Thurman) and O-Ren (Lucy Liu), her opponent in Part I. In an animation sequence, we see how O-Ren becomes the leader of the Japanese underworld. As a child, she witnesses the murder of her parents by a Japanese gangster. She lies huddled under the bed during the butchery and swears eternal revenge. A few years later, she gets her revenge by seducing her parent’s killer and murdering him and his henchmen. She becomes the most notorious assassin in Japan and soon rises to the top of the Japanese underworld. This ultimately leads to the showdown between O-Ren and The Bride that occupies almost the entire second half of the first film. We see in graphic detail how the Circle of Being event changed O-Ren’s life.

			Sometimes you’ll be able to find a Circle of Being event for your character with no problem whatsoever and it will just flow naturally from the character biography. Other times it may not be so easy. You may have to work, struggle, think, ponder, reflect, and contemplate what the Circle of Being event might be in your character’s life.

			In The Silence of the Lambs, the Circle of Being plays a prominent part in the transformation of Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young FBI trainee tracking a serial killer, who must come to grips with an incident that occurred in her own childhood. That incident, the death of her father, a small-town policeman killed during an attempted robbery, creates a major gap in her life and has influenced a subconscious search for a father figure.

			The extraordinary screenplay by Ted Tally focuses on Clarice’s relationship with three fathers: her real, biological father, who’s kind of a ghost figure during the action; Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), the Director of the Behavioral Science Division at the FBI Academy, who’s loving but stern, and remains somewhat distant; and the brilliant but deadly Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who becomes a kind of mentor to her, guiding and teaching her what to look for when pursuing the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. As The Silence of the Lambs unfolds, each one of Clarice’s “fathers” has something to teach her as she walks the path from being the student to being the professional.

			The search for the father is a major theme in literature. Many times, a person’s character, psychologists say, is reflected in the search for the father, but in reality, it is really searching for your own true nature. Often, a person searches for their destiny as their destiny is searching for them.

			The death of Clarice’s father is the Circle of Being event in her life. Because of her father’s death, she is sent to live with an uncle in Montana. One night, she’s awakened by the screaming of lambs being slaughtered. When she is caught trying to rescue one of the baby lambs, she is sent away to an orphanage. Hannibal Lecter forces her to look at this emotional event she’s been shielding and allows her to recreate it, thus becoming free of it. By the end of the film she has transformed her life. She is now on the threshold of building a new life, not only in terms of her relationship to men but professionally as a top-notch FBI agent. Only when she is able to confront this incident in her past can she truly be free.

			How can the Circle of Being affect your screenplay? In many ways, obviously, but I find its importance is that it provides a source of conflict, either inner or outer, that your character must confront during the story line.

			One of my favorite examples is Seabiscuit. We see Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) being given away because his family cannot take care of him. Can you imagine being given away by your parents when you’re about fifteen because they can’t take care of you?

			This is Red’s Circle of Being scene, and though it is taken from a real event in his life, it is something that could be discovered while writing the character biography. In the film, Red is watching a horse race in a carnival when his father approaches, carrying a pillowcase filled with his favorite books. “I’m so sorry,” his father begins. He looks at Red. There are tears in his eyes. The trainer, his father says, “has a house. A real house…There’s even a phone next door so we can call you every couple of weeks and let you know where we are….” “No,” Red cries. His father reaches down, hugs his son.

			Red doesn’t know what’s happening. “You’ll be great at this [racing horses],” his father whispers. “You’ve got a gift…we’ll come back.” Then he hugs his son again wanting to believe his own words. “We will….We will.” His mother weeps.

			Red watches, still confused “as his father leans back. He looks around the fading light of the race track/fairground. Mr. Pollard looks at his son for a moment as the CAMERA begins to pull back, rapidly leaving them a small part of the crowd….” Then, they cut to the next scene.

			It’s a small scene but quite an emotional moment. The impact on Red is enormous—it is what influences and shapes his life, a life built upon negative self-worth and deep-seated anger. Emotionally, being given away by his parents has led him to believe that he’s not good enough as a person and we see that in his behavior as he lashes out at everyone he is close to.

			The Circle of Being event is the source of inner conflict that Red must confront and deal with for the rest of his life. He doesn’t feel he deserves anything. As the story progresses, we see his internal conflicts about his own self-respect and self-worth.

			I feel a Circle of Being event can also apply to animals. As mentioned, I think Seabiscuit is a real character in this movie. He was given away at six months, just like Red Pollard, because he did not fit the image of what a racehorse should be. He was taught to lose, not allowed to win a race. Is it any wonder that he “forgot what it’s like to be a horse”?

			Seabiscuit is affected by his real-life Circle of Being event. The narrator tells us that: “Seabiscuit was the son of Hard Tack, sired by the mighty horse Man O’ War….At six months he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons [who] decided the horse was lazy….Where his sire had been a fierce, almost violent competitor, Seabiscuit took to sleeping for huge chunks of the day and enjoyed lolling for hours under the boughs of the juniper trees. So, they made him a training partner to ‘better’ horses, forcing him to lose head to head to boost the confidence of the other animal….When they finally did race him, he did just what they had trained him to do….He lost….And, of course, it all made sense….Champions were large. They were sleek. They were without imperfection. This horse ran as they had always expected him to run….”

			That is the power of the Circle of Being event in your character’s life. It can be the source of conflict in the narrative line of action, whether animal or human. Film is a visual medium—a story told in pictures. As the ancient text of the Yoga Vashista states, “The world is as you see it.” Your story is held together by its characters and conflict and becomes the arena where your character(s) confront the tremendous challenges of the world. Conflict and the Circle of Being are the key that ignites the engine and powers your character through the story line.


				THE EXERCISE

				 					Rent or buy the DVD of Cold Mountain, Seabiscuit, Thelma & Louise, or Magnolia and study it from the point of view of conflict and the Circle of Being. If need be, write a free-association essay of what you notice in terms of conflict.

				All drama is conflict. So when you’re thinking of creating your main character(s), it’s important to think about finding ways to generate conflict. There are either internal or external forces working on your character that can help you articulate and define some of the conflicts your character encounters during the course of the screenplay.

				Once you define the dramatic situation, see if you can break the arena of conflict into an external source, or an internal one, or any combination of internal or external conflicts. Think about the external forces working on your character. What are they? Can you define and articulate them? Just write them down in a free-association essay in about a page or two.

				Go into your character biography and see what kind of Circle of Being event you can create for your character. Sometimes, an event will just “pop out” on the page and at other times you may have to dig into your character’s emotional life to find it. Even if you don’t actually use the Circle of Being event in your screenplay, it’s good to know your character has a history that you can draw upon while writing.

			Of Time and Memory


			 				Jason Bourne: “What’s going on in Berlin?”

				 					 						—Tony Gilroy

						The Bourne Supremacy





			The great Italian filmmaker, Michelangelo Antonioni, once stated that “film is a language that bypasses the mind and speaks directly to the heart.” There’s no doubt this comment permeated his exploration into the human spirit in several of his great films: L’Avventura, La Notte, Eclipse, Red Desert, Blow-Up, Zabriskie Point, The Passenger, and others.

			In The Passenger, David Locke, played by Jack Nicholson, is a world-weary journalist hunting for a story in North Africa when he discovers an Englishman in his hotel dead from a heart attack. After a long, silent deliberation, David, weary of his own life, disillusioned with his job and isolated in his marriage, assumes the man’s identity and so cuts the restraints of his past life and sets out to forge a new life with a new identity. Of course, he doesn’t know what the future will bring, or what the destiny is of the man whose identity he has assumed. He meets up with a detached young woman (Maria Schneider), and begins keeping the dead man’s shadowy appointments in London, Munich, and throughout Spain, because “he believed in something.” Only later does David learn the man was selling guns.

			In one scene, David is driving a rented convertible with the top down along one of those long country roads outside London that are lined with tall trees. The girl, Maria Schneider, is in the passenger seat and she looks over at him and asks, “What are you running from?” He replies by telling her to turn around. She looks behind her and we watch from her point of view as the empty and barren road disappears behind them. The moment holds as we see that he’s leaving his past behind, and moving into an unencumbered present, leading to an unknown and uncertain future. It is cinema at its highest.

			When I grasped the realization of that moment, I found it affected me on a deep, and profound, emotional level. No words, only pictures and the coursing recognition that we’re traveling on this road of life carrying our past behind like some unwanted luggage. I’ve often wondered what it would be like if we could simply drop our past and step into the present moment free of time and memory.

			When I see a film I like, I respond immediately, on an emotional, intuitive level. Either I like it or I don’t. Either it works or it doesn’t. Oh yes, I can talk endlessly about the visual brilliance of the director, the great performances of the actors, the broad sweep of the photography, the poetry of the editing, or the ingeniousness of the special effects. But when I get right down to it, there’s only one thing that holds the whole thing together—and that’s the story.

			Ideas, concepts, jargon, and analytical comments don’t really mean a thing. Whether the movie proceeds in a straight line, in a circle, or is fractured or splintered into little pieces, doesn’t make a bit of difference. Movies are all about story. No matter who we are, or where we live, or what generation we belong to, the singular aspects of storytelling remain the same. It’s been that way since Plato created stories out of the dancing shadows on the wall. The art of telling a story with pictures exists beyond time, culture, and language. Walk into the Elmira caves in Spain and look at the rock paintings, or into the Accademia Museum in Venice, and gaze upon those magnificent panels depicting the twelve Stations of the Cross, and you enter the grand view of visual storytelling.

			There are many filmmakers today who insist that the linear story line—where the story goes from beginning to end in a straight, narrative line—is passé, out of date, not “part of the scene” anymore. They loudly proclaim that the three-act structure is dead, no longer pertinent to the “modern movie,” whatever that means. One filmmaker even went on record to state that “the Hollywood narrative film is in its death throes right now and people are looking for something else. The whole school of Act I/Act II/Act III is destructive to a thriving, growing cinema.”

			Since Pulp Fiction first fractured the “modern” cinematic structure, there have been many films that illustrate this search for a new form: Memento (Christopher Nolan), 2046 (Kar Wai Wong), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Charlie Kaufman), and The Usual Suspects (Chris McQuarrie) are just a few examples that spring to mind. These films don’t necessarily illustrate a particular intellectual idea, like Alain Resnais did with Last Year at Marienbad or Hiroshima Mon Amour, they simply explore new challenges within the form of the three-act structure.

			Run Lola Run (Tom Tykwer) reflects this very well. The movie unfolds like a video game. Every time Lola fails to get the $100,000 to save her boyfriend, guess what? The game’s over. She goes back to the beginning and plays another game until she wins.

			Filmmakers are always searching for new ways of telling their stories: Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 (Quentin Tarantino), Being John Malkovich and Adaptation (Charlie Kaufman), The Hours (David Hare), The Matrix (Andy and Larry Wachowski), Magnolia (Paul Thomas Anderson), The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan), The English Patient (Anthony Minghella), The Royal Tenenbaums (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson), American Beauty (Alan Ball), and The Bourne Supremacy (Tony Gilroy), just to name a few, all push the form of the modern screenplay both in style and content. At first glance these films may seem to be in rebellion against the linear, narrative film, but the truth is they’re as traditional as their predecessors.

			Looking back at how the screenplay has evolved during the last twenty-five years, it’s easy to see that the form of the script has changed considerably. While screenplays like Mystic River (Brian Helgeland), Cinderella Man (Chris Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman), all three parts of The Lord of the Rings, The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont), and Sideways are all linear story lines, (that is, told from beginning to end in a “straight” story line) there has been a tendency in recent years to create a more novelistic structure. The novel’s tools, such as stream of consciousness, memories, fantasy, subjective reality, flashbacks, voiceover narration and such, are being used within the framework of the screenplay to create a new form. They’ve been doing this from the beginning of the silent film, of course.

			Often, present time merges with memories of the past like in The English Patient, Cold Mountain, or the beautiful 2046, almost a meditation on time, love, and memory. In essence, it seems we’re trying to communicate a more internal perspective and get closer to the consciousness of the characters. It is here, in the subjective reality of the character, where the past influences the present and dreams collide with reality. This fusion of time and memory is one of the indicators of what I see as an evolution in the modern screenplay.

			As of this writing, I think we’re in the middle of a screenwriting revolution, a time where screenwriters are pushing the form in new directions. The traditional way of “seeing things” has changed, and we’re looking for ways to match our experiences and incorporate the new technology at our fingertips.

			This revolution/evolution in screenwriting seems to be based upon a new visual awareness of how we see the world. Today, the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking is an integral part of our culture and cannot be ignored. Walk into any bookstore and you’ll see shelves and shelves devoted to all aspects of filmmaking. Everybody, it seems, wants to be a filmmaker. Write a script, get a digital video recorder, film the movie, upload it onto your computer, edit it with IPro Edit, or any of the other systems, add some special CGI effects, lay in a soundtrack from a database of music, and you have a film you can then email to your friends and family. Many presentations, both in business and the arts, are now given visually, either on CD or DVD. With the dramatic rise of computer technology and computer graphic imagery, along with the expanded influence of MTV, reality TV, Xbox, PlayStation, new wireless LAN and Bluetooth technology, and the enormous increase in the number of film festivals both here and abroad, I think we’re in the middle of a cinematic revolution. Already, we are making short episodic TV series for our cell phones to view during the day or project on TV. Clearly, we have evolved, and are evolving, in the way we see things.

			In terms of the screenplay, it seems we’re trying to get closer to the subjective reality of our characters in the same way that the great painters went from the objective world of landscapes and religious figures to the subjective world of the impressionists and abstract expressionism. Take a look at The Bourne Supremacy, Kill Bill: Vols. 1 and 2, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Memento, Courage Under Fire (Patrick Sheane Duncan), the remake of The Manchurian Candidate (Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris), and others.

			Why is this happening? I think part of it is due to the advancement of digital film technology, which has changed and influenced the way we see and interpret our experience. Most films coming out of Hollywood are as pretty as cotton candy. They may look like they’re about something, but there’s nothing there but sugar and water. There’s no content. As Gertrude Stein once remarked about Oakland many years ago, “there ain’t no there when you get there.”

			If you look at the way flashback was used in a film like Casablanca (Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch), measure it against the fragmented flashbacks in Ordinary People (Alvin Sargent), and compare them with the fragmented strands of memory in The Bourne Supremacy, you’ll see a visual evolution in terms of style and execution. The flashbacks in Casablanca show that magical time in Paris when Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) met and fell in love. The flashback scenes showing them in Paris are simply complete scenes that are inserted within the narrative flow of the story line. Comparing the cinematic expressions of The Bourne Supremacy and Ordinary People is an interesting exercise. In cinematic terms, the visual attributes are impressive, and the way the action and the characters are expressed makes the films more of a subjective experience.

			In Ordinary People (Alvin Sargent), the story is built around the fragments of memory that unfold during the story line. It is integrated into the story; the emotional journey of young Conrad (Timothy Hutton) reacting to his brother’s drowning is what Conrad has to uncover and accept to be free of the guilt that haunts him. The story, about a young man coming of age who must accept himself for who he is, is a powerful and universal one. The inciting incident occurs before the story begins, when the two young brothers are caught in a storm on the lake and their sailboat capsizes, and, due to the violence of the storm, the older brother lets go and drowns. Conrad’s mother, Beth Jarrett (Mary Tyler Moore), cannot forgive Conrad for being the son who lives. And it is this relationship, between mother and son, that drives the entire story.

			The drowning is seen in small fragments during the course of the film. It is seen in the opening shots, a brief sliver of the event that haunts Conrad like a bad dream. He feels so guilty about his own survival that he cannot accept the fact that he is the one who lived. Before the story begins he had so little sense of self-worth that he tried to kill himself by slashing his wrists. We learn as Conrad learns about the hidden impact that seeps through his entire being and drives his sense of unworthiness. The drowning, the key incident, is visually woven throughout the film and seems to anticipate the sheer power that time and memory plays upon the character of Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy.

			If there is any one film at this writing that seems to embody and capture this “new style” of screenwriting, it is The Bourne Supremacy. Not only is it fast-paced and exciting, but the characters are well-drawn, the story powerful, and the action sequences, directed by Paul Greengrass, are visually stunning. When I first saw it I was totally blown away; it touched me on both an emotional and physical level. I walked out of the movie theater dazed by the visual brilliance and wondering how and why the film made such a powerful impression upon me.

			So I went back to see it a second time and marveled at the way screenwriter Tony Gilroy had integrated the portrait of a character who is basically reacting throughout the entire screenplay. People are constantly trying to kill him, yet he still manages to capture the depth and essence of his character. Not only that, but Gilroy inter-cuts strands of time and memory throughout the action in a stylized, “modern” approach to screenwriting.

			Watch The Bourne Supremacy and you’ll see the shards of time and memory woven throughout the action and resolved with a moving and fitting act of redemption. With Bourne’s final act of redemption, I gained new insight on Henry James’ question: “What is character but the determination of incident and what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			Jason Bourne is a man with amnesia, driven by the universal question of “Who am I?” Imagine waking up one day and not knowing who you are or where you are. You don’t know how you got there, or even why you’re there or what it is that you do or what languages you speak or anything else about who you are. Everything in your life is literally a blank sheet of paper. In the original Robert Ludlum novels from the 1970s, Bourne is a man who is both victim and savior whose journey deals with various political and social issues of the time that are no longer relevant today. So, if you’re a screenwriter who’s going to be adapting the Bourne books where the situations are out of date and revolve around a character who has no past, an uncertain present, and perhaps no future, how do you go about creating character and story?

			That was only one of the many questions I wanted to ask screenwriter Tony Gilroy. Before talking to him, I went online and downloaded his filmography. I saw he’d been writing for several years, with credits on Dolores Claiborne (adapted from the Stephen King novel), Extreme Measures, and The Devil’s Advocate, and he also adapted Armageddon before he did Bait and Proof of Life. That’s when he got the opportunity to write The Bourne Identity.

			I tracked him down in his office in New York where he was in the process of writing the third Jason Bourne film, The Bourne Ultimatum. He shared that at that particular moment, he was in a state of confusion, still thinking things through before the story took hold and got sorted out. For me, that’s the most fun part—confusion is the first step toward clarity.

			I asked about his background. The son of writer-director Frank D. Gilroy, he grew up in upstate New York and originally started out as a musician. He played in a lot of bands, got involved in songwriting, and told me he “just got tired of playing music.” He moved to New York and began writing short stories, moved on to writing a novel, and “fell in love with writing prose.”

			When his brother, Dan, also a screenwriter, graduated from college, “he optioned a book that he was turning into a script and it looked like there was some interest in it,” Gilroy said. “I had stopped playing music, and thought, well, I’m not going to finish this novel. I’m going to write a screenplay and make some dough. Quick. Then I’ll go back and finish this book. So I spent the next 5 years tending bar while I learned how to write a screenplay and fell in love with the form of it.”

			“I learned a lot of things from music,” Gilroy continues. “I don’t read music, but making music in the recording studio and the process of recording music and rehearsing with bands and making arrangements of songs, basically just how you think about songs, seems to always be the same creative process.”

			“How did you approach adapting The Bourne Identity?” I asked, because the political situations in the book were so different then and totally out of date now. He paused for a moment, then replied that “I had to start with the character. If I were in that situation, what would I do? I mean, if I had amnesia and woke up and didn’t know who I was, or didn’t remember where I was, and I’m in a place where no one knows me, and I don’t speak the language, I could probably figure out who I was by what I know how to do.

			“So,” he continues, “we discover what Jason discovers about himself at the same time. When he comes to, his mind’s a blank—a clean slate. He’s in an environment with no frame of reference. So, you say to yourself, if this were me, what would I do? How can I figure out who I am? The only answer seemed to be, what do I know how to do? Do I know how to diaper a baby? Do I know how to fold laundry? Can I change a tire? What language do I speak? What happens if the things I discover I know how to do are repulsive? If that’s so, then that’s a movie. That was my start point.”

			We see this in the early part of The Bourne Identity. Jason is sleeping on a park bench when he’s roughly asked for his papers by two policemen. He tries to explain his situation, in German, and realizes he can speak the language. But the police are indifferent and sensing where the situation is going, Bourne doesn’t hesitate; he lashes out and quickly subdues the two cops. How does he know how to do that?

			Action is character, right?

			Bourne gradually discovers he has a tremendous capability to defend himself, along with the ability to kill people. He has knowledge of weaponry and fluency in several languages. And he learns that people are out to kill him. So he commandeers Marie (Franka Potente) and her car and they race toward safety, wherever that may be.

			When Gilroy approached The Bourne Supremacy, he confronted a much more difficult problem: not only was the book out of date, but he had moved so far from the source material in the first film that it was impossible to bridge back to even the most basic plot elements. How did he go about building and constructing a new story line?

			Tony Gilroy approached this in two ways. At the end of The Bourne Identity, Jason tracks Marie down in Greece and the film ends with them together. So, the first question Gilroy had to ask himself was, what happened to Bourne and Marie during the intervening years. “Where would they have gone?” he asks. “And what would be happening to them? I thought the honeymoon would probably be over because he had escaped without really paying the emotional price of that relationship. Being with Marie was easy so I felt there was a lot of unfinished psychological business with Jason Bourne. I was sure the audience would want to know how much he was going to remember. And we had left that open. So I wanted to define for myself what might’ve happened to them on the run.

			“First, I wanted to find a location where they would go. Bourne would be looking for a place that was ‘safe’—isolated, off the beaten track, but someplace where they might have a chance of blending in. So I started looking for places which were out of the way, where people hadn’t shot too many movies. Finally, I found Goa, in India, and I thought that was really cool.

			“Once I had the location, then I could start sketching scenes for them. Long scenes, just getting them talking to see what might happen. They’d come together so quickly, and now their time together had been on the run, with Bourne constantly looking over his shoulder, I thought they’d probably be unhappy. What would happen if the headaches had gotten worse? What happens if his paranoia has really started to wear on her? What would the reality be for a relationship like theirs?”

			That’s all he had to start with. Not much in terms of story except a character on the run who happens to have amnesia. “So, what’s going to happen?” Gilroy asks rhetorically. “As far as the story goes, I’m back to square one: What kind of a movie is this? Intuitively, I felt I didn’t want to drag Marie through this story line because I had already done that in The Bourne Identity. I thought the best thing to do would be to kill her off. That way there’d be no chance of repeating the first film.

			“But how? And why? I knew I needed something thematic, but since that wasn’t what was coming first I thought I’d follow this line and see where it led me and maybe I’d find something larger along the way. I wrote a scene where they had this huge fight—he thinks he’s seen someone following them, she’s had it with running away all the time and she doesn’t want to move again. It’s Bourne’s paranoia that led to them moving like five or six times already. And now he wants to move again. He’s on edge, jumpy, and feels he might be coming unhinged. So there’s this huge fight. She storms out of the house, down the street, angry, not looking. I had her get hit by a bus. Which apparently in India is a fairly common occurrence. She’s dead. Just like that. It was shocking and fresh and unexpected for this kind of movie. It was very energizing. His reaction to her death—his complicity in it—seemed like an interesting place to start. But that’s all it was and I was still stuck on finding a big idea.”

			How did he resolve this story issue? I asked. He replied, “In the novel, which takes place in Communist China, there was a doppelganger [a double, or mirror image of someone] impersonating Jason Bourne. I thought maybe I could use that—maybe someone is impersonating him? But why? And if I have them kill Marie and then have Bourne seeking to avenge her death, will this just become another revenge picture? If it is, what happens? I started wondering why someone would be impersonating him when he’s with Marie in Goa.

			“Around thirty pages in, I knew I needed another character, someone who’s after Bourne, so I created the Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) character. Why was she after him? That’s when I began to develop the theft in Berlin. It was at that point that I got really bummed out because I realized it would have helped if the Chris Cooper character was still alive. But I had killed him off in The Bourne Identity. If I knew then that we were going to do the sequel to Identity, I would have definitely kept Chris Cooper alive.

			“I’m still sketching here, all this is just me flopping around trying scenes, trying to get some traction to see what comes to life. After Marie’s death I had written a whole sequence where Pamela Landy’s team starts looking for Bourne. I sketched another sequence where he’s in an Indian prison and when they find him there they realize he couldn’t have been in Berlin stealing their money.”

			Gilroy paused for a moment, then continued. “But, you know, I still felt I didn’t have any big theme. I couldn’t define what the movie was about. Everything I had was jazzy, it was moving well, but I could see there was going to be a lot of trouble down the road. Everything was heading inevitably toward this being a very simple revenge picture. That’s when I knew I hadn’t really done the real work and it was going to come back and bite me in the ass. I knew we had to get on it right now.

			“So, I stopped writing. Just like that. I told everyone I really didn’t have it. I wrote Matt Damon saying I didn’t think any of us wanted to just do a revenge movie. Because that’s the way we were going. And it wasn’t going to work. And I didn’t want to resurrect Marie. There were some times where I thought maybe I shouldn’t have killed her, maybe I’ll bring her back. But the more I thought about it, the more I knew it just wasn’t going to work.

			“So I kept asking myself ‘what am I supposed to do with Jason Bourne?’ You know, he has not paid the price. He’s a guy with blood on his hands who’s made this sort of instant transformation. It’s been too easy. Can you really just wake up one morning and say, ‘Hey, I don’t remember who I am, but I’d like to start fresh thinking I’m a good person?’ He didn’t confront the issue head-on in the beginning. Which is why he’s always looking over his shoulder, constantly feeling he has to be on the run. This is why he’s so screwed up. Which is why he lost Marie. He’s being revisited by all these sins because he’s never dealt with what’s really wrong with him—and there will never be any peace for him until he works this out.

			“That’s when I realized that this movie could really be about an apology. About atonement. How can I find one specific thing he can atone for? Some kind of powerful incident. So I thought, well, who could he apologize to? That’s when I came up with the Neski assassination in Berlin. He was assigned to kill the father but when the mother shows up unannounced he has to kill her as well, and then to cover his tracks he makes it look like the mother killed the father and then killed herself. And somewhere out there there’s this kid who is now parentless because of what Bourne did.”

			I thought about this as I was studying the screenplay and I began to see that this thematic overview drives the entire narrative line of the screenplay. It is the foundation of the key incident (the killing of Neski in Berlin) that is now woven throughout the entire film. Once this key incident had been determined, it becomes the structural point to build and to anchor the rest of the film. In the end, Bourne travels to Moscow to apologize to Neski’s daughter, thus atoning for his sins.

			At this point, Gilroy said, he had to make some distinctions. First, the agents from Treadstone, the secret CIA assassination squad, were like “soldiers and their assignments were specific and precise. That was the distinction. The people that Treadstone killed were also ‘soldiers’ of some sort or another. But Neski’s wife was collateral damage. She wasn’t supposed to be there. And Bourne’s improvised solution to this—the murder-suicide—added a whole other dimension to the tragedy of it.” Gilroy continued. “I’ve known a few people who are the children of suicide and it’s a shadow that follows them always. There were, no doubt, many people that Jason Bourne could find to apologize to, but this Neski construction came about because I needed the apology to have some possibility of hope to it. It needed to be more than just, ‘I’m sorry.’

			“I wanted him to actually give something, so it wasn’t just some selfish grab for atonement. And Bourne knows that if he can find their daughter, he can at least make one thing better. And when I understood that, I jumped to the end and sketched that final scene, which came very, very quickly. It felt locked in—solid from the first pass. I knew I had the ultimate landmark to navigate the film toward. And that’s when the whole movie opened up.”

			I asked Gilroy how he structured the sequence in Berlin in terms of Bourne’s memory. I know that in my own life I’ve had similar experiences where something happened a long, long time ago and I had no recollection of the incident or, at best, only a vague, fleeting image of it. Then, one day, I would find myself in a certain, similar situation and suddenly remember a tiny piece of fragmented memory of what happened at that particular time or place. Memory stirs something buried so deep that it can be stimulated either by a situation, a line of dialogue, or even the tea leaves left at the bottom of the cup, like Marcel Proust in Remembrance of Things Past.

			The killing of Neski and his wife is the foundation of the story line. It is this journey of discovery that literally holds the film together. It is the source, the hub of the story line from which all things flow. Once Gilroy figured this out, then he began to weave certain fragments of this key incident throughout the film to jog Bourne’s memory. That’s why the fragmented dream sequence that opens The Bourne Supremacy is so important to the film.

			It opens in a dream: inside a car; rain on the windshield, the sound of windshield wipers scraping across the windows, a misty yellow light from the hotel across the street, muffled sounds, fragmented images. We watch this unfolding in a dream with splintered, abrupt visuals, just out of the reach of consciousness.

			Bourne wakes with a start and tries to clear his head. Tries to remember and cannot. Marie attempts to comfort him, but can’t. We’re in Goa, India. Then, we cut to Berlin. Night. A break-in. We don’t know exactly what’s happening as we watch two men break into an office and plant plastic explosives in the basement. The lights go out. Shots are fired. And at CIA headquarters in Langley, VA., under the command of Pamela Landy, there is chaos.

			We cut back to Goa. Marie takes the opportunity to leaf through Bourne’s journal. It is a good way of showing us what little we know about Bourne. Along with Bourne’s handwritten notations of streets, cities, various fragments, one entry stands out: “Who am I?” Which is what The Bourne Supremacy is all about.

			Bourne finishes his run along the beach in Goa and we watch the arrival of the Russian, Kirill (Karl Urban), who is hunting Bourne. And at the CIA, the names of Bourne and Treadstone have popped up and Pamela Landy is determined to find out what’s going on—after all, two of her agents have been killed. Back in Goa, Kirill spots Bourne and a wild chase ensues resulting in the death of Marie. That incident leads us to the Plot Point at the end of Act I.

			Bourne is determined to find out what’s going on and who is responsible. At this moment, it appears that this is going to be a revenge film. Bourne buries the mementos of Marie and travels to Naples, determined to find out the who and why of what’s happening. He is stopped, questioned, escapes, learns the identity of Treadstone, and, after the incident in Munich, travels to Berlin where he literally comes “face to face” with Pamela Landy. That is the Mid-Point.

			In the Second Half of Act II he discovers Abbott (Brian Cox) is responsible for planting Bourne’s fingerprints at the crime scene in Berlin. After Abbott’s confession and suicide at the end of Act II, there’s only one thing left for Bourne to do. He takes responsibility for his actions and boards the train for Moscow seeking Neski’s daughter. It is a time for redemption. After an amazing car chase through the streets of Moscow, Bourne finally finds the young woman he has sought, asks her forgiveness, and walks away.

			That’s the structure of the film. Lean, clean, and tight, with a thematic foundation that unifies the elements of time and memory within the context of a fast-paced action film. It’s an extraordinary film, a great example of moving the screenwriting craft forward in terms of craft and evolution.

			And what holds it together are two incidents: one, the inciting incident, the death of Marie. The second is the key incident, Bourne discovering what happened in Berlin and his role in it. What happened in Berlin is the underlying foundation of the script. “Once I had that scene of what happened in Berlin, then I came to work every day ready to write,” Tony Gilroy says, and from there it was an issue of infusing time and memory into a story line with skill and visual acuity.

			“When I knew what that incident was, I was thinking very practically. What kind of assassination is so special that Bourne would seek some kind of atonement? And what kind of assassination makes this one so special? Those were the questions I had to ask myself and I got the answers almost immediately. It was Bourne’s first assassination and there was no record of it at all. No one knew anything about it except Abbott and the Chris Cooper character.

			“Intuitively, I recognized that I had tapped into the two things that are really touchstones for this film. First, there are children, and they frame a strong motif through both movies; in Identity, the African dictator had his kids on the boat with him and later, when Bourne and Marie are on the run, they see the kids at the farmhouse. Every time children appear, it seems they have a large amount of power in these films. I think that will also figure prominently in the third film as well, The Bourne Ultimatum.

			“The second thing was that I had killed Marie at the beginning. Isn’t that like killing Mrs. Neski? Isn’t she as much a victim? Isn’t she collateral damage? And that’s when I knew things were working, and they were all tied together and I wasn’t forcing them. Every single second counts in a film. There isn’t one microsecond that doesn’t matter. Everything means something. All the flashbacks are there because he’s trying to recover the idea of who he is.”

			The great screenwriter Waldo Salt used to refer to the flashback as a “flashpresent,” because the character is in present time, in a particular situation, and something within that environment triggers a past memory. Gilroy agreed and added that “we didn’t want to do any flashbacks in The Bourne Identity. We tried to do the whole movie without a flashback. So, when I came up with this key incident in Supremacy, I thought this is going to be beyond a flashback. Instead, I wanted this to be where the past and present actually collide within the action. I’d written a movie called Dolores Claiborne where I’d had a chance to use just about every kind of flashback in the bag, so I wasn’t hung up about it. As I was writing I wanted to find a way to isolate each flashback on the page, so I started writing them in italics.” I told him I noticed that the first time I read the script and how impressed I was with this writing style. He calls it his “cut to” style. About midway through the second act, when Bourne has commandeered Nicky (Julia Stiles) to gain information on Treadstone and find out why they are after him, he holds a gun to Nicky’s head, “about to pull the trigger—SUDDENLY—FLASHBACK! a moment—a shard—A WOMAN’S FACE—backing away—begging—begging us—begging the camera—PLEADING FOR HER LIFE IN RUSSIAN—this awful blur of desperation and panic—fear—too fast—too panicked” and then we cut back to present time where we “Jam Back To Bourne—hesitating—stepping back—totally unprepared for the rush of images crowding into his head and before anything else can happen, we cut to” the next scene, in the building where the killing took place at the opening of the film. The script of The Bourne Supremacy is an amazing read; it moves like lightning.

			Which raises the question, when is it appropriate to use a flashback in the story line? I hear this all the time in most of my workshops and seminars around the world. When does it work best and when is it the most effective?

			Flashbacks are a tool, or device, where the screenwriter provides the reader and audience with visual information that he or she cannot incorporate into the screenplay any other way. The purpose of the flashback is simple: it is a technique that bridges time, place, and action to either reveal information about the character or move the story forward.

			Many times, a writer throws a flashback into the screenplay because he or she doesn’t know how to move the story forward any other way. Sometimes, the screenwriter decides to show something about the main character that could be better stated in dialogue, and, in that case, the flashback only draws attention to itself and becomes intrusive. That doesn’t work.

			Look at the flashback as a tool that can be used to reveal information about the character or story that you can’t reveal any other way. It can reveal emotional as well as physical information. It can reveal thoughts, memories, or dreams, like what happened in Berlin that Jason Bourne is trying to remember, or the drowning incident in Ordinary People, or the memories of the Almásy character (Ralph Fiennes) in The English Patient, or Inman (Jude Law) in Cold Mountain.

			Flashbacks are really a function of character, not story. As mentioned, Waldo Salt thought that a flashback should be thought of as a “flashpresent,” because the visual image we’re seeing is what the character is thinking and feeling at that present moment, whether it’s a memory, fantasy, event, or anything that illuminates a character’s point of view. Study The Bourne Supremacy as an ideal example of that. What we see in flashback is shown through the eyes of the character, so we’re seeing what he or she is seeing, thinking, or feeling in present time. That’s what’s happening in The Bourne Supremacy—most of the action takes place in present time with Bourne seeking to recapture and recall certain memories from his past. The flashpresent is anything we see the character thinking and feeling in the present moment, whether a thought, dream, memory, or fantasy, for time has no constraints or limits. In the mind of the main character there is no time and the flashpresent could be a particular moment in the past or present, or perhaps even the future.

			Which brings us back to the question: when is it appropriate to use or not use a flashback?

			There are no “rules” about this, of course. It really depends upon whether you’ve designed the flashback to be an integral part of the story, like The Usual Suspects, Memento, The Long Kiss Goodnight (Shane Black), Courage Under Fire, The English Patient, Ordinary People, and The Bourne Supremacy. Or, you can show an event that happened and how it happened. A flashback, remember, either moves the story forward or reveals information about the character.

			Remember that a screenplay is a story told with pictures. Dialogue only becomes an adjunct to the visual information that moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. It has the same purpose as a flashback. Suppose you want to show an event that has affected your character, and you decide to incorporate it into the script. So you go through the scene and find a nice transition point that leads into the flashback, which naturally results in cutting away from the middle of the scene to insert the flashback.

			What happens? In the case of The Bourne Supremacy it works beautifully, because Bourne is in a state of amnesia, trying to recall who he is and what happened in Berlin. It is a mystery, so we learn as he learns, reacting to the forces that are working on him in present time.

			You can use flashbacks for any number of reasons, but its primary purpose is to bridge time and place and to reveal a past emotional event or physical conflict that affects the character. Sometimes it gives insight and understanding into a character’s behavior or solves a past mystery, as in John Sayles’ Lone Star.

			There are times when a flashpresent is effective in giving a visual expression to a thought or expectation or wishful thinking—remember the scene in True Lies (James Cameron) where Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is driving in a Corvette with the used car salesman he thinks is having an affair with his wife and he busts him in the nose? It’s only wishful thinking. It’s a nice little touch. You can also use the flashback to show how or why an event happened, or maybe flashforward to an event that may or may not happen in the near future. These all are ways to incorporate the flashback into your screenplay and make it work.

			If you do decide to use a flashback, think in terms of the flashpresent; ask yourself what is your character thinking or feeling at the present moment? If you can get into your character’s head and find some thought, memory, or event which reflects on the present moment, try to show how it affects your character. That way, you have an optimal advantage. If need be, go into your character’s Circle of Being (see Chapter 7) and see what you can find.

			Some films incorporate the flashback as a bookend to their main story line, meaning they open the script with a present incident or event, then flash back to the beginning of the story, and then end it in present time. This can be very effective. Take a look at: The Bridges of Madison County (Richard LaGravenese), Sunset Boulevard (Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder), Annie Hall, Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction.

			Once you complete the preparation work on your screenplay, then you can determine how you want to write it, either in a linear or nonlinear form.

			Which brings us to the actual writing of the screenplay.

			WRITING THE SCREENPLAY





9


			Structuring Act I


			 				 					Howard: “This is not the finish line, my friends. This is the start of the race. The future is the finish line….”

				 					 						—Gary Ross

						Seabiscuit





			The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. The second hardest is figuring out the best way to write it.

			That’s what is coming up next in the screenwriting process. As we shall see, the blank sheet of paper is not only the beginning of a new journey, but also the end of a journey. We’ve gone from the necessary preparation needed to write the screenplay to actually getting ready to write the screenplay.

			Up until this point we’ve taken a three-sentence idea and expanded it into a four-page treatment focusing on dramatic structure. We’ve isolated the ending, the beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. We’ve done character biographies, defined our character’s dramatic need, determined his or her point of view and attitude and whether he or she has changed or gone through some kind of emotional transformation in life. We’ve done any required research on the subject or the historical times in which he or she lived.

			So, now what? What’s the next step in the screenwriting process?

			Structuring Act I.

			Now that we have the form of the story line, we can begin to lay out the content. Act I is a unit, or block, of dramatic action. It begins on page one and goes to the plot point at the end of Act I. It is approximately thirty pages long, and held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. We have to set up our story, introduce our characters, define their relationships, and establish the dramatic premise, what the story is about. The context, remember, is the space that holds something in place, like the space inside a glass that holds the content in place. The context doesn’t change; only the content changes.

			Act I holds the content—the characters, dialogue, locations, scenes, sequences—in place. Everything in this Act I unit of dramatic action sets up the story: the characters, the situation, the dramatic premise. That’s why Act I is so important; everything relates to setting up your story and characters. It is a unit of dramatic action that takes us from the beginning to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. It is a whole as well as a part, therefore you must “design” it carefully.

			Aristotle talks about the three unities of dramatic action: time, place, and action. So this first unit of action, Act I, establishes what the story is about and who it’s about. Seabiscuit is a good example. Here, we have a true story about four characters who are influenced by the times they live in, the Great Depression of the 1930s in America. They worked together as a team to create a story that inspired an entire nation. The first thing Gary Ross, the writer-director, had to establish was the time in which the story takes place. The story begins with a shot of the Model T Ford, and the understanding that the automobile will soon revolutionize the culture and ethics of American history. Here’s the opening description and narration from the screenplay:


				FADE IN: ON A MODEL T.

				Not so much as a car as a symbol. Over the frozen, grainy, black and white image, we HEAR the voice that has become our history…

				 					NARRATOR

					They called it the car for Everyman. Ford himself called it a car for the “great multitude.” It was functional and simple, like your sewing machine or your cast-iron stove….For the first time in history, a worker didn’t have to go to the parts—the parts came to him. Instead of building the whole car, he only had to build the bumper…or the gearshift…or the door handle….Of course, the real invention wasn’t the car—it was the assembly line that built it. Pretty soon, other businesses had borrowed the same techniques: seamstresses become button-sewers…furniture makers became knob-turners…It was the beginning and the end of imagination all at the same time.





			In this one scene, using voiceover narration along with stills, old photographs, and newsreel footage, we have sketched the times, the place, and the situation, as well as setting up the future influence of the automobile. It provides the backdrop and dramatic situation to the story and establishes the forces that will change a nation and thus set the stage for the story.

			That’s all found in the opening few pages of the screenplay. You may think that because Seabiscuit is a true story, nonfiction, that it does not follow the general rules of fiction. Not so. If you look at the opening pages of Lawrence Kasdan’s classic Body Heat, the first few words on page one describe the entire film: “Flames in a night sky.” Ned Racine (William Hurt) is established as a careless, shoddy, incompetent attorney searching for a quick score. In the first ten pages, he meets Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), then we see him searching for her, and finally he finds her. They have a drink together and she agrees to let him come back to her place (nothing’s going to happen, she insists) to see “her collection of wind chimes.”

			The sexual energy between them is strong, almost palpable, but when it’s time for him to leave, he pauses, hesitant, reluctant. He wants her. He walks to his car and stands staring at Matty, visible through the large windows that border the front door. The music swells, lust rages through him, and, unable to stop, he charges right through the glass, takes her in his arms, and in the throes of passion makes love to her on the floor.

			That whole unit of Act I is set up in the actions of the characters: they meet, he tracks her down, they have a drink, go back to her house to look at her wind chimes, and the Plot Point at the end of Act I is when they have sex. Act I is approximately a twenty- to thirty-page unit of dramatic action.

			Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter/director of Body Heat, sets up the story from the very first words of the screenplay. Body Heat is the story of lust, passion, and betrayal, and everything in Act I establishes, or sets up, the characters and the story.

			When you set out to structure Act I, the first thing you have to establish is the dramatic context. You’re setting up characters, premise, and situation. Who is the main character, what is your story about, and what is the situation, the circumstances surrounding the action? You’re building a direction here, a line of development that goes from the opening shot to Plot Point I.

			Annie Hall is a great example of this. When the script begins, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) stands facing the camera doing a standup monologue. At the very end he mentions that “Annie and I broke up and I—I still can’t get my mind around that. You know, I—I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and examining my life and trying to figure out where did the screw-up come. You know, a year ago we were…in love…” The entire film is based around that little statement. What were the “pieces of the relationship”? And where “did the screw-up come”? What we see during the film are the answers to those questions.

			What do you need to set up your story? Is it setting off on a weeklong excursion of the Santa Barbara wine country as in Sideways (Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor)? Is it Jack’s (Thomas Haden Church) impending marriage, or the effect of Miles’ (Paul Giamatti) divorce that needs to be established? Is it about Jill Clayburgh’s marriage in An Unmarried Woman? Is it establishing that E.T. has missed the spaceship home and is now stuck on an alien planet? Are you setting up a strong-willed individual like Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) in Seabiscuit, or setting up the context of Middle-Earth, Gandalf, and the Hobbits in The Lord of the Rings?

			It’s up to you to decide what you want to show, and only then can you figure out how to show it. But for right now it’s important for you to define it and describe it.

			How do you go about structuring Act I?

			First, we want to create the content in such a way that it can be anchored within the context of Act I, the Set-Up. There are several ways to do this: sitting at the computer describing each scene in a few words, or outlining various scenes on a legal pad, or laying out a beat sheet. What I caution against doing is simply creating a list of scenes they want to write in a numerical order. It may work for some people but I try to keep the writing process as open in idea and content as possible, so for me, that doesn’t work at all. It’s too limiting and there’s not much flexibility.

			I like to be flexible because I want to be able to change and manipulate the scenes I’m writing, especially in this part of the process. So I use cards to outline each scene, 3 × 5 cards to be specific, though any size will do. Over the years I’ve learned that fourteen cards work best, and if you write one scene per card (though that’s a contradiction which will be explained later), you can lay out the content of Act I, from the opening scene or sequence to the plot point at the end of Act I.

			People ask “why fourteen cards? Can’t I have twelve or sixteen or seventeen?” My response is based on my own experience—when I look at the cards, I can tell whether there’s too much material for the Act, or whether there’s not enough. If a writer is laying out the structure of Act I and has only thirteen cards it’s typically not enough to set up the material. And, if you have fifteen cards it’s usually too much material for Act I. Fourteen cards just work; it’s an effective tool for structuring Act I. If you don’t believe me, try it and see what happens.

			Now you’re ready to lay out the structure of Act I. Remember that the first definition of structure is “to build something, or put something together.” That’s what we’re doing now. Take a handful of 3 × 5 cards and start writing out the scenes that you know you want in your story, one card per scene. It doesn’t have to be in chronological order, either. Where does your story open? With your character arriving at the employer’s trailer, like Ennis in Brokeback Mountain? Or does it open with a flashback like The Bourne Supremacy? Suppose you want a continuous line of action—maybe you’ll have all three of your main characters waking up in the morning, as in The Hours? Or, maybe you’ll want to set up the character and situation like Alan Ball does in American Beauty, with Lester’s voiceover saying: “My name is Lester Burnham, I’m forty-two years old and in a year I’ll be dead. Of course, I don’t know that yet. This is the street where I live…” Maybe you want to open your script with your character at the office at the start of the day, or maybe you want to write an inciting incident (the incident that sets the story in motion; see Chapter 8 in Screenplay) where you show a crime being committed, or a murder or break-in.

			Write the idea of the opening scene on a 3 × 5 card; not the entire scene, just a few words about the scene. Free-associate. You should already know Card 1, the opening, and Card 14, Plot Point I. So you only need twelve more cards. Start throwing down ideas for the scenes you think should be in Act I. Don’t think about it too much. Use only a few words per card, no more. So many times, I’ve had students write the entire scene on the front and back side of the card and when they start writing the screenplay they simply transpose the scene from the card to the scene on the page. It doesn’t work. At this point in the process, you still want to remain open to receive any new thoughts or ideas that may spring into your awareness. Otherwise you’re going to be too self-restricting and critical in the creative process.

			Then write the next scene on another card, again using no more than a few words. Then the next card. And the next card. Do it until you feel a sense of completion about the scenes and sequences you have on the cards. For example, if your story is about an American journalist on assignment in Paris who falls in love with a young woman, has an intense and passionate affair, and then leaves for home, promising to return, your first card might read, “arrives in Paris.” The second card,” checks into hotel; calls home”; third card, “meets assignment editor”; fourth card, “briefed on his subject and assignment”; fifth card, “sees subject at official reception”; sixth card, “arrives at the Ministry of Culture”; seventh card, “interviews subject”; eighth card: “sees a person he is attracted to”; and so on, scene by scene, card by card, leading to the plot point at the end of Act I (card 14) when he “meets the young woman” he will fall in love with. If you are in doubt about whether to write down a scene on a card, do it. When in doubt, write it down. When you’ve finished, you may have ten, or twelve, or fourteen, or eighteen cards. However many cards you have on this first go-around, you’ll want to go through them until you end up with fourteen cards.

			Next, lay out the cards one by one, from the first scene to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Free-associate. What happens? What happens next? What happens then? These are magic words as they will spur new thoughts and ideas into the creative process. If need be, you may want to add a word or two of dialogue on some of the cards to help smooth out the flow of the action. Your main character should be in most of the scenes on the cards. Don’t get too specific; it’s better to be vague and general at this point as you lay out the action in broad strokes. You can do it all in fourteen cards.

			Take a look at Sideways. Card 1: Miles late to pick up Jack. Card 2: Miles driving. Card 3: Miles meets Jack’s fiancée’s family. Card 4: On the freeway to Santa Barbara. Card 5: Miles and Jack discuss their trip. Card 6: Jack on phone with fiancée. Card 7: Miles visits mother. Card 8: Dinner with mother. Card 9: Miles takes money from mother. Card 10: Miles and Jack sneak out. Card 11: Jack’s need—to get laid. Card 12: Reach Santa Rosa. Card 13: Miles teaches Jack about wine tasting. Card 14: Miles meets Maya. That’s Plot Point I.

			If you want an action sequence, simply write “chase sequence,” or “robbery sequence,” or “wedding sequence,” or “fight sequence,” or “race sequence.” You don’t need any more than that at this point in the process.

			Resist the temptation to fill out both sides of a 3 × 5 card. You don’t need to write extensive description in the scene or even include dialogue. As mentioned, this is not the time to start writing the screenplay. When you do the cards, do the cards. When you write the screenplay, write the screenplay. One’s an apple. The other is an orange.

			Screenwriting is a process; it changes constantly; it can’t be too defined or rigid. It must be left free and open, unlimited.

			Do the cards for Act I. Free-associate. Lay down your thoughts quickly. You can always change them later. When you finish (it will usually take a few hours), read the cards over and over again, smoothing out the words to read easily from one scene to the next. Change any card you want; shuffle the cards around if necessary to make the story line read better. Each card should move the story forward, step by step, scene by scene.

			Many times, people jump into writing of the first scene of the screenplay but don’t really know where they’re going. Most of the time they don’t even know where their character is coming from or going to. They’ll spend ten or twelve pages rambling, not knowing what’s wrong, only that it seems “boring and trite” and doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. They muddle their way through those first few scenes trying to latch onto some kind of direction to hop into the story line.

			The way to avoid this potential problem is by creating a back story. The back story is what happens to your main character a day, a week, or an hour before your story begins.

			You know the first scene or sequence of your screenplay. If you look at your opening scene or sequence, what happens to your main character just before that scene begins? It could be an hour before, or a day before, or a week before. Did something happen to your character that might add some emotional stress and tension to that first scene? What was it? How was your character affected? See if you can define the specific incident, episode, or event that took place. Was it an accident? An argument? Some kind of emergency? What happened? When, how, and where did it take place? And most important, what is the emotional or physical impact upon your character?

			One of my favorite film openings is Antonioni’s classic L’Eclisse (The Eclipse). The opening shot is of a large living room. The drapes are drawn, the lights are on. A man sits on a chair, resting his chin in his hand. A woman (Monica Vitti) stands idly looking at him, then turns away as if she can’t bear to look anymore. Silence, broken only by a little fan moving back and forth, back and forth, in the foreground. She wanders idly, wants to say something, stops herself, and continues looking lost and forlorn.

			A few words are spoken, then silence once again. For more than four and a half minutes, the silence continues. Only then do we realize that there is nothing more to be said. They’ve been in a relationship, it’s over, they’ve talked all night and there’s nothing left to say.

			The conversation that took place before the story began is the back story. The back story can be anything, as long as there’s some kind of emotional or dramatic aspect to it. A back story, for example, is not preparing for a date and the car won’t start and you can’t reach the person who’s expecting you. It’s not about your character going to the market shopping for groceries. I’m talking about the kind of incident, episode, or event that impacts your character so he or she enters that first scene or sequence with some kind of emotional or dramatic burden.

			Here’s an example of a back story taken from my own life. Several years ago, I had a wonderful cat named Rosie. She was then about seventeen years old and was beginning to have some serious health problems. One night, I had a very important dinner meeting. I had been looking forward to it for some time and there was a lot riding on the project for me. The producer, director, two story executives, and I were going to meet at an exclusive restaurant in Santa Monica. As I was getting ready for the meeting, I heard a strange sound and noticed Rosie having a difficult time breathing. I knew immediately she needed emergency treatment.

			I finished dressing as fast as I could, grabbed Rosie, and rushed her to the emergency hospital on the way to the restaurant. I called the restaurant and told them I would be detained for a while. When Rosie’s exam was finished, the vet told me she was in serious condition and I needed to leave her there for a twenty-four-hour medical observation.

			I walked out of the vet’s with more than a little trepidation as I rushed to the meeting in Santa Monica. Now, what do you suppose I was thinking about through most of the meeting?

			That’s the power and effect of the back story. If you have a strong back story for your character, you can start your screenplay at the very beginning, page one word one. The back story allows you to jump into the story line from the very first words on the page. So, to write an effective back story, ask yourself some basic questions. What happens to your main character a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins? Can you describe it? Articulate it? How does it affect your character, either emotionally or physically, in the first scene?

			An effective back story can influence the entire screenplay. Look at the opening sequence of The Shawshank Redemption: Andy Dufresne is sitting in a car drinking, pulls out a gun, tries to load it as he slugs down a bottle of whiskey. He gets out of the car, then staggers toward the house, gun in hand. What do you think the back story would be? Probably when he found out his wife was having an affair with a tennis pro. It’s an event that impacts the main character and sets up the inciting incident that opens the film. He intends to kill his wife and her lover and it is this scene that sets the story in motion.

			In a screenplay, you’ve got to grab the reader immediately, from page one, word one, like The Royal Tenenbaums, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, or Body Heat. You don’t have time to find out what that first scene is about; you’ve got to know what it’s about.

			Because if you don’t know, who does?

			The back story helps you jump into your script from the Fade In. It generates a strong sense of dramatic or comedic tension immediately. So what happens to your character, a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins? What incident, episode, or event is working on your character when the story begins?

			Suppose your script opens with your main character arriving at work on Monday morning. The back story might be that on Friday afternoon your character went to his or her boss and asked for a raise and the boss said no.

			Your character goes home and suffers through a long weekend. You can imagine what your character is thinking or feeling before the story begins. Then you open your script on a Monday morning as your character arrives at work. Imagine her getting off the elevator: Is she grim and tight-lipped, or jocular and carefree? Or is she wearing a cool and personable demeanor, showing her associates at work that everything is okay, but it’s only a mask because underneath that façade are the seeds of anger, resentment, and low self-worth bubbling up to the surface. And somewhere along the line they’re going to erupt.

			That’s the force of a good back story; it allows you to enter the action from page one, word one. This way, you know the purpose of the opening scene so you don’t have to go “searching” for it, trying to figure out what’s going to happen. That opening scene or sequence always seems to be the most difficult to write. Knowing your back story can help you achieve the maximum dramatic value from the very first page of the screenplay.

			One of my students was writing a story about a stage director preparing her first theatrical production off-Broadway. My student was having difficulty defining the emotional state of her main character and didn’t know where or how to open her story. Should she open at a rehearsal or opening night? Every time she sketched the opening, it was wordy, expository, filled with unnecessary dialogue and meaningless conflict.

			She didn’t know what to do. I told her to write up a back story and include something in the main character’s marriage that might influence the action of the play within the screenplay. When I asked her what the story of the play her character was directing was about, she didn’t know. Well, I said, if she didn’t know, who did?

			So she went home and wrote up a character essay about the relationship of the main character to her husband—where they met, how long they’d been married, and the emotional forces that might be working on the main character when the story begins. Then she wrote up a back story, which literally opened up the entire screenplay. What she “found” in her back story was this: the marriage was in trouble and the main character’s husband wanted to start a family, but she wasn’t ready for that step. Her career was just getting off the ground and she was afraid she would lose this opportunity. When the chance came for her to direct the off-Broadway play, she jumped at it. Her husband became jealous and resentful, and the gap between the main character and husband grew wider.

			The back story takes place about a week before the play’s opening (the opening night was Plot Point I) and she knows it’s just not working. Tense and frustrated, the director gets into “another argument” with her husband about starting a family just before the final week of rehearsals begin. Angry and upset, she storms out of the apartment and jumps onto the subway. As she makes her way uptown, she gets an insight into why the play isn’t working and understands what she has to do to fix it. She races to the theater to meet the actors in rehearsal.

			That was the back story. Now, my student opened her screenplay with the main character getting off the subway and rushing to the rehearsal with a newfound awareness.

			The back story allowed her to open her screenplay with strong dramatic tension. She was able to “leap” into her story line from the opening shot and didn’t have to search for her story in the first few scenes of the screenplay. She went from not knowing how the story opened to knowing exactly what she had to do to open it dramatically, effectively, and visually.

			If your screenplay has a “play within a play,” like a radio show, a soap opera, a play, or a movie, you must be able to describe its premise in a few sentences. That way, you can structure a progression of the story within the story to emotionally influence the main character’s dramatic need. This is especially true if you’re writing a nonlinear screenplay like The English Patient or The Hours. In The English Patient, you have two stories moving the story forward: the one in the past, the love story between Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas), and the one in the present, when Almásy is wounded and swathed in bandages. Both stories are structured linearly, from beginning to end, with parts of each interwoven into a continuous narrative line.

			That’s how the back story can help you design the first scene or sequence so you begin your screenplay from page one. What happens to your main character a day, a week, or an hour before your story begins? Remember, you’ve only got about ten pages to grab your reader.

			Sometimes you’ll discover that you like the back story so much that you want to open your screenplay with it. That’s fine, but if you do this you still need to write another back story to lead into your new opening scene with a sense of strong dramatic tension. And there are times when the writer writes one back story, likes it, then writes another one, likes that one, then writes another back story, and soon the original opening of the script becomes the Plot Point at the end of Act I. If that happens, just go with it. Structure is flexible, it’s like a tree in the wind that bends but does not break.

			So, if that happens and you decide to open your screenplay with what was once one or several back stories, just write up another back story so you’ll always know where your character is coming from. Actors do this all the time; before an actor enters a scene he has to know were he’s coming from, what the purpose of the scene is, and where they’re going when the scene is over. That’s just good preparation.

			Do the same with the back story.

			Sometimes the back story will become part of the screenplay, sometimes not. It depends on the individual script.


				THE EXERCISE

				Act I is a unit of dramatic action between twenty and thirty pages long that is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. Remember, you are setting up your story, your characters, and the relationship between the characters.

				Then structure the action of Act I on fourteen 3 × 5 cards.

				You already know the opening scene or sequence and the Plot Point at the end of Act I, so you know card number one and card fourteen. Start at the beginning of your story and move through the action leading to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Free-associate. You know where you’re going, so all you have to do is get there. Lay the story line out on cards, one scene or sequence per card, using no more than a few words on each card. When you’ve completed the cards, read them over and over again. Don’t change anything until you feel the “urge” to. Then, if you like, change a word here or there, just to make the cards read smoothly and simply. Describe the story line in broad and general strokes.

				After you’ve done the cards, write up the back story. Remember, it will influence the action of the first ten pages. Look at your opening scene. Where does it take place? Describe it. Define it.

				When the script opens, where is your character coming from? What has happened to him or her a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins?

				Just free-associate. Lay it out, regardless of grammar or punctuation or any plot holes you may have. You might also need to lay out the back story in terms of beginning, middle, and end, or even have to write up a character essay in order to feel comfortable about the back story. Do whatever needs to be done, because if you don’t know the story, who does? The back story can usually be written in a couple of pages, but if you need more, use them. It doesn’t matter how long or how short it is. The back story is a tool in the screenwriting process, one of the many that lead to a dynamic and forceful opening.

			The First Ten Pages


			 				Mrs. Mulwray (The phony): “My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.”

				 					 						—Robert Towne

						Chinatown





			During the two years or so that I headed the story department at Cinemobile Systems, I read more than two thousand screenplays and almost a hundred novels. I read so much I couldn’t see straight. There was always a large pile of scripts on my desk and no matter how fast I read I was always seventy scripts behind. Every time I thought I was caught up, my boss would walk in and tell me a new batch of submissions was coming in and that I “better hurry” if I didn’t want to fall too far behind. That meant I could expect about a hundred screenplays to arrive in the next few days.

			I looked for any excuse to avoid reading a script. If a script came in with a one-page synopsis, I read the synopsis only. If the writer told me the story when he or she submitted the script, then I read the first few pages, a page or two in the middle, and the last three. If I liked the story line, or the situation, and the way it was written, I read the whole thing; if I didn’t, I tossed it in the return file—in this case the trash can. If I had too much to eat for lunch, or if I had too much to drink, I would lean back in my chair, read the first few pages, prop it on my lap, turn off the phones, and take a ten- or fifteen-minute nap.

			My job, as I was constantly reminded, was “to find material.” And yet most of the scripts I read were not very good. Either they were derivative of other movies, or old TV series, or the initial idea was simply a one-liner, meaning the entire screenplay was only about one thing—similar to the later Analyze This (Peter Tolan, Harold Ramis, and Kenneth Lonergan), which is only about what happens in the psychiatrist’s office and the character’s reaction to that, or Four Weddings and a Funeral (Richard Curtis), which is merely a cute and clever boy-meets-girl story. More often than not, the scripts were thin, flimsy, and weak and I had seen it all before. That was the “good stuff”; the rest of the material was just poorly written.

			I began to see what Jean Renoir had pointed out to me so many times before: writing for the screen is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. To write a good screenplay, you have to tell the story in pictures, not words. As I was learning, the art of screenwriting is in finding places where silence works better than words.

			Of the more than two thousand screenplays I read, I found only forty worth submitting to our financial partners for possible production. Why so few? As a writer taking a much-needed break from screenwriting, I was curious as to what made these screenplays better than all the others I had read.

			Over the next few years, I watched as studios and producers picked up many of the scripts I had found and made them into movies. Of those forty scripts I had selected, some thirty-seven films eventually were made, including classics like The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), American Graffiti (George Lucas), Jeremiah Johnson (John Milius, Edward Anhalt, and David Rayfiel), Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (Robert Getchell), The Wind and the Lion (John Milius), and Taxi Driver (Paul Schrader), along with many others.

			What made these forty screenplays better than the other one thousand nine hundred sixty I had read? I began studying these scripts, and soon began to enlarge my own understanding about the nature and craft of screenwriting. After a while, I began to separate certain styles into specific genres: action-adventure, romantic comedy, science fiction, drama, mystery, and detective stories, and I began to explore how they were put together. I started understanding the dynamics of the sequence, a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end.

			While I was still in this observational mode, I was given the opportunity to teach a screenwriting course at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College. I had never taught any kind of a class before and the memories I had of my own teachers were not very flattering. The only effective models I had as teachers were Jean Renoir and one of my English professors at Berkeley during the ’60’s—they were teachers who sparked my desire to learn. And I remembered something Renoir had once said, that a good teacher is someone who teaches the student to see the relationship between things. Could I do that? Did I want to do that? And the bigger question: What would I teach and how would I go about doing it? The only thing I could do, I realized, was to go into my own writing and reading experience and share my observations about the craft of screenwriting.

			What did I look for as a reader? First, I noticed the style of writing—whether it was active, written in present tense, with terse, visual descriptions. The style had to be established from page one, word one. For example, here’s a brief description of a run-down building that is a good illustration of a strong, active, visual style: “Bright sun beating through holes in a rusted tin roof. The dirt floor has been dug up. A deep hole, lined with plastic sheeting has been unearthed. There’s a FOOTLOCKER open to one side.” That kind of visual description grabs my attention immediately.

			The next thing I learned is that as a reader, I have to know what the story is about in the first ten pages. What is the dramatic premise? It could be as simple as the phony Mrs. Mulwray’s line in the first few pages of Chinatown: “My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.” The answer to that question, of course, results in the uncovering of a huge water scandal and several murders.

			I also needed to know who the story is about. Who is the main character? Then I can determine whether the action and characters have been “set up” within the first few pages and a strong dramatic context established. In Chinatown, Jake Gittes is clearly the man in charge.

			The third thing that has to be established is the dramatic situation, the circumstances surrounding the action. In Chinatown, the dramatic situation is shown and talked about within the first ten pages: Los Angeles is in the middle of a severe drought and water has become a scarce commodity. Jake Gittes is a private investigator hired by the wife of a prominent man suspected of having an affair, and her husband is the head of the Water and Power Department of Los Angeles. All three things: main character, dramatic premise, and dramatic situation are related and set up the story within these first ten pages.

			It wasn’t too long before I discovered that I could tell whether or not a script was working within the first ten pages. If I didn’t know what was going on during that unit of action, I found my interest wandering and I began to look for ways to stop reading.

			You’ve only got about ten pages to grab the attention of your reader or audience. It is the screenwriter’s responsibility to set up the first ten pages of the screenplay so the essential story information is established. These first ten pages need to be designed with skill, economy, and imagination. You don’t have time to wander around searching for your story. If you haven’t involved your readers within the first ten pages, you’ve lost them. You must set up and establish three major elements in those first ten pages:

			Number one: Who is your story about—that is, who is the main character? Number two: what is the dramatic premise—what is your story about? Number three: what is the dramatic situation—the circumstances surrounding the action? In other words, what forces are working on your main character when the story begins? Once you determine how you’re going to incorporate these three elements, then you can design and structure the first ten pages as a unit, or block, of dramatic action.

What is your opening scene? Where does it take place? Is it a dialogue scene or an action scene, or simply a series of shots to establish a tone? Do you want to evoke a mood, like Cold Mountain or Gladiator (David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson)? Or do you want to establish the texture of a character, time, or place, like American Beauty, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, or Gandhi? Or do you want to set up the characters and situation like Y Tu Mamá También (Alfonso and Carlos Cuarón)? Or, maybe you want to open it with an exciting action sequence like The Matrix or The Bourne Supremacy? Do you want the opening to be loud and noisy or tense and suspenseful? Do you want a car driving through the deserted city streets at night, or a man strolling through a crowded park with a child on a beautiful Sunday afternoon?

What is your main character doing? Where is he or she coming from? What is the back story? Where is he or she going to? Think about it. Define it. Articulate it. Structure it.

			If need be, take that first scene or sequence and structure it into individual and distinct parts: the beginning, middle, and end. How? Start with a separate sheet of paper. Then, take the general line of action, like a chase or wedding sequence or just getting out of bed in the morning, and list the activities that happen at the very beginning of the scene or sequence. Remember that scenes are made up of shots and connected by two things: place and time. If you change either, you need a new scene. (If need be, see Chapters 10 and 11 in Screenplay.)

			Do the same with the middle of the scene, and the end—just list the number of activities that occur during the scene or sequence. For example, if the first scene takes place in an office, the beginning might show your character preparing for the meeting or putting together the presentation that occurs in the office. He or she might be working with an associate as they go through the material for the presentation. Or, you might show the character at home after an argument with a friend, lover, or spouse, going through the material before he or she leaves for work.

			Maybe your character is catching a flight later in the day on a business trip and we meet him as he’s packing. Maybe he has a family and we see him getting ready for his day, like the opening of American Beauty, or waking up on a morning that may have a significant impact on his life, like getting the lab results regarding a serious illness.

			The way to approach the scene is to define your character’s dramatic need. Is this a scene that is going to move the story forward or reveal aspects of the character? What is the purpose of the scene in relation to the story? Remember that we’re striving for conflict, either internal, external, or some combination of the two. What is your character doing before the scene begins and what does he do or where does he go after the scene? What happens at the beginning and end of the scene? At this point you might want to sketch in some visual aspects and details you could use in the scene.

			As an example, here is the inciting incident of an original screenplay titled After Life, a sci-fi film set three hundred years in the future in which a cosmic event sets into motion a catastrophic reaction. The main character, a recent widower, reluctantly accepts command of the mission that is forced upon him. He is the person who is best equipped to deal with the emergency. Here are the opening scenes.

				CUT INTO:



			Those are the first two pages of the screenplay. Every scene is usually about one thing—one piece of information that is needed to keep the story moving forward, or to reveal something we need to know about the main character. In screenwriting parlance, it’s called the reveal. There is a reveal in each scene—do you know what it is? Can you define it? Is it revealed through action or character? Character, remember, is who the person is in terms of their human and moral behavior; characterization is how the character expresses themselves to the world—how they dress, what kind of car they drive, where they live, their taste in art, fashion and music. It’s all an expression of who they are.

			There’s a good screenwriting tool that may help guide you when you’re writing the scene: entering late and getting out early. William Goldman, the brilliant screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Princess Bride, and numerous others, tells a story about where and when to enter a scene. Goldman sets up a hypothetical situation: a reporter is interviewing a subject for a newspaper or magazine article. The beginning shows the reporter preparing for the interview and arriving at the location; the middle has him greeting the subject, getting comfortable, taking out his or her tape recorder, and beginning the interview. The ending is concluding the interview, packing up, thanking the subject, putting on his or her coat, walking to the door, then suddenly remembering something, turning around and saying: “Oh, by the way—one last question.” That’s the beginning, middle, and end of this hypothetical scene.

			Where does the screenwriter enter the scene, Goldman asks? With the reporter arriving? Greeting the subject? The interview in progress? The answer is none of the above. The best place to enter the scene, Goldman says, is at the last possible moment, just before the reveal with the reporter asking: “Oh, one last question.” That would be the best place to enter the scene because you can omit all the unnecessary stuff that happens before and focus on what has to be revealed in the scene. Enter late and get out early.

			There’s a great little scene from Magnolia where Claudia (Melora Walters) is sitting in a bar and a guy comes up to her and says “Hey.” She says “hi.” And we cut to Claudia’s place as they “stumble into the apartment,” do a few lines of coke, and he looks at her and says “So?” and we cut to them having sex.

			It’s great screenwriting. The audience can fill in the blanks; we know what’s happening and don’t need it explained. It’s a very good example of entering late and getting out early with a beginning, middle, and end.

			As you explore your options for writing this first ten-page unit of dramatic action, do you think you’ll be able to establish the dramatic premise in this first scene? Or are you going to do it in the fifth scene? Is the premise clear enough in your mind to dramatize it? If you decide to open your script with an action sequence like The Matrix or Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Steven Spielberg), can you structure the action into a beginning, middle, and end? Or do you want it to be a series of shots like Vincent (Tom Cruise) arriving at LAX in Collateral? Or do you want to create an inciting incident to open the script, like the opening of Basic Instinct, Crimson Tide, or The Pianist (Ronald Harwood)?

			These are all creative decisions. You want to choose the most exciting part of the scene or sequence and use that as your starting point. You have to grab your reader’s attention. Do you see the first scene done in close shots or in a master shot of the entire location, like a restaurant or living room? Your intention is to create the best visual impression to make the scene or sequence work most effectively, with maximum dramatic value.

			It is essential to set up your story line immediately, from page one, word one. You have ten pages to grab the attention of your reader or audience, so you’d better design them carefully, with skill and precision.

			The opening of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens), is a good example; the first few pages set up the history of the Ring; we see it forged in the fires of Mount Doom, see the struggle of good and evil played out, then learn that it must be destroyed at its place of creation. Once this is established, we cut to Gandalf arriving at Middle-Earth and the story begins to unfold.

			The script opens with an action sequence which is the inciting incident, and hear a voiceover narration spoken by Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) wherein we introduce the history of the Ring. “It began with the forging of the Great Rings….Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest—fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And Nine…nine rings were gifted to the race of Men who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made….In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others….And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all…”

			During this opening battle for the Ring, the inciting incident occurs: the Ring is lost, then found on page 5, “by the most unlikely creature imaginable…A Hobbit—Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.” We meet the creature, Gollum, anguishing over the loss of his “precious” and we learn on page 6 that “the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.”

			In the next scene, we enter the Shire as Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives and is greeted by Frodo (Elijah Wood). He then visits Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), and on page 10, Bilbo tells Gandalf how weary he is: “I feel it in my heart,” Bilbo says. “I need a holiday—a very long holiday and I don’t expect I shall return—in fact, I mean not to.”

			Look at what we’ve learned in these first ten pages: we’ve established the history of the Ring, introduced Gollum, showed how Bilbo found the Ring, met two of the main characters (Gandalf and Frodo), and been introduced to life in the Shire as Bilbo reveals the Ring to Gandalf and tells him of his intention to disappear. We’ve set up everything we need to know to move the story forward. It is lean, clean, and tight, visually designed to grab the attention of the reader and audience. And it works marvelously. This entire unit of action, the first ten pages, is what sets up all three episodes of The Lord of the Rings.

			In American Beauty, we meet Jane (Thora Birch) and Ricky (Wes Bentley) as Jane provocatively asks Ricky if he’ll kill her father. Then we cut into a high overhead establishing shot of the street, ending at the house where Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and his family live. We see the house and hear Lester speaking in voiceover: “My name is Lester Burnham, I’m forty-two years old and in a year I’ll be dead. Of course, I don’t know that yet.” We’re introduced to Lester’s wife, his daughter, and his neighbors. In a few simple strokes we know who the main character is and what the story is about—Lester regaining his “life”—and we are prepared for the key incident, when he meets Angela (Mena Suvari) at Plot Point I, where the true story begins.

			Another good example of an opening scene is Crimson Tide. We are on the deck of an aircraft carrier, and watch as military jet planes take off, then cut to newsreel footage of Russian rebels taking over the Kremlin and threatening a nuclear strike on the United States. Then we pull back from a television screen into a birthday party for Lt. Commander Ron Hunter’s (Denzel Washington) four-year-old daughter. It is a scene that exploits the situation and reveals character. It’s a very visual sequence, and a great example of an inciting incident.

			Whether you’re writing a comedy or drama or thriller or love story makes no difference at all. The form remains constant. Annie Hall opens up with a monologue by Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) telling us that he and Annie (Diane Keaton) have ended their relationship and how he “keeps sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind….” That, really, is the whole film, since those “pieces of the relationship” are then told in flashback. It’s all set up on the first page of the screenplay.

			Larry Kasdan’s Body Heat, also a classic film noir, is another good example of setting up the story within the first ten pages. The film opens with Ned Racine (William Hurt) looking out the window at a distant fire while his one-night stand gets dressed. Racine says that it was “probably one of my clients” who started the fire. On page 3, he is in court and we learn that he is a lazy, “incompetent” attorney. The judge is irritated and tells him “the next time you come into my courtroom I hope you’ve got either a better defense or a better class of client.” On page 4, he is having lunch with his friend Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and we learn that Racine is a man who’s “searching for a quick score.” It tells us a lot about him.

			On page 6, we see him in his law office with an elderly client; Racine had sent her to a doctor who will not testify on her behalf, so he tells her he will find a “more understanding” doctor. “We’ll sue those reckless bastards dry,” he adds.

			Later, on page 7, it’s night and he’s bored. He has a drink at the bar, then wanders over to the beachfront bandstand. He listens to the music, sees Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), “this extraordinary, beautiful woman,” walking toward him. “She passes within a few inches of him….Racine’s body sways a moment as she goes by as though buffeted by some force.”

			He follows her, and during their conversation she tells him she is a married woman; he replies that she should have said, “I’m a happily married woman.” She sizes him up and says, “You’re not too smart, are you?” Then, as an afterthought, “I like that in a man.”

			He remarks that she looks “well tended,” then adds, “I need tending, but only for the night.” Racine’s the type of person, we learn, “whose dick gets him into trouble.” When Matty spills a cherry Sno-Kone on her blouse, he gets some paper towels, but when he returns she’s gone, vanished into the night.

			These pages are very good illustrations of a well-designed opening.

			You can see how important the first ten pages of the screenplay are in terms of setting up the story. They need to be conceived, designed, and executed for maximum dramatic value. If you set these pages up correctly, the story can unfold properly, with simplicity, insight, and understanding.


				THE EXERCISE

				You’ve done the preparation. You’ve clarified your story line, done your character work, structured the first act on 3 × 5 cards, written the back story, and designed the first ten pages. You’re ready to start writing this unit of dramatic action to introduce your main character, establish the dramatic premise, and create the dramatic situation.

				Look at some films to help illustrate some effective first ten pages, such as Collateral, American Beauty, The Lord of the Rings, Citizen Kane, All About Eve, Chinatown, The Bourne Supremacy, The Shawshank Redemption, and Basic Instinct. You can obtain a copy of the some of these scripts online at Web sites like: simplyscripts.com or Drew’s-Script-O-Rama.com or dailyscript.com. Or you can just Google “screenplays” and see what comes up.

				The first ten pages are probably the most difficult you’ll write. After all, you’re putting your first words down on paper, you haven’t found your own style yet, so you may experience some doubt, confusion, and uncertainty. Never mind. Just sit down and do it, and be willing to write some terrible pages.

				Don’t think about it. Do it. Jump in. Trust the process. No matter what the results, good or bad, “true art,” as Jean Renoir once told me, “is in the doing of it.”

				The very worst that can happen is that you write some terrible pages. So what? If they’re that bad, just throw them away! You’re not obligated to show them to anyone.

				If you ask yourself how good or bad your first few pages are, you don’t have to guess what the answer is. Obviously, it’s going to be bad. You will know that it’s boring, dull, trite, and ordinary, and you’ve seen it all before. That may be an accurate judgment. It may well be true. But who is it that’s making that judgment? You are.

				Let it go. It’s only a judgment; it doesn’t mean anything. “The mind,” the great Master Swami Muktananda said, “is a strange and funny thing. In the summer it longs for winter, and in the winter it longs for summer.”

				But judgments are part of the screenwriting process. Expect it, but don’t let it interfere with the experience of writing. Screenplay form should never get in the way of your screenwriting. It’s so simple it’s difficult.

				Screenwriting software like Final Draft will do the formatting for you. A good exercise might be to type up ten pages of a screenplay. Take any screenplay, open it at random, and simply type ten pages. Just copy everything on the page and familiarize yourself with the form. If you don’t have access to any screenplays, go online and download a screenplay that you like. There are many Web sites available, so just copy these 10 pages, word for word, shot by shot. You may find it an effective way to help nudge you into the screenwriting process.

				When you start writing, just lay your story line out scene by scene, shot by shot. You may find it easier to write everything in master shots: INT. RESTAURANT or EXT. PARKING LOT. Be willing to make some mistakes. You’re not going to write perfectly from page 1.

				Just tell your story.

				When I was working with Jean Renoir, he remarked that beginning a new creative project, whether it be a painting, symphony, or novel, is very much like going into a clothing store and trying on a new jacket. When you try it on the first time, it doesn’t look right or feel right. You take it in here, let it out there, alter it so it fits. When you try it on again, it looks all right, but it still feels a little tight under the arms. You shrug your shoulders to loosen it up a bit and make it a little more comfortable, “but you have to wear it awhile before you get used to it,” Renoir said.

				It’s the same principle when you’re writing a screenplay. You’ve got to get used to it.

				Be willing to try things that may not work, to write awkward, stilted, or boring dialogue. It doesn’t matter at this stage.

				Sit down and write the first ten pages of your screenplay, focusing on your main character, the dramatic premise, and the dramatic situation.

				Remember “the longest journey, begins with the first step.”

			The Second and Third Ten Pages


			 				Warden Norton: “Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.”

				 					 						—Frank Darabont

						The Shawshank Redemption





			When I first started teaching my screenwriting workshops, my students worked very hard designing and executing the first ten pages of their scripts. But when they moved into the second ten pages, it was like night and day. New characters were added, elaborate action sequences conceived, and gimmicks introduced that had absolutely nothing to do with the story line at all. It was as if they had worked so hard writing the first ten pages they didn’t know what to do in the second ten. They seemed “obligated” to create complicated scenes in order to “break free” of that opening section and let loose, regardless of whether it fit the story or not.

			The results were awful. It was all confusion and no story. The reader was lost. The story line wandered around and around in search of itself, going nowhere, with no direction.

			Nothing worked.

			Act I is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately thirty pages long and is held together with the context known as the Set-Up. It should establish the main character, the premise, and dramatic situation. It has a sense of direction and follows a specific line of narrative and character development.

			I wanted to gain some insight into what had to be done to make this particular unit of dramatic action work as a cohesive whole. So I began exploring the second ten pages of good screenplays. When I started reading scripts with this in mind, I found that in this second unit of action, we learn more about the character, who he or she is, and many times follow him or her through “a day in the life.” Film is behavior, so if we follow the character through a typical day, with the dramatic forces of the story line influencing their character and their actions, then we can begin to get a greater understanding of who they are.

			In Chinatown everything is set up in the first ten pages. Then, in the second ten pages, Jake Gittes starts the job he’s been hired to do: find out who Mr. Mulwray is having an affair with.

			What does Gittes do?

			First, on page 11, he follows Mulwray from the city’s council chambers to the Los Angeles riverbed, then trails him to the beach where, after spending most of the afternoon and night, he learns water is being dumped from the city’s reservoirs into the ocean during the middle of a drought. When it gets too late, he puts some cheap watches under the tires of Mulwray’s car and leaves. When he picks them up the next day he learns that the head of the Department of Water and Power was there until almost 3:00 A.M. The “guy’s got water on the brain,” he tells his associates. Pictures taken outside the restaurant, the Pig-n-Whistle, reveal Mulwray having a violent argument with Noah Cross (John Huston). The phone rings and Gittes learns that Mulwray has been spotted at Echo Park with “the girl.”

			“Jesus,” Gittes says, “water again.” He goes to the park, gets in a rowboat, takes pictures of Mulwray and “the little twist” he’s with, and as far as he’s concerned, the case is closed.

			The next day, he’s surprised to see the pictures he took of Mulwray and “the girl” on the front page of The Times with the headline “Department of Water and Power Blows Fuse Over Chief’s Love Nest.”

			He doesn’t know how the pictures got there.

			That’s the second ten pages of Chinatown. Action and reaction. Gittes is hired in the first ten pages, and does his job in the second ten pages. Notice how the thread of the story weaves through the action, focusing on the events leading up to the uncovering of a major water scandal.

			Once I saw how clearly defined the action was in terms of the dramatic premise, I found that to be a pretty good “rule” for the second ten pages—follow the focus of your main character. He or she should be in almost every scene in these second ten pages. If we use the first ten pages to set up and establish what and who the story is about, then the next ten-page unit of dramatic action needs to focus on who he or she is.

			In The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont), the first ten pages weave three threads of dramatic action into one sequence: Andy Dusfresne (Tim Robbins) is drinking in a car, then drunkenly loads a gun, and staggers toward a distant house. Then we see Andy on trial for killing his wife and her lover. The third thread shows his wife and her lover having sex. These three lines of action are interwoven into one narrative line of action.

			On page 7, we cut to the Shawshank Penitentiary where Red (Morgan Freeman) is once again rejected for his parole. We find out who he is, what he’s in prison for, and what his status is among the prisoner population. On page 8, Andy arrives at Shawshank to begin serving his term of two life sentences, “back to back.” On page 10, Warden Norton addresses Andy and the others by laying down the rules: “Rule number one: no blaspheming. I’ll not have the Lord’s name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you’ll figure out as you go along.” The point is illustrated when the head of the prison guards, Hadley, severely beats down one of the convicts. “Put your faith in the Lord,” Norton says. “Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.”

			That’s the first ten pages. The second ten-page unit of action begins with Andy and the other prisoners being hosed down for lice, issued clothes and blankets, and then led, naked, through the prison compound to their cells. We enter the prison with Andy, see what he sees, hear what he hears. We’re with Andy during the long first night of prison, hearing the other convicts bet on who will be the first of the new prisoners to break down.

			The next morning, on page 17, Andy meets Red and the others, and on page 19, he is assigned to the laundry room. We see a shot of him working, then cut to the showers where he is hustled by The Sisters. He tries to be polite but they are like “jackals sizing up prey.” That’s the end of the second ten pages.

			Look how tightly designed this second ten-page unit of dramatic action is. Andy is in every scene; we enter Shawshank with him, learn what he learns, see what he sees, and get a glimpse at what the rest of his life is going to look like as a convicted felon. This second unit of dramatic action shows us a “day in the life” of Andy Dufrense.

			When you approach this second ten-page unit of action, try to design the the pages with as much care and efficiency as you did the first ten pages. Lay out your cards. Do they still apply? Do you need to add any new scenes that you hadn’t thought of before? If so, put them in. Is your main character in every scene? He or she should be. Is your character active—does he or she initiate the action and respond to the premise and situation of the first ten pages? Remember Newton’s Third Law of Motion: “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.”

			This is something to really be aware of. Your main character must be active; he or she should be making the decisions about what to do or where to go. The first ten pages sets up your character, dramatic premise, and dramatic situation. The second ten pages focuses on expanding your character and his relationships and possibly seeing him in his daily routine. Your story is always moving forward with direction, a line of development that takes us to the Plot Point at the end of Act I.

			If you want to make any changes, or go off the cards, do it. Make the changes, see what happens; it may work, it may not. Sometimes, when you’re writing the pages, a new scene may pop into your head. If this happens, write the scene. This is part of the creative process. It will lead you to another scene, then another scene, and then you may wonder what comes next. Just look at your cards and you’ll see exactly the right place to continue moving your story forward.

			If you’ve made a mistake with these new scenes, it will become clear to you. The worst that can happen is that you’ll write a few scenes or pages and you’ll be able to see whether they work or not. Maybe you’ll lose a couple of days of writing. So what? Better to try something new now, than later. You’ll know within a few pages whether the changes are working or not. If they are, you may reach a point where you’re unsure as to how to proceed. Just ask yourself, “What happens next?” These are the magic words that can guide you into the next scene or scenes. If the pages don’t work, go back to where you originally started the new scenes and move forward from there.

			Add whatever scenes you need; make whatever changes you want. This is only the first words-on-paper draft and you should be willing to explore and write some really terrible pages. Do whatever you need to do to make the story line clear and concise.

			This brings us up to approximately page 20 of the screenplay. We’re now ready to approach writing the third ten pages, and that means writing Plot Point I. What is the Plot Point at the end of Act I? It could be a dramatic scene, like Louise killing the rapist Harlan in Thelma & Louise (Callie Khouri), or a dialogue scene like Andy Dufresne asking Red for the rock hammer in The Shawshank Redemption, or a simple action like Frodo and Sam leaving the safe environs of the Shire in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring as they begin their journey to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. There should be no doubt as to what the Plot Point is because the first thing you did was structure the idea and story line on the paradigm, so you already know the ending, beginning, and Plot Points I and II.

			However, it could be that your plot point has changed since you structured your idea on the paradigm. Structure is flexible, like a tree that bends in the wind but does not break. Often, the plot points will change, either sliding forward or backward along the story line, so don’t feel obligated to keep to your original idea of what Plot Point I or II might be. Do what needs to be done to serve the needs of the story.

			Once you are clear on what Plot Point I is, ask yourself what you need to do to get there. What scene or scenes do you need to write to get to Plot Point I? Usually, one or two scenes are all you need. Can you describe and articulate what story areas you need to fill so you can reach the Plot Point at the end of Act I?

			In the first ten pages of The Shawshank Redemption, we meet Andy, who is on trial, and Red, who is rejected by the parole board. On page 10, Andy arrives at Shawshank. In the second ten pages, we see life in Shawshank. That takes us to the end of page 20. Then we see Andy working in the laundry, hear Red’s voiceover talking about Andy, and in the next scene, Andy meets Red in the yard and asks him for a rock hammer. That’s Plot Point I.

			Why is their meeting Plot Point I? Because this screenplay is about the relationship between these two men. And it is this scene that establishes the nature of their friendship. That’s why it’s such an important scene, not only from perspective of their characters, but of the action as well. The purpose of the scene is to move the story forward or reveal information about the character, and this scene does both. It reveals Andy’s character when Red tells us in voiceover that “He had a quite way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn’t normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place….Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.”

			Plot Point I is “any incident, episode, or event that ‘hooks’ into the action and spins it around into another direction.” Act I is a unit of dramatic action between twenty and thirty pages long which begins at the beginning and ends at Plot Point I and is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up.

			Cinderella Man (Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman) chronicles the life of heavyweight champion James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe), who fought the German, Max Baer, for the championship. The film opens with Braddock as a promising fighter, winning his bouts convincingly (though he has a weak left hand), and providing a comfortable life for his wife and three children. Then the great Depression hits, and Braddock struggles for fights. His abilities are diminishing and in a “last chance” bout with a journeyman fighter, he breaks his hand in several places and is unable to finish the fight. As a result, his license is taken away. He cannot fight. What can he do to earn a living and provide for his family?

			That’s basically the action of the first act. Plot Point I is where Braddock breaks his hand, and loses his license to fight. The first ten pages set up his success as a fighter and his relationship with his wife. The second ten pages reveal his sense of character and who he is as a person. We see his commitment to his wife and family, his beliefs, and a strong sense of moral integrity, as when he learns his young son has stolen food. Instead of punishing him, he lectures his son that “no matter what happens we don’t steal. Not ever…If you take something, somebody else goes without.”

			That takes us up to the end of the second ten pages. Plot Point I is when Braddock breaks his hand and is suspended from fighting. So, from page 20 to the point where he breaks his hand, there are three little scenes: Braddock in the locker room prior to the fight receiving instructions from his manager/trainer Joe (Paul Giamatti). We learn that his right hand is weak and painful.

			This is followed by his long walk to the ring, and then the fight itself in which he breaks his hand. In the following scene, his license is suspended. Within these second and third ten pages the thematic threads of character and story have been set up and expanded.

			Ordinary People (Alvin Sargent) remains a classic example in terms of setting up the dramatic premise in the first ten pages, following focus on the main character in the second ten pages, and taking us to the Plot Point at the end of Act I in the third ten pages.

			The first ten pages set up the story: We meet the family, see Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) in the kitchen, observe her “neat, organized, and perfect” household. We see Conrad (Tim Hutton) in choir practice at the high school, and meet Calvin, her husband (Donald Sutherland), returning home on a commuter train. It’s like a Norman Rockwell painting, the “perfect” family. Except when Calvin leaves the train a friend says, “Cal—we’re sorry—about everything.” Strange.

			On page 5, as Beth and Calvin return home from the theater, we see Conrad (Tim Hutton) lying on his bed, and then cut to reveal fragments of images—an angry sea, a boat, a hand reaching for help—as Conrad awakes with a start. The parents return home and on page 9, Calvin asks his son: “Have you thought about calling that doctor?”

			“No,” Conrad replies.

			“The month’s up, I think we should stick to the plan,” his father continues.

			“The plan was if I needed to call him,” Conrad says.

			His father backs off. “Okay, don’t worry about it. Go to sleep.”

			Those are the first ten pages of the script. The perfect picture of ordinary people, only something’s wrong and we don’t know what.

			The second ten pages begin with Conrad waking from another nightmare, “perspiring and scared.” Conrad comes down for breakfast, and the kitchen looks great, everything clean and neat, French toast sizzling in the frying pan, a newspaper sprawled out in front of Calvin. It’s perfect except for one thing: Conrad’s not hungry. His mother, self-righteous and indignant, throws the French toast down the garbage disposal a little too fast, and the father tries to placate the two unsuccessfully.

			On page 12, Conrad is picked up by his “buddies,” but when he enters school we see he is distant and insecure. His English teacher offers him understanding and support, and says she does not want him to feel “pressured about this report.” In the next scene, page 18, Conrad reluctantly calls Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), a psychiatrist, and says, “Dr. Crawford at Hillsboro Hospital gave me your number.”

			After school, Conrad goes to swimming practice and we hear the coach urging him to try harder, but something is obviously bothering him. He seems preoccupied, tense. Then he has dinner with his parents. They have a polite dinner conversation, but Conrad says nothing.

			That’s the second ten pages, following focus on the main character. Conrad is basically in every single scene. On page 20, he suffers an anxiety attack, and leaves school. In the next shot we see him standing in front of a large building, debating about whether to go in or not. He does, and meets Dr. Berger. On the next page we learn that Conrad was in a mental hospital for four months because “I tried to off myself.” He’s only been out about a month. We learn along with Dr. Berger what’s been going on with Conrad. Now the conversation on page 9 between father and son about seeing a doctor becomes clear. We learn that Conrad’s brother Buck drowned in a sailing accident a short time ago and this has had a major impact on Conrad’s mental state.

			When the psychiatrist asks, “What do you want to change?” Conrad replies, “I want to be in control…so people can quit worrying about me.”

			The dialogue scene with Dr. Berger is the plot point at the end of Act I.

			That night, at dinner, Conrad tells his parents that he went to see Dr. Berger. His father is pleased and encouraging, while his mother is concerned and withdrawn.

			That’s the first thirty pages of Ordinary People. It sets up the entire story.

			In the first ten pages we see there’s a problem, the second ten pages defines the problem, and in the third ten pages we understand what the problem is. If we wanted to diagram it, it would look like this:





			That’s Act I, a unit, or block, of dramatic action. It goes from page 1 to the plot point at the end of Act I, and is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up.


				THE EXERCISE

				Lay out the three or four cards that make up the second ten pages of your screenplay. Follow the focus of your main character. Is he or she in every scene? If you are cutting away to another character, or incident, see if you can keep the focus on your main character. Think through the action before you start writing. See where it goes.

				Tell your story, showing what is necessary. If you’re writing a scene and something really “good” happens, something unexpected, something you hadn’t thought about before, just go with it and write it down. Don’t get in the way, just let it happen. The worst that can happen is you write some pages that don’t work. So what? Don’t save it for a later time or another scene. Write it.

				Don’t worry about not having enough to say! I tell my students that if you’re working full time and writing “on the side,” ten pages is a good solid week’s work. Think through the action for a couple of days, then sit down to write it. Think in terms of writing the script in sections, in units of dramatic action, and you’ll feel more comfortable with the process.

				If you find it more convenient, write on the weekends. Spend two hours on Saturday organizing the material and then writing some pages. Ten pages are preferable, but if you can only get down two or three, just write what you have time to write. You can complete, or polish, what you’ve written Saturday on Sunday. That’s doable and most people can handle it.

				Now write the second ten pages. Don’t spend too much time cleaning it up and “making it perfect.” The important thing is to keep moving forward, from beginning to end. Don’t go back and change something in the first ten pages because you have a better idea; it’s not going to work out for you. People who spend too much time making it “right” usually run out of gas about fifty to sixty pages in and have to shelve their material. In most cases, they drop it and never pick it up again.

				If you make any judgments or decisions about your writing, it will usually be negative. You’ll hate it. The first words-on-paper draft is usually awful anyway, so don’t worry about it. Once you get something down on paper, you can always go back and change it, clean it up, and make it better. My first draft is usually about 60 percent of what I know it can be. When I go through it a second time, I’ll bring it up to about 75 to 80 percent. In my polish draft I’ll do the best I can; 90 to 95 percent. Some days will be better than others.

				The third ten pages lead you directly into the plot point at the end of Act I. What is it? What scene or scenes do you need to take you to Plot Point I? Clearly write any transition scenes you need that will take you to Plot Point I. Have you designed your incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around into another direction (in this case Act II)?

				Can you describe it? Design Plot Point I visually. Then write it. Are you telling your story all in dialogue, or are you using visuals?

				Film is behavior. A screenplay is a story told in pictures, so think in terms of opening up your story. Show the car leaving the building and driving down the street. Show your character getting a taxi, walking into a building, and stepping into the elevator. This opens up your story, and gives it visual texture. You don’t want to write your script going from INT. scene to INT. scene to INT. scene. Open it up; take it outside!

				Just tell your story, and don’t try to tell it too quickly. Some people write their whole screenplay in the first ten pages, then have nothing left to say. Use the first words-on-paper draft as an exercise to find your voice, your visual style.

				You’re going to rewrite 70 to 80 percent of what you’ve written anyway. When you’ve completed Act II and Act III, you’ll know exactly what you have to do when you start the rewrite. Don’t worry about that now. Just write your pages. When you complete the third ten pages you’re ready to move into Act II.

				Writing is a day-by-day job, shot by shot, scene by scene, sequence by sequence, act by act. Just know that when you’re writing, some days are better than others.

				Enjoy the process.

			Finding the Mid-Point


			 				Giovanni (Marcello Mastroianni) to Valentina (Monica Vitti): “I believe now that I’m no longer capable of writing. It’s not that I don’t know what to write, but how to write it. That’s what they call a ‘crisis.’ But in my case it’s something inside me, something which is affecting my whole life.”

				 					 						—Michelangelo Antonioni

						La Notte





			When I first started teaching my screenwriting workshops, I structured each class into eight-week sessions. The first session focused on Act I; we spent four weeks preparing the material, the second four weeks actually writing it. The goal of the class was to complete Act I.

			When we completed the first eight-week session, we took a short break, then continued on into the next class. The goal in this class was to structure, design, and complete Act II.

			Many of the people kept writing during the break. They didn’t want to lose the discipline and creative energy they had built up during the first class. But when they returned to start the second act class and showed me the pages they had written, I was astonished. They were awful. There was no direction, no line of development, no trace of an organic story line, and almost no conflict.

			In my own writing experience, Act II had always been the most difficult material to get through. To face sixty blank sheets of paper can be daunting. It’s easy to go into “overwhelm” or just “check out” or simply “get lost” in the maze of your own creation. The hardest thing about writing, after all, is knowing what to write.

			What was happening to my students really showed me how not to do it. When they jumped into these blank pages of dramatic action they were overwhelmed; they didn’t know where to go or what to do. They lost their overview and did not focus on telling their story. As I was fond of saying, they were like blind men in a rainstorm—they didn’t know where they were going and they were all wet.

			Act II is a unit of dramatic action approximately sixty pages long that is held together with the dramatic context known as Confrontation. Act II begins at the end of Plot Point I and ends with the Plot Point at the end of Act II. We enter Act II by defining the main character’s dramatic need. If you know your character’s dramatic need—what the main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay—you can create obstacles to that need and then your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need.

			If you understand that conflict is what drives the narrative line of Act II forward, it becomes the key to sparking the engine of the story. Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story, whether it’s told in nonlinear form, like Cold Mountain, Kill Bill: Vols. 1 and 2, The Bourne Supremacy, American Beauty, or Pulp Fiction, or whether it’s in a linear form like King Kong, Brokeback Mountain, The Shawshank Redemption, Thelma & Louise, or Witness (Earl Wallace and Bill Kelly). Conflict, either internal or external, as mentioned in Chapter 6, takes you directly into the heart of your character. Not only does conflict reveal character but it also influences the characterization in the way he or she chooses to present himself or herself to the world.

			As stated several times earlier, all drama is conflict—without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story; and without story, you have no screenplay.

			So where do you begin when you’re approaching Act II in the screenplay? How do you get from Plot Point I to Plot Point II?

			Look at the paradigm.





			As mentioned, we enter Act II by defining your character’s dramatic need—if your character’s need has changed, it will change at Plot Point I. In Thelma & Louise, the two women set out for a weekend holiday. But, after Louise kills Harlan at Plot Point I, their need changes. No longer is it to have a good time in the mountains. It now becomes two women on the run, wanting to escape safely to Mexico. Can you define your character’s dramatic need? Has it changed since the story began? In Cold Mountain, Inman’s need was to fight in the Civil War. But at Plot Point I, he learns from Ada’s letter that she is in love with him and wants him to return to Cold Mountain. Coming home to the love of his life also represents a state of mind—Cold Mountain before the war was a place of peace, warmth, and love. Inman’s need is not only to return on the physical level, but also on the emotional level. That need drives him over three hundred miles on foot, enduring bad weather, starvation, being shot at, capture, escape, and more.

			In Chinatown, Act I sets up Jake Gittes as a detective hired by Mrs. Mulwray to find out whether her husband is having an affair. But at Plot Point I, Gittes returns to the office to find the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) who states that she did not hire him. But if she didn’t hire him, who did? That becomes Jake’s dramatic need, and that’s where Act II begins: with the search for who set him up and why. During this period of dramatic action, Gittes encounters obstacle after obstacle in the way of his finding out the answer to that question.

			Do you know your character’s dramatic need? What is the incident or event that happens at Plot Point I? Does your character’s dramatic need change? From what to what? Can you define it? Articulate it? Is it maintaining the integrity of who you truly are in a love relationship like Brokeback Mountain (Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana)? Or to kill Bill as in Kill Bill: Vols. 1 and 2? Or to find out, like Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy, what happened in Berlin?

			Where is your story going? What changes will your character be going through? What obstacles will be confronting your character? Are they a source of internal conflict, like Brokeback Mountain? Or external conflict, like King Kong or Cold Mountain or Kill Bill? If you look at Plot Point I as the true beginning of your story and you know your character’s dramatic need, you’re ready to move into the second act.

			During my early screenwriting workshops, I knew that in order to map out the action in Act II, you had to structure the action before writing it, which meant that my students had to prepare their material first. This might seem obvious, but from my students’ point of view, they didn’t want to stop to prepare the material for Act II. So they just jumped in and started writing. No wonder they were confused! When you approach writing the second act of your screenplay, the first thing you need to do is gain some control over the material. You want to know where you are going, then figure out how to get there.

			What could I do, I asked myself, to create, or organize, some kind of tool that would effectively help the writer conceive and write Act II? Something that would give the writer some kind of “control” while he or she is writing this sixty-page unit of dramatic action. (Although “control” over the material is a misnomer; like trying to hold a bundle of water.)

			As I was pondering this question, I got a phone call from an old friend of mine, Deneen Peckinpah. Deneen and I had both attended UC Berkeley and we had worked and acted together with Jean Renoir during the world premiere of his play Carola. Deneen had played the lead character, Carola, while I had played her lover, Campan, the stage manager. We had kept in touch periodically over the years but we hadn’t seen each other for a long time. She told me she was in town staying with her uncle in Malibu. Suddenly, the name Peckinpah struck a chord. Was her uncle, I asked, Sam Peckinpah? She laughed, and said yes and invited me out to the house.

			I had been a fan and admirer of Peckinpah ever since I wrote my first film review on Ride the High Country for a film magazine and a few days later I eagerly drove out to Malibu—a little too fast, a little too recklessly—but I was excited to see her again and possibly meet Sam. When I arrived, Sam was in a meeting so Deneen and I walked along the beach and talked about the changes in our lives over the last several years. During the conversation, I couldn’t help telling her how much I liked Ride the High Country, and how I wanted to write screenplays like that. She smiled and said Sam would like to hear that, especially now. I didn’t know what she meant, but I would soon find out.

			When we went back to the house, Sam was there, and we spent the afternoon together, talking mainly about film, movies, and life in general. I’d heard a lot of stories about Sam, of course, about his drunken antics, the difficulties he had on the set with his crews, his sense of “perfectionism,” and the conflicts he had with the studios and producers, so I didn’t really know what to expect when I met him in person.

			I found Sam to be likable and totally unpretentious, with a keen sensibility and understanding. He wasn’t drinking the “hard stuff,” he said, only two beers a day, and during our conversation I learned he had not made a film since Major Dundee, some four years earlier. Co-written with Oscar Saul, Dundee had been made right after Ride the High Country, and ended up being a traumatic experience for him, a “personal disaster.” It was while working on Dundee that he got the reputation of being “difficult,” meaning “unemployable” in the Hollywood vernacular. He couldn’t get any work after that and was only now being given a chance to rewrite and direct a new screenplay called The Wild Bunch.

			Over the next few weeks, I spent a lot of time in Malibu and late one afternoon, after Sam had finished his day’s writing on The Wild Bunch, we were sitting on the deck watching a glorious Malibu sunset, when I asked how he structured his stories. He paused for a moment, then told me that he liked to “hang his stories” around a centerpiece. Typically, he said, he would build the action up to a certain event, about midway through the story, then let everything else be the result of that event. When I thought about Ride the High Country I saw that this “centerpiece” event was the wedding scene in the brothel. Once he had set up the story and characters, everything led to that wedding sequence, and then the rest of the movie was the result of that sequence. That started me thinking again about what I might be able to do to make the writer’s task of writing Act II easier. Theoretically, I thought, I could build a dramatic story line, and also “hang” it around some kind of centerpiece event.

			When I thought about my students writing Act II, I wondered whether I could find some kind of incident, episode, or event, to act like a “centerpiece.” It would not only move the action forward but would also break Act II down into two separate units of dramatic action. I knew that everyone could work in thirty-page units of action. If such an incident occurred around page 60, it would break Act II into two separate thirty-page units of action. The First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II would be connected by this midpoint event.





			Intuitively, that felt right to me, and more importantly I knew it would work—that some kind of scene or sequence in the middle of Act II would anchor the material within the context of structuring and writing the action. At this point, I began looking at films from this new perspective. I had learned, through my own screenwriting experience, that the process of writing is asking yourself the right questions and then waiting for the right answers; it will be revealed when least expected. And that’s exactly what happened.

			At that time, back in the late ’70s, I was using Paul Mazursky’s An Unmarried Woman as a teaching film. So I looked at the film again, studying it, seeking some kind of insight about why the second act worked so well. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, the set-up deals with Erica’s (Jill Clayburgh) successful seventeen-year marriage. We meet her while she’s jogging with her husband, Martin (Michael Murphy), enjoys a “quickie” with him before he leaves for work, and then we see her getting her teenage daughter off to school, working part-time in an art gallery, and “hustled” by Charlie (Cliff Gorman), a painter. We see her with her friends at lunch and from all outward appearances she is happy and content. So far, so good; Act I shows us her good life and good marriage.

			Then, about twenty-five minutes in the film, she and Martin are leaving a restaurant where they’ve been planning their summer vacation when he suddenly breaks down and blurts out, “I’m in love with another woman. I want a divorce.” Plot Point I.

			From being a married woman in Act I, Erica suddenly becomes an unmarried woman in Act II. Almost overnight, she is forced to adapt to a new lifestyle, a new beginning. It’s not easy. She has trouble being alone, she has trouble with her daughter, and she hates men—all men. She goes into therapy. When a blind date makes a pass at her, she throws him out of the taxi.

			Her therapist, a woman, tells Erica she’s got to give up her anger toward men; she should experiment a little, take some risks. “I can’t tell you what to do, of course,” the therapist continues, “but I know what I would do.”

			“What?” Erica asks.

			“I would go out and get laid.”

			That happens on page 60. The next scene shows Erica at a singles bar, where she meets Charlie the painter. She returns to his studio apartment and spends the night with him. It’s not the best of experiences. From then on, all the way through to the end of Act II, when she meets Saul (Alan Bates), she explores her sexuality in a number of one-night stands. She doesn’t want a relationship. When Saul tells her he wants to see her again, she says no. “I’m experimenting…I want to know how it feels to make love with a man I’m not in love with.”

			The scene with the therapist on page 60 bridges the action between the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II. From approximately page 30 to page 60, the main character is “anti-men”; from about page 60 to page 90, she “explores her sexuality” with a series of one-night stands.

			Interesting.

			When I drew it on the paradigm here’s how it looked:





			Once again I thought about what Peckinpah had told me about the “centerpiece.” At this point, I wasn’t sure whether I was trying to force some kind of incident or event to fit my expectation, or whether my observation was a natural, intuitive moment in the storytelling process. I didn’t want to try and fit a round peg into a square hole.

			But a while later I recalled Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, Cat People, American Gigolo) telling me that when he writes a screenplay, “something happens” around page 60.

			Page 60. Like Sam Peckinpah, it seemed he would hang a story around a centerpiece. Thinking about the relationship between these three things—Sam’s statement, Paul Schrader’s conversation, and An Unmarried Woman, I wondered if the same thing happened in other screenplays as well. So I started exploring several screenplays that I had been using as teaching films such as: Annie Hall and Three Days of the Condor (Lorenzo Semple, Jr. and David Rayfiel), among others. In Annie Hall, Alvy and Annie meet at Plot Point I. The first part of Act II deals with establishing their relationship, and then, midway through the second act, they decide to move in together. Wouldn’t that be some kind of Mid-Point? I wondered. After they move in, their relationship moves to a new level.

			In Three Days of the Condor, Joseph Turner (Robert Redford), a member of a CIA “reading cell,” returns to his office after getting lunch for his colleagues and finds everyone murdered. Who did it? And why? Shocked, he seeks safety on the streets. Finally, he doesn’t know where to go or who to trust. And halfway through the Second Act, he takes Kathy (Faye Dunaway) hostage and that act begins the bonds of their relationship. In both films, these incidents happen about midway through the Second Act.

			When I drew it on the paradigm, it looked like this:





			It seemed to make sense. And the more films I saw, the more scripts I read, and the more I thought about it, I began to see there was definitely some kind of incident that occurred in the middle of Act II that could be used as an anchoring point to organize and structure the action throughout the Second Act.

			So, I called it the Mid-Point; it is some kind of incident, episode, or event that occurs around page 60, and breaks Act II into two basic units of dramatic action: the First Half of Act II, and the Second Half of Act II.

			The incident I called the Mid-Point is a plot point, yes, but more important, its function in the Second Act is to be a link in the chain of dramatic action, and to break Act II into two distinct units of dramatic action: the First Half of Act II goes from the end of Plot Point I to the Mid-Point, and the Second Half of Act II goes from the Mid-Point to Plot Point II.

			I started using the construct of the Mid-Point in my screenwriting workshops, my consultations, and in the analyzing of screenplays. I saw how beneficial it was, in terms of teaching and evaluating the screenplay. Once again, it showed me that the hardest thing about writing really is knowing what to write.

			When I began teaching the Mid-Point in my seminars and workshops, I was amazed at the results. My students suddenly had a firm grasp on Act II. In their own words they told me that they now felt as if they had some control over their material—it no longer controlled them. Now, as they were writing the material they didn’t get lost; they knew where they were going and how to get there.

			Since that time, I’ve taught thousands of screenwriting workshops, all over the world, and the power of organizing Act II into two distinct units of dramatic action (the First Half and Second Half, connected by the Mid-Point), has proven over and over again, beyond any doubt, to be functional, efficient, and liberating.

			Take a look at how it works in contemporary film. In Chapter 8, we saw how the key incident in The Bourne Supremacy structurally holds the whole film together. The Mid-Point, when Jason Bourne confronts Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), bridges the action and moves the story forward. It is the first time that Jason puts a name to a face and learns who, specifically, is after him. In King Kong (Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh), the first half of the film sets up the situation and characters, and chronicles their voyage until they reach the island at Plot Point I. That is the true beginning of the story. Midway through the Second Act, we meet the giant gorilla.

			Introducing King Kong at the Mid-Point is the incident that links the action of the First Half of Act II to the Second Half of Act II. Truly, it is a link in the chain of dramatic action. It moves the story forward and amps up the emotional and physical action in the Second Half of Act II.





			So, what’s the best way to determine the Mid-Point? Let’s do a little review. First, we started out on this journey of writing a screenplay by defining four things: the ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. So at Plot Point I, what kind of incident, episode, or event would keep the action moving forward to get us to Plot Point II? It’s essential to remember that the Mid-Point is a link in the chain of dramatic action; it connects the First Half of Act II with the Second Half of Act II. That incident is a story progression and leads us into the Second Half of Act II and keeps us on track to get to Plot Point II.

			The Mid-Point is an important structural ingredient in the second act of your screenplay. A good example is Titanic; at Plot Point I, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) saves Rose (Kate Winslet) from jumping overboard. That incident is what begins their relationship, and it’s this relationship that governs the action during the first half of Act II—they get to know each other, they confront the obstacles of Rose’s fiancé and her mother.

			As a reward for saving Rose, Jack is invited to dinner in the first-class salon. He dresses in a borrowed tux, clearly states his point of view at dinner, and little by little, they begin to share themselves with each other. As a matter of fact, we might say that the sub-dramatic theme, the context of the First Half of Act II, is getting to know each other. Illustrating that context allows you to focus on the action that takes you to the Mid-Point.

			That sub-dramatic theme is the context that drives the action forward during this portion of the screenplay. Act II is still held together with the context of Confrontation, but the First and Second Half have their own sub-dramatic theme. This sub-context of “getting to know each other” culminates in their making love in the back seat of the car in the hold of the ship. This action leads us directly to the Mid-Point: Rose and Jack are on deck when the ship hits the iceberg. This is the centerpiece of the entire screenplay; what keeps the story moving forward.

			You can see how it’s integrated together into the story line. Act I sets up the individual lives of Rose and Jack. At Plot Point I, Jack saves Rose from jumping overboard. The action of the first half of Act II is their relationship, getting to know each other as they overcome obstacles like class and situation, and leads to the culmination of their relationship when they make love. The Mid-Point is when the Titanic hits the iceberg, which now leads us into the Second Half of Act II, which deals with their safety and survival. But the story is really about Rose and Jack, set against the sinking of the Titanic, and how this relationship frees Rose from the constraints of family and society to live a life of full self-expression.

			Hitting the iceberg is the action that leads us into the Second Half of Act II and takes us to the Plot Point at the end of Act II: when Rose leaves the davit she’s on and runs back to join Jack. If she dies, she will die in the arms of her lover. The sub-dramatic theme for the Second Half of Act II could be called Rose and Jack staying together.

			That’s the importance of the Mid-Point—it connects the first half of Act II with the Second Half of Act II. The Mid-Point is the link in the chain of dramatic action.





			What is so interesting to me is that the Mid-Point not only conveys a new approach to the Second Act from a structural perspective, it also expands the character’s depth and dimension.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) meets Red (Morgan Freeman) at Plot Point I. They begin their relationship and Andy settles into his routine in prison.

			As he begins to gain the warden’s respect, he is assigned to the library, and seeks aid from the legislature for additional funds. For six years he writes one, sometimes two, letters a week, in order to raise the funds to expand the library. Action is character, right?

			Finally, when a check and a few cartons of books arrive, Andy examines the items. One of them is an album of Mozart’s opera, The Marriage of Figaro. Anxiously, he locks the doors to the warden’s office, puts the record on, and turns on the P.A. system so the strains of the aria can be heard throughout the prison. Everywhere within the prison walls the music plays, lilting and soaring with Andy’s “ecstasy and rapture.” As Red says in voiceover: “I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin’ about…I like to think they were singin’ about something so beautiful it can’t be expressed in words….I tell you those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away…and for the briefest of moments—every last man at Shawshank felt free.”

			As this is going on, the warden and guards are breaking into the office to get at Andy. As Red tells us, “Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.” But Andy doesn’t seem to mind. “Easiest time I ever did,” he tells his friends after getting out. He reminds Red and the others “that there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there’s a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope.”

			Red disagrees, because in his point of view, “Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It’s got no place here. Better get used to the idea.” This incident of Andy playing the music is the Mid-Point and drives the story forward in order to give us more insight into his character in the Second Half of Act II.

			These three elements—Plot Point I, Mid-Point, and Plot Point II are the structural foundation that holds the entire second act in place. You cannot determine the Mid-Point until you know both Plot Points I and II. The way it works is this:

			First, you decide your ending. Second, you choose your opening. Third, choose Plot Point I, and fourth, choose Plot Point II. Only then, after these four elements are placed on the paradigm, can you determine the Mid-Point. Of course, all the structural components of the screenplay are flexible, but they must be in place to guide you before you begin.

			For me, the significance of the Mid-Point is an essential aspect of gaining insight and understanding in terms of organizing and structuring Act II. This story point will assist you in designing and structuring the narrative line of action that is Act II.

			When you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm.


				THE EXERCISE

				Find a couple of movies you like and get them on DVD. Watch them two or three times. The first time, simply enjoy the film and let it wash over you.

				When you see it the second time, study it. Get a pad of paper and take notes. Isolate and define Plot Point I and Plot Point II. See if you can find the structure of Act II. Start at Plot Point I; it occurs anywhere between twenty and thirty minutes into the film. Check your watch if need be.

				After you determine Plot Point I, follow the action of the main character. Then, about fifty to sixty minutes into the film, see if you can locate the Mid-Point. Check your watch. When the film is over, see if your definition of the Mid-Point is accurate.

				Why is it the Mid-Point? Does it link the chain of dramatic action connecting the First Half of Act II with the Second Half of Act II? Then watch the movie again from start to finish. Check it out. You might even draw it on the paradigm. At that point, we can move to the next step.

			First Half, Second Half


			 				Noah Cross: “You may think you know what’s going on. But, believe me, you don’t.”

				 					 						—Robert Towne

						Chinatown





			I’ve always known that Act II is the most difficult material to write. Not only is it twice as long as Acts I and III, but the material is demanding, more complex, and requires more ingenuity and skill to execute. Just finding your story line and keeping it moving forward is a challenge. Act II is approximately a sixty-page unit of dramatic action and you always have to keep your end point in mind when you’re writing; if you know where you’re going, then you can figure out how to get there. For that to happen effectively, you must plan and craft your character’s course of action. What happens to your main character from Plot Point I to Plot Point II, either physically, mentally, or emotionally? What obstacles does he or she confront? Does your character arc change during this action and, if so, what is the change? Are the stakes high enough to keep your story interesting, suspenseful, tense, and well-paced?

			We started writing Act I as a specific unit of dramatic action. When you approach writing Act II it’s important to keep your direction moving forward. What happens in the First Half of Act II? What is your character’s dramatic need? What are the obstacles to that dramatic need? What happens, physically and emotionally, to your main character? What happens from Plot Point I to the Mid-Point? What holds it all together? That’s the first thing you have to know. Once we determine the sub-dramatic context of the First Half, then we can provide the content, the individual scenes or sequences needed to make it work.

			Context, remember, is the space inside the empty glass that holds the dramatic or comedic content in place.

			Do you know what the sub-dramatic context is in the First Half of Act II? What idea or principle holds the action in place? Can you describe it in a few words? Is it a relationship? A journey? The start of a vacation? Is it suddenly losing a job, or getting one? Or maybe it’s the beginning of a marriage or the beginning of a divorce?

			Can you define it? Articulate it. Draw it on the paradigm.

			Once you determine the sub-dramatic context for each half of Act II, you can design a line of action that executes your story line in the most dramatic fashion. That’s what dramatic context does for us: it “holds” the action, the content, in place.

			When I first started teaching the concept of the Mid-Point to my screenwriting students, I knew it was a very effective tool, but at that point I didn’t have too many explanations, or reasons, or examples of the sub-dramatic context of the First Half and Second Half.

			It was about this time that I was approached by two Belgian filmmakers, representatives of the Ministry of Dutch Culture, who asked me to teach a special screenwriting workshop in Brussels that summer. During our discussion, one of them asked if I had discovered anything new, in terms of structure, since the publication of Screenplay a few years earlier. I told him about the Mid-Point and how I was beginning to incorporate the material in my screenplays and workshops.

			Since I was taking the film and script of Chinatown with me to Brussels, he asked me what the Mid-Point of Chinatown was and how it affected the action. I told him the truth, that at this point I really didn’t know. I tried to cover my ignorance by declaring that all I had to do was open the script to page 60 and see what was there. So, we opened the script to page 60, which turned out to be the scene in which Jake Gittes talks with Evelyn Mulwray in a bar soon after her husband’s death. He takes an envelope out of his pocket, thanks her for the check she sent him, but adds that she has “shortchanged” him on the story. “I think you’re hiding something, Mrs. Mulwray,” Gittes tells her. He points to the monogram on the envelope that reads ECM. He casually asks what the C stands for.

			She stammers slightly before she answers. “C-Cross,” she says.

			“That’s your maiden name?” he asks.

			Yes.

			He thinks about it for a moment, shrugs his shoulders, and changes the subject.

			I put down the script, and he saw the confusion in my face. “Is that the Mid-Point?” the filmmaker asked. And if it is, why? I looked at him and tried to justify the scene as the Mid-Point, then gave it up because it was obvious I didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. The truth was that I didn’t know if that was the Mid-Point or not, and if it was, why. I tried to laugh it off, and quickly changed the subject.

			They left and I started preparing the workshop. I reread Chinatown and viewed the film several more times. I finally decided the Mid-Point was not the scene in the bar on page 60, but the scene right afterward, in the parking lot outside, on page 63, where Gittes tell Mrs. Mulwray that her husband “was murdered, in case you’re interested…and somebody’s dumping thousands of gallons of water out of the city reservoirs when we’re supposedly in the middle of a drought…and I goddamn near lost my nose! And I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you’re hiding something.”

			As far as I was concerned, that was “it.” I took the film and script to Brussels with me, showed the film, talked about it, referred to it in the lectures and workshops. It became a teaching film.

			Learning is being able to see the relationship between things, and the more I talked about the film the more I learned from it. (I still think it’s one of the best American screenplays written in the last thirty years.)

			One overcast Saturday morning, at the Palais des Beaux Arts, I showed the film to several European filmmakers, and after the screening we sat around and discussed it in front of a large audience. I started talking about the Mid-Point, and how it starts the connection between Hollis Mulwray, Jake Gittes, and Mrs. Mulwray. In the scene, Gittes wants some information from Yelburton, the new head of the Department of Water and Power. The secretary tells him that Yelburton is in a meeting and will be tied up indefinitely. “I’ll wait,” Gittes says. He lights up a cigarette, plops down in the chair, and makes himself at home. “I take a long lunch,” he mentions to the secretary. “All day, sometimes.”

			He starts humming to himself, and the secretary gets nervous and edgy. Then, he gets up and prowls along the wall, looking at the photographs that detail the history of the department. There are several photographs of Hollis Mulwray and a man named Noah Cross (John Huston) standing together at various construction sites.

			Cross. The name rings a bell to Gittes. He takes out Evelyn Mulwray’s envelope and looks at the monogram: ECM. He asks the secretary if Noah Cross worked for the water department. Flustered, the secretary says yes, then no. “Noah Cross owned the water department,” she tells him, “along with Mulwray.” They were partners, she explains. Mulwray felt the public should own the water but Cross didn’t agree, and they had a falling out.

			Something clicks for Gittes. Evelyn Mulwray is Noah Cross’ daughter; that means she married her father’s business partner. Whose side is Evelyn on—her father’s or her dead husband’s? Suddenly Gittes realizes that Noah Cross could have a very strong motive for killing Hollis Mulwray.

			Now things start to make sense; the information is a vital link in the dramatic action of Act II, and the first clue that points to the solution of the puzzle. Ultimately it leads to Gittes proving that Cross is the man responsible for the murders and the water scandal. It is a link in the chain of dramatic action, an essential clue to Gittes understanding of what’s going on.

			“You may think you know what’s going on,” Cross tells Gittes early on, “but you don’t.” Jake still doesn’t know who set him up or why, but he’s on the trail. That’s what makes the Mid-Point such an important story progression. It sets up the First Half of Act II by focusing on Gittes searching for information, for pieces that will help in solving the puzzle. The connection between Evelyn Mulwray, Noah Cross, and Hollis Mulwray is made at the Mid-Point and it provides the link in the chain of dramatic action between the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II. In the First Half, Gittes finds out what’s going on; in the Second Half, he finds out who’s behind it.

			When I drew it on the paradigm it looked like this:





			Once I saw that connection, the entire second act fell into place. When I looked at it, everything tied together, like the intricate weave of a sixteenth-century Belgian tapestry. That information, that connection, is the story progression that moves the story forward, step by step, incident by incident, scene by scene, leading us to the Plot Point at the end of Act II.

			Knowing the Mid-Point is an essential tool that allows you to focus your story line into a specific line of action. With it, you now have a direction, a line of development. Once you know your Mid-Point, you can structure and organize your material by establishing the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II, and the Second Half of Act II. It is an anchoring point so you can “build” your story line, confident and secure that you know where you’re going. It becomes the story progression to move your story forward into the Second Half of Act II.

			Sometimes, when you’re organizing your material for the First and Second Halves of Act II, you’ll find new scenes, new ideas, new relationships, even new characters emerging that you had never thought about. When you’re writing, you want to go with what’s working “right now.” Trust the screenwriting process. It’s larger than you are. Do what feels right. Don’t worry about what you decided a long time back.

			Stuff happens. People change. Things change.

			The only relevant question is: does it work? If it does, use it; if it doesn’t, don’t. When you’re writing and suddenly you get a new thought, or a new direction, something you hadn’t planned on or thought about, just write it down, try it out, see if it works.

			As I tell my students over and over again: when in doubt, write. If you’re not sure whether to write a scene or not, write it. The worst that can happen is that you find out it doesn’t work. You’ll learn it’s easier to cut a scene than it is to add a new one. Go ahead and write a one-hundred-seventy-five-page first words-on-paper draft. You’ll have to go back and rewrite some pages. So what? In my workshops, we make an agreement that the workshop is going to be an educational opportunity; that means the willingness to make mistakes. Try things that may not work. It’s the only way to grow and evolve, to sharpen your skills.

			To repeat, the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II are each approximately thirty pages in length. Both units of dramatic action are held together with a sub-dramatic subtext. The overall context for Act II, Confrontation, doesn’t change; that will always remain the same. No matter how long or short your script is, you will be able to vary the pages accordingly.

			What’s the best way to structure Act II? We know the three basic structural points: Plot Point I, Plot Point II, and the Mid-Point. The next thing we have to do is determine the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II—what is the main action, or story line, or concept, that holds the material together.

			In Brokeback Mountain, Act I sets up the relationship between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) as they meet and tend a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain. There, unable to restrain their physical feelings, they have sex, but deny, or mask, the emotional feelings between them. At Plot Point I, they descend the mountain and go their separate ways. Act II begins with Ennis getting married to Alma (Michelle Williams) and quickly having two children. He drifts from one job to another and his life seems to have no purpose. Jack follows the rodeo circuit and meets Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the daughter of the owner of a prosperous tractor company. They get married and have a child a short time later.

			But both men’s marriages leave much to be desired. That’s what the action of the First Half of Act II focuses on: their inability to have loving, sustaining relationships with their families. This is the sub-dramatic context. It is the line of action that holds the action together during the First and Second Halves of Act II. In the First Half of Act II of Brokeback Mountain, the sub-dramatic context is revealing their relationships. This context sets up the Mid-Point, when the two cowboys, after a long absence, get together once again, and their passion is seen by Ennis’ wife, Alma. Love becomes the force that draws them together and they return to Brokeback Mountain where they had their first times together. That’s the Mid-Point.

			What happens now? The Second Half of Act II covers several years and expands upon their unhappy marriages while the two cowboys get together a few times a year. But this is totally unsatisfying to both of them, especially Jack. We see their unhappiness; Jack strolls the Red Light district in Mexico seeking a substitute for Ennis; and Ennis, unable to enjoy his relationships with his family, runs away from intimacy. Finally, his wife gets a divorce. Ennis becomes a lonely, ornery cowboy, drifting from one job to another. He begins a relationship with a waitress who is totally taken with him but Ennis offers her nothing emotionally, and she leaves him in tears and heartbreak.

			This takes us to Plot Point II where, after twenty years, Jack is no longer able to deal with Ennis’ resistance to taking the emotional plunge to stay together. Ennis is driven by his childhood memory of being taken to see the dead, mutilated body of an older “queer” cowboy, found in a gulch. That memory is what drives him to refuse to commit to his lover, Jack.

			The context of Act III resolves this dilemma and illuminates the unhappiness of both men. This is what gives the story its power, its emotion, its universality.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, the First Half of Act II focuses on Andy’s survival (the sub-dramatic context) in prison, and his developing relationship with Red. The Second Half of Act II deals with Andy established in his prison life, and how he wants to contribute and pass on his education (the sub-dramatic context) to others.

			In Titanic, the sub-dramatic context of the First Half is Rose and Jack getting to know each other. We see that illustrated when Jack is invited to dinner in appreciation for his rescuing Rose at Plot Point I. It’s an important sequence because we see that he not only holds his own with the “upper class,” but that Rose and the others are impressed with his values and point of view. This leads directly to the Mid-Point where they make love, just before hitting the iceberg. The Second Half of Act II deals with their survival and staying together.

			The sub-dramatic context is an important cog in determining the content of these two units of dramatic action.

			Since Plot Point I is the “true beginning” of your story line, you might find that when you’re writing the First Half of Act II, there might be occasions when you lose your way in the story. If and when that does happen, just continue writing and you’ll find yourself getting back on track around the middle of the First Half of Act II.

			Defining the dramatic context puts you in a position of choice—it gives you a basis for designing the action that is needed to tell your story. That’s the function and the importance of the dramatic context. It holds everything together; it is structure.

			Think about your story line. What happens in the First Half of Act II? The Second Half? Think about it. Define it. If you choose, write a short essay on what happens just to clarify things in your own mind. Once you define the context of the First and Second Half, then you can determine the time frame of the narrative action.

			Aristotle considered time, place, and action to be the three unities that hold dramatic tragedy in place. In his Poetics he expressed the view that the time of action must correspond to the length of the play. A play of two hours could cover only two hours in the hero’s life; the time of the play became the time of the action. Unlike the writer of an epic, who could represent years of action on a many-sided canvas of mythological proportions, a playwright was limited to a single time, place, and action. We don’t see Oedipus killing his father, we hear somebody telling us about it.

			That was the way it was until the sixteenth century, when Shakespeare and his contemporaries bridged the unity of time by portraying years in a character’s life, while “[this] poor player…struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.” By dramatizing a scene here and a scene there, time was bridged, condensed, and held together by the vast spectacle of action.

			Shakespeare’s method was cinematic but placed and written for the stage. What Homer did in his epics, and Shakespeare did in his plays, is basically what George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson are doing today in their stories of myth and ritual and imagination. Epic films like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and The Matrix (Larry and Andy Wachowski) cut through space and time in whatever age you’re living.

			If you’re writing a screenplay that covers a period of time of many years, like Brokeback Mountain or The Shawshank Redemption, or a shorter time period like The Best Years of Our Lives (Robert E. Sherwood) or 48 Hours (Roger Spottiswood, Walter Hill, Larry Gross, and Steven E. de Souza) or American Beauty, what incidents can you show that will reveal the passage of time? Do you want to use subtitles? Or do you want to illustrate the passage of time by showing a scene in sunshine, and the next in snow with Christmas trees? Or maybe you have the character wearing a tank top in one scene and a fur coat in the next? Ask yourself what you don’t show. What makes “this” incident more important than “that” incident? Stories covering many years are difficult to write, and beginning screenwriters usually “scatter” the incidents like buckshot, hoping that luck, good fortune, and the muses will be with them. They usually are not.

			Planning, preparation, and persistence are the keys to writing a successful screenplay. Figure out the time frame of your story. How long a period of time does it cover? The Shawshank Redemption covers more than nineteen years; The Hours (David Hare) covers a little more than a day but in three different time periods—1923, 1951, and 2001.

			Think about it.

			If your action takes place over three hours, three days, three weeks, three months, or a three-year period, you can choose to visualize the passage of time by certain transitions to focus the narrative line into a sharp visual presentation (see more about this in The Screenwriter’s Problem Solver). If you’re adapting something—a novel, play, biography, article, or news story—you can bridge and accent time. The novel Six Days of the Condor by James Grady was changed to Three Days of the Condor in order to make it a tighter, leaner visual presentation that generates greater tension and drama.

			You may decide that Act II takes place within a two-month period. The First Half may be two weeks, the Second Half six weeks. The passage of time can be marked in several ways as mentioned: by seasonal changes, or by specific dialogue references to events like Memorial Day, Labor Day, Christmas, or Halloween, or using an event like an election, a birth, a wedding, or a funeral.

			What is the time frame that occurs during Act II? Think about the First Half of Act II: What is the time frame for your action? Decide how long or short it is. Find a workable time frame within which to operate. Trust that the story will tell you what the time period is. Don’t get too hung up with it. Don’t make it too significant or important.

			The time frame is what keeps your story in motion, moving forward from scene to scene, sequence to sequence, act to act. It supports the action, and is held together by the context.

			When you begin to outline the action for the First Half of Act II, you have the sub-dramatic context and the time frame which will hold it all together. You have a direction, a line of development that determines what happens in the action leading to the Mid-Point and from there to Plot Point II.

			The importance of sub-dramatic context and the time frame gives you greater structural support and enhances the dramatic tension by highlighting the obstacles your main character needs to overcome in order to achieve his or her dramatic need.

			When you’ve completed this for the First Half of Act II, do it for the Second Half. The two units of action are separate and independent even though they are part of the larger whole of Act II and connected by the Mid-Point.

			One of the things I discovered in my many workshops here and abroad is that to build this First and Second Half of Act II, there needs to be one major sequence that holds the material together.

			During the screenwriting workshop in Brussels, I worked with three European screenwriters, one on one, in front of a large audience of about a hundred people: filmmakers, writers, directors, actors, and many producers. The writers worked on their scripts during this particular two-week workshop. They would discuss their stories and the pages coming up, the audience would raise questions, and when the session was completed, they would go home and write pages for the next session. Then they would come in with their work, anywhere from five to ten pages, and everyone in the course would read them silently together. They were translated for me as I don’t read French or Flemish. Next, I would comment on the pages. Questions were raised and dramatic choices explained: Why is this scene better “here” than “there?” Why use the main character here and not another character? Can we change this scene to another locale, or to another act? Do we have to know what happens to the characters between the scenes? What’s the purpose of that scene?

			We began working on the material for Act II. As we started outlining and building the material from Plot Point I to the Mid-Point, I realized that all we needed was one key sequence to hold the entire First Half of Act II in place. Why? Because the dramatic context holds the story in place, but at the same time, moves it forward.





			All you need is one important sequence occurring around page 45 in the First Half, and one sequence occurring around page 75 in the Second Half to anchor the thirty-page units of action in place. That’s all you need to “hold” these pages together. In the First Half of Act II, that means you need about fifteen pages to get you to that particular sequence and after it’s written you only need about fifteen pages to get you to the Mid-Point. Same with the Second Half of Act II. From the Mid-Point to this particular sequence you need about fifteen pages and once you’ve written it, another ten to fifteen pages to take you to the Plot Point at the end of Act II. Two incidents, each one a story progression, one on approximately page 45 and one on approximately page 75, and you now have two stabilizing sequences that hold these two units of action in place.

			In Chinatown, which I was using as my teaching film, Hollis Mulwray’s murder is discovered on page 45 and is enough to move the story forward to the Mid-Point. The event which is the Mid-Point (the connection between Evelyn, Cross, and Mulwray) is enough of a story progression to move the story forward to the point where Gittes discovers that all the land in the Northeast Valley has been sold to people who are dead or people who are in retirement homes. That story progression moves the story forward as Gittes discovers that Noah Cross is responsible for the murders as well as the water scandal.

			During the remainder of the Brussels workshop I advised my screenwriters to organize their First Half material around this one sequence, at approximately page 45, and another sequence which occurs around page 75. Both sequences are story progression points and their function is to simply keep the story on track. The writers loved working with these scenes. They could build up to them, execute them, then move toward the Mid-Point. I’ve learned that this one sequence can be an action sequence, a dialogue sequence, or anything you want it to be as long as it moves the story forward.

			The screenwriters told me that I needed to identify these two story progression points, so when I returned from my workshops abroad I started using these two sequences and my students immediately confirmed their importance. They told me it was the most important element in writing Act II.

			I decided to call these two sequences Pinch I, in the First Half of Act II, and Pinch II for the Second Half of Act II. I thought labeling them as Pinch I and Pinch II was appropriate because these sequences simply “pinch” the story line together to keep your story on track. That is their function.

			The definition of a Pinch is simple: it is a sequence that keeps the action moving forward to the Mid-Point, or to Plot Point II. It is just a little pinch in the story line that keeps the action on track, moving the story forward either to the Mid-Point or Plot Point II. Yes, it is a Plot Point, but more important, it is a sequence the keeps the story on track and moving forward.





			Sometimes there’s a relationship between Pinch I and Pinch II, some kind of story connection. In Thelma & Louise, at Pinch I the two girls pick up J.D. (Brad Pitt), only to have him steal their money at the Mid-Point. Pinch II occurs when J.D. is picked up by the police and tells them that Thelma and Louise are heading to Mexico. This kind of symmetry doesn’t happen all the time; it really depends upon your story line and situation.

			The more I use Pinch I and Pinch II as an anchoring sequence in the structuring of Act II, the more valuable I find them. When you approach structuring Act II, you build the story line in units of dramatic action; we build the First Half of Act II, then the Second Half of Act II. As mentioned, first we determine the Mid-Point, then establish the sub-dramatic context of the First Half, then the sub-dramatic context of the Second Half. Only when you have the context of this unit of action can you determine Pinch I. What is the incident, episode, or event that keeps the story on track?

			Once you establish that, you can move forward into the Second Half of Act II. You know the Mid-Point and you know Plot Point II. What is the theme of action that keeps the story moving forward to Plot Point II? That’s your sub-dramatic context. Write it down on the paradigm. Next, determine Pinch II, that sequence that keeps the story on track heading toward Plot Point II.

			Now, the nice thing about structure is that it’s flexible. We can always move these structural points up and down, or forward and backward, on the paradigm. We always have to keep in mind that this is just the starting point, not the end point.

			Once you’ve structured these points on the paradigm, we’re ready to begin structuring Act II. We’re going to start with the First Half of Act II. Take fourteen cards, just the way we did in Chapter 9, and lay out the action the same way you did for Act I. To repeat, before you lay out your fourteen cards for the First Half of Act II, you must have established your Mid-Point, determined the sub-dramatic context, and established Pinch I. Now, lay out these fourteen cards, using free-association, for the First Half. Just throw them down. Now, what card do you think Pinch I will be? Card number 7. Why? Because it occurs about halfway through the First Half of Act II, approximately page 45.

			Go over and over the cards until they feel comfortable. Remember that the essence of Act II is conflict, so seek out those conflicts, either internal or external, whenever and wherever you can. And remember, the purpose of each scene is to either move the story forward or reveal information about the character.

			If you get lost somewhere in the creative maze that is Act II, you could spend days, perhaps weeks, in frustration and despair trying to find your way out of the pit. But as you’re writing Act II, you have to understand that you have no objectivity at all. If you doubt yourself in terms or the material, you’ll start censoring everything, and you won’t be able to write anything! If you don’t watch out, that’s when you’ll become your own victim and start to experience writer’s block. Don’t let that happen.

			Keep writing no matter how you feel about it, whether you think it’s good, bad, or indifferent. Just write your story, page by page, scene by scene, shot by shot, and leave all your judgments and evaluations in the nightstand drawer next to your bed.

			Breaking Act II into the First and Second Half, then establishing the sub-dramatic context and time frame, then Pinch I and Pinch II, allows you to gain a structural overview that keeps your story on track. It will guide you through the obstacle course that leads to the next step in the screenwriting process—the actual writing of Act II.





				THE EXERCISE

				Let’s do the following exercise as a “tune-up.”

				Look at the paradigm (on the previous page): we have a story about a young woman in an unhappy marriage who enrolls in an art class and ends up having an affair with her teacher.

				The way it’s broken down and structured is the same way we structure all our exercises: we choose the ending first, the beginning next, then Plot Points I and II, then the Mid-Point, then the time frame, then we establish the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II, than the sub-dramatic context for the Second Half, and only then do we determine Pinches I and II.

				In Act I, we set up our story by establishing the unhappy marriage of our main character. Plot Point I is when she enrolls in the art class.

				Since we know she’s going to have an affair with the teacher, and become pregnant at Plot Point II, the Mid-Point would be when she has sex with him for the first time. In that way, the First Half is where we see her juggling her art class, her painting, and her marriage, as well as her feelings about herself as she gets to know the teacher. The sub-dramatic context of this First Half of Act II would focus on establishing the relationship between her and her teacher. The sub-dramatic context of the Second Half of Act II deals with her falling in love with her teacher.

				Take another look at it on the paradigm.

				Go over the action. What incident, episode, or event do you think Pinch I is?

				Let’s look at the possibilities: It might be where the young woman and the teacher have an opportunity to get to know each other for the first time on a one-to-one basis. Maybe she wants an appraisal of her work and they go out for coffee after class; or her car won’t start in the parking lot and she borrows his cell phone; or he gives her a ride home and they decide they like each other; or they meet at a party. Any such situation will work as Pinch I.

				Our character is not about to jump right into bed with her teacher, no matter how unhappy she might be with her husband. She is cautious, and her actions will be appropriate to the circumstances. Otherwise, we don’t have any sympathy for her, and your main character must always be sympathetic. And what about the teacher? Who is he? What kind of person is he? You would do a character biography on him just to see what kind of a person he is. Student and teacher would spend time together getting to know each other, which we could show, and then, at Mid-Point, they have sex for the first time. That gives you about fifteen pages of script to visually reveal their relationship.

				During the Second Half of Act II the student falls in love with the teacher, leading us to Plot Point II, where she discovers she’s pregnant. It could be a scene in a doctor’s office, or the results of a pregnancy test. If they have an intense and passionate scene making love, this might be the scene where she conceives.

				In this scenario, what scene do you think Pinch II is? Think about it. Study the paradigm. Write down a few ideas.

				Going to the doctor’s office

				Having a fight with her husband

				Getting into an argument with the teacher

				Leaving her husband

				Telling the teacher she loves him

				Learning the teacher has a wife

				A weekend trip where they make love and she conceives

				Any one of these sequences will work effectively. What do you think?

				I know what I would do: Pinch II would be where she first misses her period. That incident sets up choices: is she pregnant? Finding out leads her to her choices: have an abortion; tell her husband about it; leave her husband; leave both husband and lover and have the baby on her own and start life over again as a single person, mother, and painter. Or, does she want to start a new life with the teacher? In other words, how does she resolve her dilemma in Act III?

				You don’t have to use my ending. You may have a different one. All the dramatic choices listed above can work. The right one is the one that works for you.

				If it works, use it; if it doesn’t, don’t. That’s the rule. Try it. If it doesn’t work, see what does work. Don’t be afraid to make some mistakes. When you are writing a screenplay you’ve got to be open and receptive to all those little “accidents” that mysteriously happen on the blank sheet of paper.

				Don’t get too hung up on what you want to happen; let it happen. Screenwriting is a process, it continually changes and endures.

				That’s the real joy of writing.

			Writing Act II


			 				“The idea emerges and once it gets to the writing stage, all the work’s been done. It’s really all the pre-work that’s the real heavy work. Once you get to the point where you sit at the typewriter [computer] all the hard work is over and it’s really just getting it down, which is no problem at all.”

				 					 						—Woody Allen





			As mentioned earlier, the best and most effective way to enter Act II is from your character’s dramatic need. It’s important to redefine what your main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay. What is it that drives him or her through the action to bring a resolution to whatever crisis or situation, either emotional or physical, your character finds himself in? Can you define it? Articulate it?

			Has your character’s dramatic need changed at Plot Point I? Remember, if your character’s dramatic need changes, it will change at Plot Point I. That is the true beginning of your story.

			During the preparation of Act II, did you think about what obstacles your character might confront during this course of narrative action? Preparing to write Act II means that you need to know approximately four major obstacles that your character confronts to get through the story line. As with all obstacles, they can either be internal or external, physical or emotional, mental or spiritual.

			The foundation of all good writing is conflict. Stating it once again, all drama is conflict; without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story. And without story you have no screenplay. Films like: The Hours, Chinatown, The Manchurian Candidate, A Place in the Sun (Michael Wilson and Harry Brown), Cold Mountain, and American Beauty have both internal and external conflict.

			External conflict is where the conflict is outside the character, and the characters face physical (and in some part, emotional, of course) obstacles, such as in Cold Mountain, Collateral, Apollo 13, and Jurassic Park (Michael Crichton and David Koepp). Creating conflict within the story through characters and events is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.

			So what is conflict? If you look at the word it means to be “in opposition to,” and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character(s) be in opposition to someone or something. Conflict can be anything, a struggle, a quarrel, a battle, or a chase scene, fear of life, fear of failure or success, internal or external, any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental. If you do not have enough conflict, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in a quagmire of dull writing.

			Conflict can be expressed either physically or emotionally. You can talk about it through dialogue, or you can express it through physical acts, or you can have your character respond to it. Conflict, no matter what form it takes, becomes the engine that drives the story line through the second act.

			Remember too that dialogue is a function of character. Let’s review its purpose. Dialogue:

			• moves the story forward

			• reveals information about the character (after all, they do have a history)

			• communicates necessary facts and information to the reader

			• establishes character relationships; makes them real, natural, and spontaneous

			• gives your characters depth, insight, and purpose

			• reveals the conflicts of the story and characters

			• reveals the emotional states of your characters

			• comments on the action

			Your first attempts at writing dialogue in Act II will probably be unnatural, clichéd, fragmented, and strained. Writing dialogue is like learning to swim; you’re going to flounder around a bit, but the more you do the easier it gets. When you enter the First Half of Act II it may take you several pages to get into a rhythm of both story and dialogue.

			Don’t worry about it. It takes anywhere from forty to fifty pages before your characters start talking to you. And they do start talking to you. Just let it be okay to write shitty pages, with stilted, direct, dumb, and obvious dialogue. Keep writing. Dialogue can always be cleaned up during the rewrite. “Writing is rewriting” is the ancient adage.

			A word to those of you who are looking for “inspiration” to guide you during this process; sorry to say it but you’re probably not going to find it. Inspiration is measured in moments, a few minutes, or hours. A screenplay depends on diligence and discipline and is measured in weeks and months. If it takes you a hundred days to write a screenplay and you’re “on” for ten of those days, consider yourself lucky. Being “on” for one hundred days, or twenty-five days, just doesn’t happen. Especially writing Act II. You may “hear” that it does, but in truth it’s the pot at the end of the rainbow—you’re chasing a dream.

			“But…” you say.

			But what? You mean, those stories, rumors, or hearsay that tells you that so and so wrote his or her screenplay that sold for millions in a week or two? Or, the second cousin of a friend of a friend’s friend knows someone who wrote the entire screenplay in two days? Is that what that “but” refers to?

			Forget it. Writing, as I tell everyone who’s even thinking about writing a screenplay, is a day-by-day job, two to three hours a day, five or six days a week, either during the day or on weekends, three or more pages a day, ten pages or more a week. Shot by shot, scene by scene, sequence by sequence, page by page, act by act. And some days are better than others.

			Just remember that when you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm.

			Even though the card system is your map and your guide, the Plot Points, Mid-Point, sub-dramatic context, and Pinches I and II are your checkpoints along the way, the “last-chance” gas station before you hit the high desert which is the ending—your destination.

			What’s nice about the card system is that once it’s done you can forget it. But at this stage, where we’re writing Act II, we’re going to use the cards to build the First and Second Halves of Act II.

			In review, one card equals one scene, but when you’re writing the screenplay, that is a contradiction. As you’re writing Act II, you’ll suddenly “discover” a new scene that you hadn’t even thought about, or a scene that simply works better than what you put down on the cards. If you’re in doubt about whether to use it or not use it, use it. That scene will lead you to veer off the path of the cards into a few new scenes or sequences that you hadn’t even considered. I think that’s great. Do it. Write it. Pinches I and II and the Mid-Point will be your structural guidelines, keeping you on the path of your story. If that happens, just go with it because it’s important to write those scenes or sequences. You can tell within a few pages whether they are working or not. You’ll finish these new pages, feeling satisfied with your efforts, but then a sudden question might hit you: what happens next? And, you don’t have a clue, you don’t know what to do, or where to go. Take a breath and just look at the next card. You’ll find you have a perfect lead-in to the next scene you have organized on the cards. And if those new scenes don’t work, just know that all you’ve lost is a couple of days, but you’ve maintained your creative energy. In reality, you haven’t lost anything. Your creative mind has assimilated those new scenes so you can throw out what you thought might work and still be following the direction of your story.

			Remember, when you’re doing the cards, you’re doing the cards. When you’re writing the screenplay, you’re writing the screenplay. Forget rigid adherence to the cards. Let them guide you; don’t be a slave to them. What’s the point? If you ever feel a spontaneous moment that gives you a better, more fluid story, write it.

			As you’re laying out the scenes, you’ll find once again that the actual writing experience differs from the way you laid out the cards. Don’t worry about changing the cards to fit the story, or adding new things in the development of the story and characters. At this point, you should be starting to feel comfortable with the form.

			Begin Act II by designing the opening scene or sequence. You have your character’s dramatic need clearly in focus. Now you can think about where to enter the scene. Think about entering late and getting out early. That is, try to enter the scene at the last possible moment just before the major “reveal” is established. “Reveal” is what the scene is all about; either it moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. Each scene should be about one thing, should have one “beat” to it. Do you know what the purpose of the scene is? Where did your character come from? Where is he or she going to? Did you have to change his or her dramatic need? What about the conflict within the scene? Is it internal, or external? What is the obstacle that keeps your character from achieving his or her dramatic need? If you don’t know, who does?

			How are you going to enter the scene? At the beginning? In the middle? Or, right at the end. Most of the time you’ll enter the scene right before the purpose of the scene is revealed. As you’re sketching in the context, it may help you to find the elements, or components, of the action. Does the scene you’re writing fall into the space of the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II? For example, if your context is a young woman—an artist—in an unhappy marriage, fill in and dramatize the context of her relationship with her husband. Do the same with her painting, with her friend(s), and with herself. These four elements can fill an entire thirty-page unit of action.

			Make the story line clean and simple; don’t clutter it up with too many details or too many twists and turns of plot. Once again, screenwriting is telling a story with pictures, of finding places where silence works better than words. And, to repeat once again, the purpose of each scene is to either move the story forward or reveal information about the character.

			Write the first ten pages of the Second Half. Just tell your story, don’t worry about frills or gimmicks. Make sure you are clear on your dramatic context and time frame. Again, work in ten-page units, moving the action forward through Pinch II to the plot point at the end of Act II. If you want to clean up your ten-page sections, do it. Then move on. Always move forward from beginning to end, beginning to end. Don’t spend time rewriting now. You’ll do that later.

			If need be, reread Chapter 10 of Screenplay, “The Scene.” If a new scene springs out of the page, write it down. If you find that you’re leaving the action you wrote on the cards and you feel you want to follow this new direction, do it. The worst that can happen is you write a few scenes and realize they don’t work. No problem. Just go back and pick up the story where you left off. What you try that doesn’t work will always show you what does work; mistakes and changes are part of the writing experience. I don’t know why it happens or how it happens—all I know is that it does happen. It’s the writing process; it’s larger than we are.

			Be clean and tight; don’t clog up the action with a lot of description or dialogue, or new plot twists and surprises. The context is confrontation; your character is confronting obstacles that keep him or her from achieving his or her dramatic need.

			After you complete the first ten pages of the First Half of Act II, move into the second ten pages. You’re heading toward Pinch I, so design these second ten pages carefully. Your cards may be a great help to you here, or not. In my own screenplays, when I’m writing this unit of action I always let my creative impulse guide my direction. Since I have my structure in place, I don’t worry about whether I’m doing something that may not work, or may not be able to change.

			Do you know what scenes you have to write before you get to Pinch I? Describe them. Define them. Then write them. Follow your story line. Or, follow the new story line that seems to be emerging on the pages. I’ve found that when I’m writing the First Half of Act II, they always seem to be the most difficult pages. I think this happens because you have to rediscover your story. If Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story, how do we begin to keep the story on track with tension, pacing, and suspense? It’s like starting over again, from the beginning, only this time it’s the second act. So, don’t be surprised if you find your story line or the direction of the story starting to wander a little bit. Around page 50 or 60 you’ll begin to get back on the narrative path—the Mid-Point is that great anchor that keeps your story line rooted in your structure.

			Pinch I helps you get to the Mid-Point. If you feel your story’s too long, and there are too many scenes or pages, don’t worry about it. The questions that always seem to come up when you’re writing are: “Is this scene necessary? Should I write it, or not?” And the answer is this: when in doubt, write. If you start censoring yourself as you are writing the first words-on-paper draft, you’ll find that you are starting a process within your own head that will not serve you or your writing experience. If you start criticizing yourself too much you’ll keep telling yourself that you don’t need this scene, or that scene, and if that happens, more often than not, you’ll find that the impulse to second-guess or criticize your own work will impede your writing process. If you are in doubt about whether to write a scene or not, just write it. The worst that can happen is that your first words-on-paper draft is one hundred seventy to two hundred pages long. So what? It’s easier to cut out scenes than it is to write new ones. Trust me on this.

			Just keep writing, moving forward, page by page, scene by scene, from Mid-Point to Pinch II to Plot Point II. Writing, as I have to constantly remind myself, is a day-by-day process, three pages a day, five or six days a week. If you have a full-time job, think about the ten pages you’re going to write during the week, then on the weekend sit down and write them. In this way, you can do ten pages a week easily.

			Writing Act II will be about the same as writing Act I, except now, working with screenplay form is easier, and by now you’ve built up enough discipline so that you can sit down for a few hours each day and work on your script. But you’re making more changes now than in Act I. And that sometimes creates a problem. It’s easy to get lost or confused in the maze of your own creation.

			You may become aware of judgments and decisions and evaluations that pop up with regular persistence. Suddenly you’ll know a line of dialogue doesn’t ring true, that you’re forcing it; you’ll know deep down inside yourself that what you’re writing is not working and you’ll know that it’s not very good.

			You might think to yourself, if these pages are so bad, what about the other pages I’ve written? You might go back and read some of the pages you’ve written. And you know what? They’re terrible. Awful.

			Fear and panic and insecurity grip your heart; your mind begins racing. What am I doing? This story doesn’t work at all. You try to calm yourself, but it’s impossible. What to do? Drink? Drugs? Depression? Sex? A buying spree? Vacation? Isolation? Lose your identity? Feel worthless?

			You need some help, you might reason, an “assessment.” You’ll call a friend to read your pages. You might expect the worst, but deep down you know what you want to hear.

			Your friend reads what you’ve written and confirms your doubts and fears, saying, “I think your pages are fine, there’s nothing wrong with them.” Of course, they’re not telling you the truth, they’re just trying to be nice and spare your feelings.

			Or your friend will tell you your pages are not strong enough; they’re “too wordy,” or the focus should be on another character, and what you should do is this, and they give you an elaborate example of what they think your story is about. Of course, they don’t know because you don’t know either. What to do, what to do?

			At this point, you’re over the edge in paranoia and, like Bob Dylan sings, you’re “stuck inside of Mobile, with the Memphis blues again.”

			Many people just stop right there. They believe their own judgments, their own evaluations, their own opinions. They become their own victims. The truth is you can’t see anything right now because you have no objectivity and no overview at all. What you wrote may not be very good. So what? Most of the First Half of Act II is not going to be very good. It seems contrived, dull, stilted, or overwritten.

			This insecurity acts as a trigger, springing judgments and opinions into play. There’s only one thing you must remember about your judgments and evaluations: who is making these comments and decisions?

			You answer that one.

			You can either let your judgments and evaluations get in the way of your writing experience or not. It’s up to you. You do have a choice; you do have a voice, a say in the matter. Use it.

			If you find your mind racing, criticizing what you’re writing, there is a simple exercise you can do to quiet your mind. Simply give the critic a voice.

			When you’re writing your pages, the “critic” part of you that’s at the back of your head will be relentless and unmerciful. It will hound you, harass you, and hassle you. You’re going to have to deal with it sometime—it might as well be now.

			How do you deal with this? Take a blank sheet of paper. Title it the Critic’s Page. Put it near your work pages, whether you write by computer or longhand or typewriter. Now there is your work sheet and a blank sheet of paper in front of you—one for the script, the other for “the critic.”

			Now, start writing. As you’re writing you’ll notice some familiar thoughts or judgments or self-evaluations coming up. Write these negative thoughts and judgments down (they’re never positive, unfortunately) on the Critic’s Page.

			Continue writing your script. If and when another negative thought or judgment or doubt crops up in your mind, simply write it down on the Critic’s Page. You might want to number each comment the critic makes.

			Give the critic a voice. You’ll be writing and the critic’s voice will emerge. Stop working on the screenplay and write down what the critic says. See how it makes you feel. When you complete one page, use another. If you’re like me, you’ll probably be writing more on the Critic’s Pages than you will on your script pages.

			The first day you do this exercise you may end up with about two or three pages of screenplay and one or two pages of criticism. The next day, do it again. But this time you’re going to be more watchful and you may end up with two pages of screenplay and three or four Critic’s Pages. The next day, do the same thing and you may have three pages of script and three pages of the Critic.

			When you’ve done this exercise for three days, put all the Critic’s Pages in a drawer and forget about them.

			Go back to writing your screenplay for a couple of days. After you’ve taken a short break from the Critic, open up the drawer and read the Critic’s Pages. Just read them. You’ll notice an amazing thing. All the comments the Critic made say the same thing! They’re all negative, they’re all judgmental, and they all say that what you’re writing is not very good, the dialogue is poor, the story and characters are weak, and you’re probably just wasting your time writing the screenplay. Or, maybe you should get a partner, or go work out or go shopping or something.

			Every day that you were working and jotting down the Critic’s thoughts and comments, they’re basically saying the same thing. The pages are no damn good.

			So what? Maybe the Critic is right; maybe the pages aren’t very good at this point! But this is only the first words-on-paper draft. It doesn’t mean you can’t change them to make them better. What’s so important about this exercise is that you become aware of the voice inside your head making these judgments and evaluations. No matter what you write or say, the Critic inside your head is going to say the same thing. Worthless, not good enough, or it’s been done before so give it up.

			You can’t give it up. After all, your negative thoughts are only your own self-judgments, they don’t mean too much in the broad scheme of things. Everybody has them. We either let them get in the way of what we want to do, or we sidestep them. If we react too intensely, or too seriously, we can easily become our own victims.

			And I speak from experience.

			“Perfection,” as Jean Renoir constantly reminded me, “exists only in the mind, not in reality.” Something to think about.

			As you continue to write the scenes and sequences of Act II, remember your visual dynamics. Continually keep in mind that you want to keep your story visual, cinematic. Even if you are using a screenwriting formatting software like Final Draft, notice whether your scenes go from INT. to INT. to INT. to INT. with only a few EXT. scenes. Think about transitions, those lines of description or dialogue that take you from one scene to the next. Do you show your character walking out of the building? Standing on the street waiting for a taxi? Riding on the metro? Driving in a car through the crowded streets? Walking into a building? Taking an elevator? Arriving at the airport? Do you show the plane in flight? Landing at the airport? In the baggage area? Think visually. Open up your story. As an example, go from INT. to EXT. to INT. to INT. to EXT. And be aware of visual transitions.

			Transitions are those scenes, or sequences, or montages that show the passage of time. Links between the scenes and sequences have to be conceived visually, for moving the action from one scene to the next requires a visual transition. Transitions bridge time and move the action forward quickly, visually. Whether you’re writing an original screenplay, or adapting a novel, play, magazine, or news article into a screenplay, each scene or sequence can bridge a particular time to a particular place in order to move the story forward. To go from Point A to Point B in a screenplay requires making transitions which connect the two.

			There are four major ways to make transitions: cutting from picture to picture, sound to sound, music to music, or special effect to special effect. There can be dissolves, fade outs, and smash cuts.

			It wasn’t too long ago that the screenwriter depended on the director or film editor to create these visual transitions, but it is really the writer’s responsibility to write the required transitions. One of the recognizable traits of a professional screenwriter is his or her ability to write good visual transitions. At the present time, there is an evolutionary trend in the style and sophistication of the art of transition. Even a script like Pulp Fiction, which is sequential and episodic, uses effective transitions so the five episodes that make up the screenplay seem to be connected into a single story line. The title page even proclaims the script is really “three stories about one story.” If Tarantino and Avery had not created those transitions, the script would have been disjointed and episodic and not worked as well as it does.

			As far as I’m concerned, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to write these transitional scenes that move the story forward and bridge time, place, and action. Writing good transitions is also a very good way to solve a number of problems.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, for example, the passage of time is handled incredibly well. Only one shot is needed to show us the passage of time: the large posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, and Raquel Welch pinned up on the jail cell’s walls visually indicate the passage of several decades. In How to Make an American Quilt (Jane Anderson), Finn (Winona Ryder), a young woman of twenty-six, is kneeling down looking at a book and we hear her voiceover narration: “How do two separate people fuse into this thing called a couple? And if your love is that strong, then how do you still keep a little room for yourself…” That’s what the whole film is about, and when Finn stands up, we match cut to her as a little girl of five or six, looking at the women in the quilting bee as her narration leads us directly into the story line.

			Why are transitions so important? Because when you’re reading a script, or seeing a movie, it has to flow smoothly across a time period that is usually not more than two hours. The story line has to be a seamless parade of images across the page or screen, and time, then, becomes a relative phenomenon. Days and years and decades can be condensed into seconds, a few seconds stretched into minutes as a leap is made from one image to another. That’s one of the things that makes The Shawshank Redemption such a remarkable movie; the passage of time does not draw attention to itself. It becomes an integral part of the fabric of the screenplay.

			Transitions can be as varied and as multiple as the colors in a kaleidoscope. In The Silence of the Lambs, for example, the screenwriter, Ted Tally, generally plays the last line of one scene over the first line of the next. The dialogue is used to bridge time and action and shows one way that sound can be used as the link connecting two different scenes. Tally ends one scene with a question, then opens the next scene by answering that question.

			This kind of overlapping transition scene has been done many times before, of course, most notably in Julia, Alvin Sargent’s Academy Award–winning screenplay adapted from Lillian Hellman’s Pentimento. But the way Tally approached his transitions pushes the boundaries of the medium in such a way that we’re not even aware of them. If you’re watching a movie and become aware of the visual transitions, or feel the “arty” influence of the director in each scene, chances are it’s not a very good film.

			The style and sophistication of the transition is evolving all the time. In Lone Star, John Sayles makes his transitions bridging time and action in a very unique way: he has the characters remain in present time, then pans the camera over to a character or a place and suddenly we have moved either forward or backward in time. It’s very effective, extremely visual, and I think shows the remarkable versatility of Sayles as a writer and director.

			Apollo 13 (William Broyles and Al Reinert) is a film based on an actual historic event, and the screenwriters bridge time and action by simply cutting back and forth, a technique called cross-cutting, between the three astronauts in the spacecraft and the Mission Control team in Houston. The story moves forward by action/reaction, and is held together by the events and circumstances. Thelma & Louise also moves forward by cross-cutting, between the two women on the run and the policeman searching for them.

			Every screenplay has its own particular style and form in terms of transitions. An action film usually has short, quick transitions, because the film moves forward at a very rapid pace and we have to be swept up into the action. But in a character-driven piece like Brokeback Mountain the transitions come from silence, or looks between the characters, or a few lines of dialogue. There is never any one right way to make transitions. The only criterion is whether it works or not.

			There may be times when you’re so engrossed in putting the story down on paper that you don’t even think about the transitional flow of the script. But when you finish the first draft you might discover that you’ve written a screenplay that may be a hundred and sixty pages or longer. During the actual screenwriting process that’s okay, but ultimately it’s too long, so you’re going to have to do a lot of work to cut it to length. A one-hundred-forty-plus-page screenplay is only accepted if it’s by William Goldman, Quentin Tarantino, David Koepp, or Eric Roth.

			If your screenplay is too long, and you feel there’s too much going on, or too many things happening or too many characters, look for ways to bridge the time and action through transitions. Transitions solve many problems in screenwriting and sometimes the bridge to another time or another place can be as simple as changing the character’s clothes, or using match cuts, or changing the weather, or using holidays to condense the time and action.

			Don’t describe too much or explain too much, and don’t end up with “thick” paragraphs. Leave wide margins, left and right, at top and bottom. You want a lot of space on the page. Be sparse and simple in your descriptions, using no more than five or six sentences for each one. Read a screenplay, any good screenplay, and look for how transitions are executed.

			Sometimes you may have to write a full scene—beginning, middle, and end—before you discover you can cut it down to a portion of the beginning and a few lines of the end.

			Forget about camera angles and technical information. Don’t show the reader how much you know. Simply write in master scenes. INT. OFFICE—DAY, and go from there.

			Your writing will feel comfortable now, and your characters will be talking to you, telling you what they want to do, where they want to go. Go with the process. Don’t be too dogmatic about staying in control.

			Follow the focus of your main character; be aware that you want the main character to be active, to initiate things, to cause things to happen. Your main character must always be active, like Inman in Cold Mountain, not passive. Action is character; what a person does is who he or she is, not what he says. Film is behavior.

			If you need to restructure your story, do it. Structure is flexible, like a tree that bends in the wind but does not break. In the same way, scenes and sequences and passages of dialogue can be moved or repositioned anywhere you want them to go—as long as it works!

			Until a few years ago, buildings in Los Angeles and San Francisco could legally not be more than twelve stories high because of the continuous earthquake hazard. Now high-rise buildings are going up everywhere. In their construction they are designed to roll and sway back and forth during a quake, giving in to the shock of the earth moving. Nature is too strong to resist, so we need to bend with it.

			The same thing can be said for structure. Remember the definition: “to build something or put together something.” It is not a rigid, unbreakable foundation, but fluid and organic to the changing needs of your story line. If you let it, structure can bend to the needs of your story. That’s why the paradigm is not a formula like many people say; it is a form that bends and fits the needs of your story.

			One of my students was writing a coming-of-age comedy about a young girl in the sixties who loses her virginity in a tacky, awful, first sexual encounter and becomes pregnant. In the end, she journeys to Mexico for an abortion and returns to the U.S. just as John Kennedy is assassinated. It is more than just a “losing virginity” story; it is the story about a young girl coming of age in a time when the entire nation is shifting its consciousness and awareness.

			Originally, the story was structured like this: at Plot Point I she sees the boy she is attracted to; at Pinch I she knows this is the person she wants to make love with; at Mid-Point she has sex with the boy. At Pinch II she discovers she’s pregnant, and at Plot Point II she leaves for Mexico to have the abortion. Act III deals with the abortion and her return home, a lot older and wiser.

			When my student started writing and began to build and define the relationship between her main character and her two best friends, she realized she needed more time and pages to reveal their friendship. By the time she reached her supposed Mid-Point, having sex with her first love, her main character hadn’t even considered birth control. (This was the sixties, remember, before the Pill.)

			The writer became anxious and concerned, and I told her to simply change the structure and expand her story line. At first, she resisted, but I told her we had to bend with the needs of the story. Reluctantly, she changed it. Plot Point I now became a scene in which the girl makes the decision to lose her virginity. Pinch I became the party where she meets the boy but he doesn’t want anything to do with her. The new Mid-Point is where she is determined to have sex with him. Pinch II now becomes the moment she has sex with the boy and loses her virginity, and at Plot Point II she becomes pregnant. Mexico would be a very small sequence in Act III.

			All she had to do was shift the structure to accommodate the needs of the story. Structure is what “holds” the story together, but it can bend and shift to include whatever new elements you need to put in.

			When you’re writing Act II, your story will most likely be shifting and changing. You’ll write one scene, then find you need to add another scene that will dramatize an aspect of your story you hadn’t thought about when you were doing the cards. Go with it. Let it change. Right now, you’re finding the focus of your story and it’s changing because you can’t really “see” what you’ve written. You have no objectivity, no overview; you’re just climbing the mountain and can only see the pages you’re writing and the pages you’ve written.

			Writing should always be an adventure. The paradigm is a roadmap of your screenplay. You can get off the main highway and go exploring and if you get lost or confused and don’t know where you are or where you’re going, go back to the paradigm; if need be, choose a new Plot Point, Pinch, or Mid-Point and start over from there. It’s only temporary. Just tell your story.

			You’ll learn to adapt to the needs of your story. As Renoir used to say, “learning is the ability to see the relationship between things.” It took me many years to understand what he meant.

			I take a lot of baths when I’m working and do a lot of work in the tub, preparing new material, planning the next scene or chapter, and so on. Dalton Trumbo (Spartacus, Lonely Are the Brave, to name only two) worked in his bathtub a lot, as does Nick Meyer (The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, Time After Time, and several Star Trek films).

			My bathtub sits next to a large three-sided bay window; it has a big stationary pane in the middle and two smaller windows on either side.

			One day while I was taking a bath, a large black bumblebee found its way into the bathroom and couldn’t find a way out. He circled the room, then gathered speed and flew directly into the large middle pane of glass. He tried again and again, and the same thing happened over and over again. I tried to stifle my concern as the rage and panic of the bee became louder and louder.

			I watched the bee slamming into the window for what seemed an eternity, knowing that all he had to do to get free was stop, rest a moment, get his bearings, and look around to see if there was another way out. The open side window, fresh air, and escape were only three inches away.

			Couldn’t he see, I wondered, that what he was doing wasn’t working? As this drama unfolded, I wondered whether I had ever done the same thing, pursued something—a job, a screenplay, a scene, a relationship—trying to make something work that wasn’t working. I thought about it and recalled many episodes in my life when I had pursued something that wasn’t working, that I knew would never work, but I continually struggled to make it work with the same intensity as that bee slamming into the solid pane of glass.

			Emotion welled up inside me. Yes, I had done that, I knew, and more than once. I still do it, in some ways and probably will do it again. It’s a universal experience, one we all share, human as well as bee.

			I watched that bee lunge into that glass again and again. I started getting angry. I wanted him out of my bathroom. I wasn’t going to chase or kill him, I just wanted him out. I closed my eyes and turned inward and steadied myself with my breathing. Then I thought to myself, Bee, just stop what you’re doing. It’s not working. Admit it, face it, confront it, deal with it. The open window, your escape to freedom, is only inches away.

			I focused on the bee, visualizing him leaving by the window that was only a few inches away. For a moment, nothing happened. Then suddenly, like magic, the bee stopped, resting on the glass. The silence was broken only by the slight dripping of water in the bath. I held my breath, afraid to move. Then the bee arched back, felt the stream of fresh air coming through the open window, and was gone.

			I breathed a long sigh of relief as a wave of emotion surged through me. I had shared a common experience with that bee, learned from him, and all the sadness and unhappiness and despair and pain of remembered moments filled me. Tears welled up in my eyes. It was a somber, profound moment.

			“Trying to make something work that wasn’t working” has often happened when I was writing a screenplay. I’d get lost or confused about my story and then wander around searching to get back on track, not knowing where I was or where I was going. What I was doing wasn’t working, but I continued to think that if I was persistent enough, and kept working and working and working, “hitting my head against the typewriter,” as I described it, I would eventually find a way out of my confusion.

			It never worked.

			One of my students was writing a contemporary romantic comedy about a single mother, a successful career woman, who has been in a relationship with a psychiatrist for four years. When the story opens, the therapist, a successful author and also a single parent, will not commit himself to marriage.

			In the back story, the relationship has been through several upheavals. At Plot Point I, the main character severs the relationship “for good” and joins a support group for people who have been in dead-end relationships. The First Half of Act II deals with the sudden appearance of the ex-husband after an absence of five years. He won’t leave her alone. She resists as much as she can, then finally gives in.

			She reestablishes the relationship with her ex-husband. What didn’t work the first time around also doesn’t work the second time around, and she ends her involvement with him. The Mid-Point occurs when she resolves to “make it or break it” with the psychiatrist.

			Everything in the script was working except for the First Half of Act II. The appearance of the ex-husband never worked within the context of the story line, as funny or as cute as it might have been. The screenplay was based on a true story, and the writer was determined to make it work, come hell or high water. She wrote four totally different versions of the First Half of Act II, and none of them worked. The context, the relationship with the ex-husband, never worked to begin with; either the main character was unsympathetic or the ex-husband was unlikable.

			Finally, my student threw her pages down in despair and disgust, lost, confused, angry, panicked. So I told her the story of the bumblebee. The First Half of Act II wasn’t working, and she just better stop slamming against the windowpane.

			Reluctantly, she agreed.

			So she went back to the drawing board, and in the revised version, when the ex-husband does show up, she tells him to get lost. With her newfound independence she becomes even more attractive, and the humor comes out of her interaction with men. The Mid-Point stayed the same.

			If you find your material is not working, just stop and rethink it. If it works, it works; if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. The things you try that don’t work will always show you what does work. You have to make these creative mistakes in order to keep the focus on your story line.

			The moral of the story is simple: if you do get lost, or confused, or if you’re trying to make something work that doesn’t work, just stop and take a look around. See if you’re slamming against a windowpane.

			Rethink it. You’re working in ten-page segments of a thirty-page unit of dramatic action. If you do get lost, you can always find out where you are; just go back and look at your story line on the paradigm and see if you have to shift your structural components, or change the dramatic context. Ask your characters what you should do; they’ll tell you what you need to know.

			The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. By the same token, give yourself a pat on the back if something works the way you thought it would.

			Confusion is the first step toward clarity.


				THE EXERCISE

				It’s time now to sit down and “do it.”

				You’ve prepared your material well.

				Start from Plot Point I and put the cards out as a reference point to the Mid-Point. Work in ten-page units, keeping Pinch I clearly in mind. Focus on conflict. Remember, if you know your character’s dramatic need, you’ll be able to create obstacles to that need and then your story becomes your character overcoming all obstacles to achieve his or her dramatic need. Sometimes, if you’re stuck on a scene, it’s beneficial to create the opposite point of view; you can write the scene from the other character’s point of view, then go back and change it, writing it from your character’s point of view. If your character is an actress reading for a major part, and she knows she’s right for the part, write it from the director’s point of view that she’s not right for the part. She’s the wrong type, the wrong size, whatever, and your scene will have her convincing him that she is right for the part.

				That’s how you create conflict on the page and avoid it in your writing experience.

			Act III: The Resolution


			 				Sarah (V.O.): “The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope, because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of a human life, maybe we can, too.”

				 					 						—James Cameron and William Wisher

						Terminator 2: Judgment Day





			Act III is approximately a thirty-page unit of dramatic action that begins at the end of Plot Point II and extends through to the end of your screenplay. It is held together by the dramatic context known as Resolution.

			Resolution means “to find a solution; to explain or make clear; to break up into separate elements or parts.” It is not the end of your story, it is the solution of your screenplay. Up until this point in the screenwriting process, the ending, that specific scene or sequence that you want to end the film with, may have changed.

			Does your original resolution still work?

			That’s the first thing you’ll have to decide as you approach the final act of your screenplay. In most cases, you’ll find your initial impulse for the resolution, the very first creative decision you had to make when preparing your script, will probably be the same now as it was then. Think about it.

			Way back in the beginning, we chose to start the creative process with a simple choice: What happens at the end of your screenplay? What happens to your main character? Does he/she live or die? Succeed or fail? Marry or divorce? Win the race or not? Escape safely and bring the bad guys to justice? Destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom? Be reunited with a loved one or not? Recover the stolen merchandise or not? Claim the heavyweight championship of the world or not? Be found guilty or innocent of the crime?

			Good films are always resolved—one way or another.

			Do you remember the endings of: Match Point? Rushmore? Finding Nemo? Spider-Man 2? Bonnie and Clyde? Red River? Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? The Treasure of the Sierra Madre? Casablanca? Annie Hall? Coming Home? Jaws? The Shawshank Redemption? American Beauty? The Searchers? Terminator 2: Judgment Day?

			What is the Resolution of your story? Has it changed since you began writing your screenplay? If so, what is the new Resolution—the new solution to your story? You do have a choice in the matter; you can choose to keep the resolution the same, or you can choose to change it. The choice is always yours. We’re not talking about the ending here, that specific scene or sequence that ends the screenplay. We’re talking about the solution to your story line.

			The key thing to remember is that your story always moves forward—it follows a path, a direction, a line of progression from beginning to end, whether it’s told in flashback or not. Whether it’s told nonlinearly, like The Bourne Supremacy, The Constant Gardener (Jeffrey Caine), The Usual Suspects, or Memento, or linearly, like Match Point, Walk the Line, Sideways, or Brokeback Mountain, direction is defined as a line of development, the path along which something lies. And that is the story line.

			Everything is related in the screenplay, as it is in life. You don’t have to know the specific details of your ending when you are writing your screenplay, but you do have to know what happens and how it affects the characters. That’s resolution.

			Understanding the basic dynamics of your story’s resolution is essential. That is the process that began at the very beginning of the screenwriting process. When you were laying out your story line, building it, putting it together, scene by scene, act by act, piece by piece, the first thing you did was determine the resolution, the solution of your story. You might have been working out the idea and shaping it into a dramatic story line, but you made a creative choice, a decision, about what the resolution was going to be.

			As you stand at the edge of Act III and peer into the blank pages that lie ahead, you will see that there are usually a few story points that need to be resolved. You may have already determined the ending may need to change. If you want it to change, let it change. Structure is flexible, remember; like the tree that bends in the wind but does not break.

			When you’ve completed Act II, stop writing and see where you are; what do you need to do in order to resolve your story? If you’ve already prepared your fourteen cards for Act III, go over them and see if they still work effectively. Most of the time they will be between 80 or 90 percent accurate, though sometimes I’ll look at my cards and think I can do better so I’ll redo the cards with new scenes and sometimes restructure the material. Sometimes, I’ll forgo the cards and just do a new “beat sheet.” For example, I’ll write “the scene in the car,” “planning the job,” “the scene at the hospital,” “the chase sequence,” and so on. I don’t need anything more specific than that. It usually works. If it doesn’t, I’ll go back and review the action, both physical and emotional, by writing a short essay on what happens in Act III.

			Act III, the Resolution, is usually anchored by one or two, or sometimes three, dramatic (or comedic) elements that are needed resolve your story. When you approach Act III, the very first thing to do is define those specific scenes that you need. What is the resolution? Is it the same as it was when you began writing? Or has it changed? If it has changed, what do you have to do to keep the story line consistent? What is the ending, that specific scene or sequence that completes the screenplay? Can you begin to trace your narrative action line from the end of Plot Point II to the end of the story? Can you find a key scene or scenes that will lead you to the ending and dramatize the resolution?

			Sometimes it helps to write a two-page essay about what happens in Act III. In my own experience, I find Act III the easiest part of the screenplay to write. By this time in the screenwriting process, I’ve straightened out and fixed the story line, found new dimensions in the characters, and reached a fluid source of creative energy that flows easily and smoothly. I also know that what I have to do to complete Act III, to complete this first words-on-paper draft, is simply put in the time in front of the computer—though I know that’s easier said than done.

			Before you start writing Act III, go over the cards or beat sheet until you feel comfortable with the story’s progression. Make sure you understand what elements need to be resolved in Act III. You’ll probably find you’ll be on automatic, comfortable with the writing and discipline and story line. You still won’t know whether it’s working or not, because you’ll lack objectivity, but it will usually feel like it’s working, in spite of any doubts or insecurities. Just keep writing. Trust the process. Lay it down, shot by shot, scene by scene, page by page.

			Act III is going to be driven by resolving your story. As mentioned earlier, either your action drives the character or your character drives the action. Many times, you can combine both. Woody Allen’s Match Point is a good example, as is Cinderella Man.

			There are times when the entire Third Act becomes a long action sequence that strengthens and reinforces the character as well. In Cinderella Man, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) is given the opportunity to fight Max Baer (Craig Bierko) for the Heavyweight Championship of the World. This is an extraordinary opportunity for James Braddock but it carries a heavy burden of potential injury and the possibility of death. By the time we reach Plot Point II, it’s been established that Max Baer has already killed two fighters in the ring. Braddock, like so many others, has been a victim of the Great Depression and has undergone severe challenges just to care for his wife and three young children. It is an opportunity of a lifetime but the risks are high. That is the dramatic situation at the end of Plot Point II as many people think this fight will be a legitimate case of murder, while others want to be there to engage in the thrill of watching blood being spilt.

			This is the dilemma that generates the major conflict within the family during Act III that must be resolved. Even though this is based on a true story, the filmmakers have taken the dramatic license to heighten the emotional situation that must be resolved. Before the fight, Mae (Renée Zellweger) tells James, “I stood by you until now. For all of it. But not for this, Jim. I just can’t. So, you train, all you want. But you find a way to get out of that fight. Break your hand if you have to. But if you set foot out of this door to fight Max Baer I won’t be behind you anymore.”

			That is the final ultimatum. How is it going to be resolved? “This is the only thing I know how to do,” Braddock replies. “I have to believe I have some say over our lives. That sometimes, I can change things. If I don’t, it’s like I’m dead already.” This struggle between family and fighting in the championship fight with the possibility of death or severe physical injury is the conflict that governs the entire Third Act. It is an internal as well as external conflict that must be resolved.

			Act III begins on the morning of the fight. James says his goodbyes to his children and his wife and leaves for the stadium. There are a few scenes before we go into the dressing room to prepare for the fight. Mae comes into the locker room unexpectedly and unites husband and wife: she tells him, “I’m always behind you. So you just remember who you really are…you’re the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock.”

			After that, the fight begins. The fifteen-round fight takes up the rest of the screenplay. And the final shot of the script, after he wins, says it all: “Jim stands in the center of the ring, his arm raised in victory, tears flowing from his eyes…”

			So it ends; and what needed to be resolved in terms of story and character has been resolved. There are a few taglines superimposed over shots of the ring just before the final fade out, but the story line has been resolved in an exciting and compassionate way.

			The resolution in Cinderella Man may seem easy, perhaps predictable. After all, the screenplay is based on a true story. So, even though we know what’s going to happen, that Braddock wins to become the Heavyweight Champion of the World, the real issue is how it is done; the action is imbued with strong action and strong character. Even though the story is based on a true incident, Cinderella Man, like Apollo 13, captures the integrity of the story and remains true to its nature. Why it works so well is not simply a result of what the resolution is, but how it is executed. That’s what makes a good screenplay stand out.

			It’s different in Match Point. This is a character study about the nature of luck—some people have it, some don’t, as the narrator tells us in the opening shot. But the issue of “making your own luck,” is more to the point here. At Plot Point II, Nola (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant by Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who is married to Chloe (Emily Mortimer). It’s a very difficult situation, one which is weighing heavily on Chris. What’s he going to do? Tell Chloe the truth about his infidelity or sacrifice “the good life” for a life of uncertainty and financial struggle? Neither is acceptable. And then, one night, he finds the solution. What does he do? And how is he going to resolve the issue? (I don’t like to reveal endings so I won’t say any more than this.) Needless to say, he is a person born to luck and on the surface, at least, holds the winning hand due to luck and circumstance. But what’s going to happen, character-wise, after the movie has ended? Will he still be living “the good life”?

			If you look at some of the classic American films of the last few decades—from the Sixties and The Wild Bunch where everybody dies, and Hud (Harriet Frank and Irving Ravetch) where the “hero” is still the same son of a bitch at the end of the script as he was at the beginning; to the Seventies with The French Connection (Ernest Tidyman), Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius), and Coming Home (Waldo Salt), where the endings are violent or bleak or thought-provoking; to the Eighties with Ordinary People (Alvin Sargent), Witness, Terms of Endearment, and An Officer and a Gentleman (Douglas Day Stewart); to the nineties with films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Dances With Wolves (Michael Blake), and Magnolia (Paul Thomas Anderson), you’ll see that the resolution reflects the changing attitudes toward war, protest, racism, and social unrest. Some of the endings are positive or thought-provoking or feel-good endings, while others are bleak, negative, and in the end, everybody we care about dies.

			Endings are tricky and they depend upon a lot of variables. I happened to be in Berlin a few months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, teaching a workshop for fifty German screenwriters. The course was held by one of the many universities where students were on strike. The corridors were empty and the hallways covered with slogans and sayings that reflected the attitude of the strike. It was a very exciting time and I was working with writers who wanted to comment and reflect upon the historical times in which they were living.

			But when I read their stories, I was astonished; while the stories were good and interesting, there was a certain, uncomfortable consistency. Out of the fifty stories, forty-eight of them ended in death, suicide, destruction, or mayhem. I tried to explain that at this point in time they were living in an historical moment, and each writer had an unique opportunity to be focused on what kind of future they might want to create. But almost all of them had made a creative decision that their stories would be “true to life,” meaning they would end unhappily and generally “despairing.”

			When I thought about it, I realized that they had come from a literary Germanic tradition that usually ends unhappily. And yet, they had the opportunity to bring forth something new that would reflect a future filled with new possibilities. I’ve always maintained that as screenwriters we have a certain responsibility to alter and impact our audience. I think of it as kind of a mission statement: by choosing the creative act of writing a screenplay, we have the opportunity of giving rise to a new possibility, based not on the past, or old patterns of behavior, but on a future built on hope and unity and self-worth, where we honor our uniqueness and individuality, our humanity, so we can achieve a higher state of consciousness.

			That’s my point of view. It’s a choice for you to make regarding the resolution of your screenplay. So when you think about the ending of your screenplay, about the resolution of your stories, aim for the highest; it’s not necessary to end your story line in a simplistic manner, meaning by death, destruction, suicide, and mayhem. I pointed that out to the German screenwriters, and while they come from that kind of historical and literary tradition, it reflects either an attachment to the past or a fear of the future. The future is what we make it.

			I’m not saying to insert a false, optimistic, “up,” “happily ever after” ending. What I am saying is to find a resolution and ending that fits and conforms to your story, a resolution that fits the times in which we live, and reflects our human values. Films like: The Lord of the Rings, Whale Rider (Niki Caro), Erin Brockovich (Susannah Grant), Million Dollar Baby (Paul Haggis), Cinderella Man, The Shawshank Redemption, and Paradise Now (Hany Abu-Assad, Bero Beyer, and Pierre Hodgson) all reflect this attitude.

			In other films, like Woody Allen’s Match Point, The Constant Gardener, Walk the Line, Brokeback Mountain, Y Tu Mamá También (Alfonso and Carlos Cuarón), Capote (Dan Futterman), and Good Night, and Good Luck (George Clooney and Grant Heslov), the resolutions are integrated into the story; they are real, believable, and true. But if you have a choice in the matter, and can project a positive, uplifting ending, then you have more of a chance of having your screenplay produced. And that’s the name of the game. If you doubt this, and think an up, happy, or positive ending is simplistic or banal, simply look at all the fairy tales, myths, epics, and adventures that have formed the basis of literature since the beginning of the written word. You might reply that the ancient Greek tragedies or Shakespearian tragedies always end in death and mayhem, and I would agree. But on the highest emotional and spiritual level, these works of art ennoble and enrich the characters and the universality of the human spirit. In the eternal conflict between good and evil, does evil ever win?

			Never.

			That’s just the way it is. In the long run, good always triumphs over evil. Just be aware of it.

			What is the resolution of your story? When you establish that, you can decide on the specific ending. But first, does your ending still work? Is it still effective? Do you have to change the ending because of the changes you’ve made during the first two acts? Have you thought of another ending, a new one, more vital, more dramatic, more visual, than your original one?

			Don’t think too much about it. If you try to figure out the “correct,” the “right” ending, you’ll never do it. Choose an ending that works, that fits your story. You’ll find out soon enough whether it’s effective or not.

			No matter what kind of screenplay you’re writing, just focus on resolving your story and character. If you’re writing a comedy, does your character change during your screenplay? If so, pay it off in Act III. Show it visually and dramatically to resolve your story.

			In Annie Hall, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a character who does not change—he is the same at the end of the screenplay as he was at the beginning. Cynical, filled with self-pity and doubt, he wants Annie Hall to fit into his expectations of what he thinks a relationship should be. Remember the lobster scene in the kitchen? Annie and Alvy are cooking lobsters and both are afraid to stick them into the boiling water. It’s a beautiful scene, as memorable as a Marx Brothers scene from A Night at the Opera or Duck Soup. In Act III, after Annie has left Alvy to be with Tony Lacey (Paul Simon), he tries to recreate the lobster scene with a different woman. Same setting, same situation, same action, only now the result is different; it is forced, contrived, unfunny.

			Alvy Singer’s character is a key element in the success of the film. In the opening monologue, Alvy says, “I wouldn’t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member. That’s the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.” It is prophetic, because it is paid off at the end. Annie changes, he doesn’t.

			The script ends with Alvy delivering a rambling monologue: “[Annie] had moved back to New York. She was living in SoHo with some guy. And when I met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity. [A four-and-a-half-hour documentary that Alvy had turned her on to.] Which I counted as a personal triumph…and I thought of an old joke, you know, this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, ‘Doc, my brother’s crazy. He thinks he’s a chicken.’ And, uh, the doctor says, ‘Well, why don’t you turn him in?’ And the guys says, ‘I would, but I need the eggs.’ Well, I guess that’s pretty much how I feel about relationships. You know, they’re totally irrational and crazy and absurd…but, I guess we keep goin’ through it because, most of us need the eggs.”

			His character is consistent; at the end, he’s alone, as cynical and resistant and set in his ways as he always was. His unwillingness to change, expand, and grow leads to this point. Sad, yet moving: a perceptive and universal comment about the human condition.

			On the other hand, if you’re writing an action film, or action-adventure, there are times when the resolution of the Third Act becomes one long action sequence. In Witness, John Book (Harrison Ford) has just acknowledged his feelings to Rachel (Kelly McGillis). But no sooner do they acknowledge their passions for each other than the bad cops show up at the farm where Book is hiding. They have come to kill him. The Third Act begins as the bad cops park the car, open the trunk, take out their guns, and start the long walk down to the farmhouse.

			In Witness, an excellent film to study, three things need to be resolved. One, what’s going to happen to John Book? Does he live or die? Two, does he bring the bad cops to justice? And three, what’s going to happen between Rachel and John? How do they resolve their relationship? Those three things are resolved during the Third Act, which is an exciting action sequence and embraces the resolution of the screenplay.

			An action film provides you with a number of ways to resolve your story line. One of my favorites is James Cameron’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day (James Cameron and William Wisher). In my opinion, Terminator 2 is one of the most influential films of our time. Not only does it revolutionize the technology of filmmaking through the use of computer-graphic imagery, but it incorporates a spiritual dimension into the action film unlike anything that has been seen before or since.

			Terminator 2: Judgment Day reflects a certain ambiguity in the human condition. As technology becomes more advanced, human beings seem to become more withdrawn, inverted, some might even say, dehumanized. More like machines than humans. In Terminator 2, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a woman possessed and driven to avenge the death of her lover and the father of her young son John. The man she is determined to kill is the scientist who created the computer chip that, according to the scenario of the existing future, takes us into the age of machines. Sarah knows that if she can kill this one man before that one little computer chip is created, she can change the future and humankind might stand a chance of survival.

			“The future is not set,” is what the ten-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong), says at Mid-Point. “There is no fate but what we make.” At this point there are still two things left to be resolved in the story line: first, how can they destroy the T-1000, the “bad” Terminator (Robert Patrick), who seems indestructible. Second, do they live or die in saving the future for humankind? What happens to The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who is also a machine, a cyborg, and thus a product of the future? These things must be resolved by the end of the screenplay.

			Act III in Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a fast-moving chase sequence that takes place inside a huge steel factory. Cameron sets up the demise of the T-1000 when the truck overturns, spilling liquid nitrogen everywhere. The T-1000 is engulfed in it and freezes solid. “Hasta la vista, baby,” the Terminator says as he pulls the trigger and the T-1000 is blown into a million pieces.

			It looks like it’s the end and we think it’s done, that it’s finally over, until we see the shards of the T-1000 melting, liquefying, and the droplets start creeping together. Plip, plop, they merge into a sliding, slithering blob of mercury. Oh Jesus! The T-1000 is coming alive once more.

			“Okay, buckle your seat belts, here it comes…” is the way it reads in the screenplay. And then we’re in a massive shootout as the T-1000 is finally ripped apart as the force of the bullets thrusts the deadly cyborg into the flames of the molten steel. From ashes to ashes, dust to dust, steel to steel…this time it’s really the end of the T-1000 machine. The three of them stare down at the molten steel: “Is it dead?” John asks. “Terminated,” replies the Terminator. “Thank God it’s over,” Sarah says.

			“No,” the Terminator says. “There is another chip. And it must be destroyed also…It must end here…or I am the future,” says the Terminator, as he slowly descends into the molten steel. The script reads: “There is a final thumbs-up. Then it is gone.” We hold on this sea of flaming steel for a long moment, then dissolve into a little tag scene. We are racing down a dark highway at night and we hear Sarah’s final voiceover: “The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope, because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of a human life, then maybe we can, too.”

			Words to think about.

			As you sit down at the computer, writing pad, or typewriter, and engage in the creative process of resolving your story line, you may find that things will be going smoothly and easily until the last few pages of the script. Then you might feel strange, find yourself suddenly going “blank,” not knowing what to write or feeling that you have no real desire or enthusiasm or ambition to complete the screenplay. You’ll look for, and find, every excuse you can to avoid writing.

			It’s really very funny; after weeks and months of preparation, research, commitment, pain, toil, and trouble, after weeks of self-doubt, fears, and insecurities, after weeks of working your ass off, you may suddenly want to chuck it, with only a few pages to write.

			It’s absurd; you really can’t take it too seriously.

			What do you do?

			First of all, this seems to be a somewhat common experience among writers. It originates below the level of awareness. Every writer I know, including myself, experiences this phenomenon. Emotionally, you don’t want to end the screenplay. You want to hang on, not finish it. It’s like a terrible relationship—no matter how bad it is, it’s better than no relationship at all. The same principle applies to writing your screenplay. It’s hard to end. It’s been a great part of your life; you think about it every day, your characters are like friends, you talk about your story every chance you get. Writing it has kept you awake at night, caused you pain and suffering, and given you great satisfaction. Of course you don’t want to give it up!

			For what?

			It’s only natural to want “to hold on.”

			I hate to spoil your illusions, but there’s a lot of work left to do on this screenplay. When you finish this first words-on-paper draft, you’re only a third of the way through the screenwriting process. You’re not done with anything; the ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else. You’ve got two more drafts to go before you complete this first-draft screenplay.

			Just finish your script; resolve it. And once you write the final “Fade Out” give yourself a little pat on the back and celebrate with a glass of wine, or champagne, or whatever suits your disposition.

			Put your screenplay on the desk in front of you and see how many pages you’ve written. Pick it up. Feel it.

			You did it.

			Then take a week off.

			The first words-on-paper draft of the screenplay is now complete. Now the work really begins.


				THE EXERCISE

				Isolate the two or three dramatic elements of Act III that resolve your story line. Take a look at your cards for Act III. Do they still work? Do you need to change them? If need be, restructure Act III on fourteen new 3 × 5 cards. Then go over and over them.

				When you feel comfortable with your material, start writing. You may begin to experience some resistance at this point. Many times, in my own experience, I come up with a new idea, so compelling and powerful that I want to stop what I’m doing and just jump into the new idea. Don’t. Take out a notebook or a piece of paper and simply write it down in two or three pages. Write as much as you want about the idea, then put it away and go back to completing Act III.

				If you experience any resistance, doubts, or judgments, or feel that you’re “burnt out,” just “bend with it” and acknowledge it. Continue writing. Always keep your resolution—the solution—firmly in mind.

				If you want to change any of the details of the ending, do it. If your ending comes out different from what you want it to be, write it one way, put it away in a drawer somewhere, and then write it again; this time it will be the way you want it. If you’re writing a comedy and it comes out serious and dramatic, write it down, stick it in a drawer, and then write it as a comedy. The same with a drama; if it comes out funny, continue to write, knowing it’s only a form of resistance. When you’ve finished and it’s out of your head and out of your system, stick it in a drawer somewhere and forget about it, then go back and write it the way you want to.

				What’s important is to create a resolution that is honest and entrenched in the integrity of your story line. If you try to figure out what “they” want, what you think the public would like, or what the production companies would like to see in order to sell your material, forget it; it’ll never work. There’s no way you can “figure” out what “they” want. Just write your screenplay from the position that this is your screenplay and this is how the story is resolved and this is the ending you have chosen for now.

				It can always be changed later—when you do the rewrite.

			The Rewrite


			 				Maya: So what’s your novel about?

				Miles: Well, it’s a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. It’s kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely…It shifts around a lot…And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative and then it evolves—or devolves—into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery—you know, with no real resolution.

						Sideways





			Many years ago, I was driving down Sunset Boulevard with a musician friend of mine visiting from London when we saw a huge billboard showing a gorgeous California blonde sunning herself at the beach. Standing on the sidewalk below the billboard was a young man who was holding a little girl, maybe two or three years old, by the hand. It was a beautiful scene. As we drove by, I heard my friend mutter, “I am a child.”

			I knew it was a line for a song. He reached into my glove compartment, pulled out an old envelope, grabbed a pen, wrote down the line, added a few more words, hummed a musical phrase, and in that moment the entire song came to him. It took him only a few minutes to write down the lyrics.

			When we got back to my house, he sat down at the piano and began to play various phrases tying it all together. About 10 minutes later he said “listen to this” and he played the song’s musical line for me. It sounded good, even though it was rough and somewhat sketchy.

			Several days later he called and invited me to meet him at a recording studio in Hollywood. He was going to record the song, he told me. As I walked into the studio, I saw a huge orchestra on the stage, a number of backup singers, and a major recording artist. They started their rehearsals, and I heard the full song performed for the first time.

			Needless to say, I was blown away. From a few scribbled lines on an old envelope to this intense musical experience within the space of a little more than a week! I couldn’t believe it. I was jealous as hell; I wished I could write a screenplay or a book like that. I left the studio filled with a sense of wonder mingled with a layer of personal resentment and a lot of self-pity. When I think of the hours, the days, the weeks, the months, and in some cases, the years, of arduous and tedious work that goes into writing a screenplay or a book, it’s no wonder I felt the way I did.

			I wished I could write a screenplay that way, but it’s not to be. Oh sure, I’ve heard stories of screenwriters who write a script in a week, or two, and they may all be true—but what you don’t hear is how long they must have worked on the idea and characters and plot before they sat down to actually write the screenplay.

			That musical experience with my friend haunted me because I was measuring his experience of writing that one particular song against my own experience of writing a screenplay or book. And I knew there was no way I could measure his songwriting experience against my own writing experience.

			The more I thought about it, the more I saw that writing a screenplay is composed of many individual stages and they’re all different. Each phase is totally separate and unique. You may get a flash of inspiration for a screenplay in a few moments, but executing it is a quite different story. Writing is a detailed, step-by-step process, a day-by-day progression, and you move through it in stages, making it better and more complete as you go along.

			It’s only natural. Science teaches us that. The scientific method since the time of Francis Bacon deals with measuring things or making tests which involve experimentation and measurable results. A scientist will try different things, exploring each possible alternative intelligently and systematically, always keeping a record of what works and discarding what doesn’t.

			So many people I talk to share with me that they don’t like the idea of having to rewrite their material. After all, they’ve spent many months working on this first words-on-paper draft and feel that any changes that may need to be made should be authorized by someone who is going to buy or produce the script. In other words, they should be paid for rewriting the material.

			Nothing could be farther from the truth. The old adage “writing is rewriting” is a truism, like it or not. Rewriting your screenplay is a necessary and essential part of the screenwriting process; it corrects the changes you might have made during the first words-on-paper draft, and clarifies and defines your story as well as sharpening your characters and situation. You want your screenplay to be the best that you can make it—otherwise why spend all this time writing it? It would be easier not to do it at all. Whether you like the idea of rewriting or not, at some point you’re going to have to do it; you can’t argue with it, you don’t need to fight it. Just accept it because that’s just the way it is. Nobody ever told you that writing a screenplay was going to be easy.

			When you complete your first words-on-paper draft you know you’re going to have to make changes. That’s a given. Your screenplay is a living thing and it changes and grows from day to day. It is a process, and what you write today may be out of date tomorrow and what you write tomorrow may be out of date the day after the day after tomorrow. Don’t expect creative inspiration to be your guide because you’re going to be changing and correcting a lot of what you wrote the first time around.

			Writing the first-draft screenplay is done in three distinct stages: the first stage is writing the words-on-paper draft, which you’ve just finished; the second stage is writing what I call the “mechanical” draft, where you correct any changes made during the writing; and finally, the third stage, which I term the “polish” draft, where you’re polishing scenes and sequences until you’ve done the best job you can and the first draft is completed.

			When you finish the first words-on-paper draft, you’re ready to begin the process of rewriting. First, take a couple of days off to think about what you’ve done. What parts do you think work the best? What doesn’t work? Are your characters fully fleshed out? Do you know already what changes you want to make? Just let these thoughts “cook” a little bit. You don’t need to make any clear-cut or defined decisions at this point.

			The first thing in the rewriting process is to see what you’ve actually got. At this stage, you may not even know or remember what you did in Act I. It’s easy to forget that when you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm; you have no sense of overview, no objective perspective about what you’ve done or not done.

			You need some kind of an overview. You’ll need to clarify your “take” on the material. You want to see what you’ve written with objective eyes and not be burdened with any subjective comments, likes or dislikes, judgments or evaluations. You need to “unplug” from your subjective view to gain an “objective” overview.

			The way to do that is to read the entire first draft in one sitting from beginning to end. Lock up all pens, pencils, notes, and papers, shut the computer down, and just jump in and start reading. Resist the temptation to write notes in the margins about the changes you want to make. This exercise is for you just to read what you’ve got. It’s the best way to gain objectivity.

			As you’re reading the screenplay you’ll notice you’re on a roller coaster of emotion. You’ll read a scene and think to yourself how bad it really is, how could anybody write such drivel?; or, this is the worst thing I’ve ever read; or, the incidents and events of the story are so unbelievable and so predictable, nobody will believe it. You’ll feel totally depressed. Just keep reading. Then, you’ll read a scene you’ve written and think it’s not too bad, and then you’ll find another scene that works really well. Certain scenes you’ll see are way too long and talky, but they can always be cut and trimmed. You’ll be swinging on a pendulum of emotion, shifting between elation and despair. Just ride the roller coaster and don’t get too plugged into your emotional response, whether it’s despair, depression, or suicide. Just read the material.

			It’s easy to get distracted. One my students, a well-known actress, had completed her first words-on-paper draft. Late one night she called after she had read her script through for the first time. No sooner had I picked up the receiver than I heard her scream in my ear: “How could you let me write this…this piece of shit…it’s awful!” and she burst into tears and banged the phone down forcefully. I looked at the phone, not sure how to react or what I should say or do. So I did nothing.

			Later, she told me that after she read what she had written, she threw the script down in total despair, called me, then crawled into bed, turned the electric blanket up as high as it would go, and assumed the prenatal position with thumb in mouth. She stayed that way for two days.

			She overreacted, of course, and often, when you read something you’ve written, it can be a devastating experience. If this happens to you, just ride it out. I waited about four days before I finally called her back because I knew she was going to have to deal with all those “unreal” expectations and emotions she had suffered. We talked at length about it and she shared that she was numb, she didn’t feel anything at all. I suggested she wait a few days before she confronted her material again and “just do what you have to do to make it work.”

			When she finally did sit down to rework the material, she told me she felt like a machine, with no emotion at all. When she was able to move from a subjective view into an objective overview, when she didn’t react to any of her judgments and expectations, and just concentrated on writing her story, it turned out very well. It took her about two weeks to regain her confidence. After all, she had taken her idea, formed it into a story line, then written and completed a first words-on-paper draft. That’s quite an accomplishment.

			So, when you finish this first reading, take some time to think about it. Contemplate your overall feelings about the story, the characters, and the action. As you begin to mentally “cruise” through the progression of the story line from beginning to end, you’ll move into an overview position to balance the characters and the relationships that exist between them.

			Is the story set up correctly? What about the relationships between the characters? Are they believable? Do they talk too much, or explain too much? Are the conflicts and obstacles your character confronts during Act II clearly defined? Do parts of the second act drag and sag? Does your ending work effectively?

			Is there anything you would like to change?

			Think about it.

			After you read it, the next stage in the rewriting process is to sit down and write three essays, using free-association or automatic writing. Writing these essays allows you to unplug from the material and provides an effective overview. Each essay should be a couple of pages long; what’s important is to let the ideas flow naturally and spontaneously. Don’t try to force your story line to conform to your own expectations.

			The First Essay. Answer this question: What was it that originally attracted me to this idea? What was the idea that attracted you to commit your time and energy to writing this screenplay? Was it the situation of the main character that appealed to you, or was it the dramatic premise, or the situation the character was in? Think about it. If you go back to that moment when you felt the first creative “tug,” try to define what it was that attracted you to the material. If need be, close your eyes and see if you can recall that first moment you felt the urge to write this story. Let your thoughts roam freely and don’t try to censor anything at this point. You’re looking for that one moment of inspiration, that aha! feeling, that originally attracted you.

			Then, in this first free-association essay, throw down all the thoughts, words, or ideas that you think attracted you to the idea. Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation; just throw down your thoughts on paper or in the computer. When I do this exercise, I write in longhand, in fragments, just as it comes to me, without any logical order. It is a process of free-association. Just try to capture what it was that attracted you to the idea. Do this in two or three pages. Do not censor what you write; just let it flow naturally and spontaneously. Write this up in a couple of pages and when you finish the first essay, go on to the next.

			The Second Essay. Answer this question on a separate sheet of paper: What kind of a story did I end up writing? We usually start out to write one thing and during the process it often changes and we wind up writing something slightly different than what we originally intended. For example, you may start out to write a courtroom thriller but after you finish the first words-on-paper draft it actually turns out to be a strong romantic thriller set against a tense courtroom drama. Or you may start out to write a romantic comedy that ends up being more like a drama with comedic overtones. James L. Brooks, who wrote and directed Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News, wrote I’ll Do Anything as a musical comedy, but the music didn’t work, and when he removed the music it didn’t work as a comedy either. During the process of writing it’s very common to start out to do one kind of story and end up doing something slightly different. So go into the story you’ve written and see how it relates to your original idea. What did you set out to write, and what did you end up writing?

			Again, write the essay in one or two pages in free-association. Just throw down your thoughts, words, and ideas in free-association.

			The Third Essay. Take a new sheet of paper and answer this question: What do I have to do to change what I did do, into what I wanted to do? For example, you may have wanted to write a love story with a strong action-adventure theme, but you ended up writing a strong action-adventure played against the backdrop of a love story. Or vice versa. So, you have to change these elements. Look at The Constant Gardener—a thriller with a strong love interest; the female lead is killed early in the story. The screenwriter, Jeffrey Caine, had to create the love story through a series of complicated flashbacks; we see his wife through the husband’s efforts to find out who was responsible for her death. In the same way, you may have to strengthen and set up more of the action-adventure elements, and tone down the love story.

			In any case, you’re going to have to change and rework what you originally set out to do. Sometimes, what you end up with is much better than what you started out to do. That’s fine, but it still means you have to go back into Act I and the First Half of Act II, to set up and smooth out the story line so you have one fluid line of action.

			In other words, intention must equal the result.

			Again, this essay is written in free-association. Above all, you want to infuse your story with MDV, maximum dramatic value. So, what do you have to do to change what you did do into what you wanted to do? It may be that you need to add four or five new scenes in Act I, possibly remove a few scenes that don’t add anything to the story or that simply don’t work now, and set up the dramatic premise a little earlier. You may have to focus on your character, expand his or her characterization, perhaps even create a subplot with some of the minor characters. Now is the time to define what you want to do to implement these changes.

			What’s so important about these essays is to get clear on what you’ve written, so you can make it better. The best way to approach the rewrite process is by working in sections, or units, of dramatic action. That means working in Act I until you complete this unit of action. Then stop and work on the First Half of Act II. Define, change, add, or drop scenes, trim the dialogue until the Mid-Point. Then stop. Go into the Second Half of Act II and do the same thing. This way, the material does not become overwhelming and you can be more in control by working in sections, in units of dramatic action. Do the same in Act III.

			Now, on this second, or “mechanical” draft, reread the material in Act I but this time you’re going to be making notes in the margins: scenes you may want to change, dialogue you would like to add, or scenes you want to cut. Some scenes will be okay the way they are; some will not. Any dialogue changes, scene changes, or shifts in action, plot, or character, will need to be integrated into the script as a whole.

			We had mentioned earlier that dialogue has two possible functions: either it moves the story forward, or it reveals character. Keep this in mind. When you’re working with dialogue, it’s interesting to note that the word itself comes from the Greeks and it means “a flow of meaning.” Keep this in mind as you’re writing; is your dialogue flowing smoothly, or is your script “too talky,” or too explanatory? Are you sacrificing character for action, or action for character? You’ll want to open up your story visually, utilizing both INT. and EXT. locations, telling your story with pictures and words.

			Continue rewriting until you complete the Plot Point at the end of Act I. Always remember the context; you are setting up your story, setting up your characters and relationships, as well as establishing the dramatic premise and situation.

			Each unit is a separate and complete unit of dramatic action. You’ll find yourself doing more rewriting in Act I and the First Half of Act II. These two units of action are usually where you need to make the most changes, because that’s where your story started to change. Check it out. See if that’s accurate. In most cases, you’ll be rewriting almost 80 percent, or more, of this First Act material. So what? Just do it.

			You’ll find rewriting Act I will be easier than you thought. Why? Because you’ve already established your writing discipline, and you know the story and the changes you want to make, so writing them should be natural and easy. Sometimes you might have difficulty deciding what to do, especially if Act I is too long. If that happens, you might need to cut a few scenes and move them from Act I into Act II. Structure is flexible, right? Or, you may want to enter each scene at a later point in the action and end it earlier. (If you would like more guidance, read Chapters 9–11 in The Screenwriter’s Problem Solver.)

			As mentioned, this second draft is what I call the mechanical draft, meaning this particular stage of the rewrite is more about getting it down on paper than being clever and original. It’s “mechanical” because you just want to get the script in shape with a consistent narrative line, laying down scenes and dialogue which you know are not perfect but are used as a stepping-stone to the final, polish stage. This is where you are equalizing the story from what you started out to write and shaping it to fit what you did write. Usually, I just throw the scenes down to get them on paper, and don’t worry about how good or bad they are. I’m just smoothing things out, mechanically. You’ll correct any changes you made during the first words-on-paper stage, bring the script to the proper length, tighten up the dramatic tension, and sharpen the focus of your main character.

			Even though you’re going to possibly change a lot of things, perhaps rewriting 80 to 85 percent of Act I, maybe 50 to 60 percent of the First Half of Act II, 25 to 30 percent of the Second Half of Act II, and about 10 or 15 percent of Act III, don’t think of this as a “creative” draft. This draft should not take the same time or effort required as when you were confronting the blank sheet of paper in the first-words-on-paper draft.

			Concentrate on telling your story visually. You may find that you have the tendency to tell most of your story in dialogue. Maybe you’re “talking” your story, explaining the character’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions. For example, your character may be driving a car, see a jewelry store and say “I need a jade ring,” and explain why she needs the ring. Then you might show her walking into the store and looking at the rings while she tells the salesperson exactly what she’s looking for and why. She’ll purchase the ring and then you might cut into the next scene, where she is showing off her new jade ring at a party. That’s basically a scene of explanation. You don’t want too many of those.

			Instead, you can show the same thing visually: she sees the store, enters, and then cut into the next scene at the party where she is now showing off her new ring. Woody Allen did something like this in Match Point. We’ve seen Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) caught in his emotional dilemma; he doesn’t know how or what to tell his wife, Chloe, (Emily Mortimer) about Nola (Scarlett Johansson) being pregnant with his child. Then, one night, he suddenly wakes up, eyes wide open as he realizes what he has to do to resolve the situation. He doesn’t say anything and we don’t know at this point what his plan may be. But at the moment he wakes up, he suddenly knows how he’s going to get out of his predicament. That silent, unspoken moment is the Plot Point at the end of Act II. And in Act III, we then see how Chris solves his particular “problem.”

			Think visually, continually being aware of any cinematic transitions you might use as you move from one scene to the next and always looking for ways to enter and leave the scene. Enter late and get out early. Transitions are always a good way of cutting down the material, if that’s something you need to do.

			If you like, when you finish Act I of this mechanical draft, go back and clean it up. Polish a scene or retype some pages, cut out a few lines of dialogue to make it clearer and tighter. Don’t spend too much time on it; it’s important to move forward through the screenplay. Always work from beginning to end, beginning to end.

			Move on to the First Half of Act II. Reread the material and make extensive notes in the margins on what you need to do to make it work, until you reach the Mid-Point. You’ll find you might be changing about 60 percent of the First Half. Determine what changes you want to make. Then, if need be, lay out this section on 3 × 5 cards, just like you did with the Act I material.

			Always keep in mind your sub-dramatic context and strive for conflict, either internal conflict or external, or both, whatever works most effectively. Make sure Pinch I is clean and tight and the Mid-Point clearly defined. Sometimes, you may find that you have too many characters and need to condense two characters into one character; or use the first part of one scene on page 40 with the last part of the scene on page 55. Whatever you need to do to make your story work, do it.

			Does your Mid-Point still work effectively? Is it too long or too short? Too wordy? Or does it need exposition, action, or visual clarification? Do you need to redefine it visually? Again, just write it down. It doesn’t have to be perfect at this point.

			You’ll probably spend a week or two rewriting the First Half of Act II. After you’ve completed the Mid-Point, you can stop and move on to the Second Half of Act II. Read it through. Make notes on any changes you want to make. If need be, and if you feel comfortable doing it, you may want to restructure the Second Half on fourteen 3 × 5 cards just like Act I and the First Half of Act II. Sometimes you’ll feel like doing this and other times you won’t. You be the judge. You’re clarifying and redefining your story line so you want to make it as concise and visual as you can.

			Once you know what you need to do, execute it simply, keeping the dramatic context and time frame clearly in mind. You probably won’t have to change more than 25 to 30 percent of the Second Half of Act II. Just keep your story on track as you follow your main character through the action, setting up Pinch II and then moving on to Plot Point II. This section may only take you about a week or so to complete, depending on how much time you can devote and what you need to do.

			When you finish Act II, don’t spend too much time polishing the material. You’re going to be doing this the next time around, in the third and final “polish” draft.

			When you reach Act III, you’ll really be home free. You know the resolution of your story, you’re in a good creative flow, and any changes you’ve made earlier in the material should have already been paid off in this unit of action. Rewriting this part of the screenplay is usually the easiest and takes the shortest amount of time. You’ll feel like you’re almost done. In Act III, you’ll be cleaning up and refocusing the resolution, and you’ll want to look for ways to add any new visual dynamics to make your ending stronger and more effective. Here’s where you may have a better idea for your ending, and if that’s the case, change it. Now’s the time. You may want to write a new dialogue scene or make it more visual, but first you’ll want to make sure you have resolved your story line. The actual writing process itself at this time is pretty clear-cut and manageable and you’ll probably know exactly what you need to do to finish this second draft of your screenplay.

			You should be able to complete this “mechanical” draft of your screenplay in about four to five weeks, and it should end up being anywhere from one hundred ten to one hundred twenty pages, no longer. Bringing it to the proper length should be one of your first priorities. If you’re a first-time screenwriter, defined as someone who has never had a screenplay produced or purchased, they (whoever “they” are) are not going to accept a screenplay from you that is longer than one hundred twenty to one hundred twenty-five pages long.

			Sorry to be the one to tell you this. Your story line needs to be clear, with all the necessary changes fused into an organic story line from beginning to end, within one hundred twenty pages. The average screenplay today is approximately one hundred twelve to one hundred twenty pages long.

			When you complete this mechanical draft, take a few days off. Do what you want, but give yourself some time to digest the changes you’ve made. And then, you’ll be ready to move into the third stage, the “polish draft” of your screenplay.

			This is where you’ll really be writing the first draft screenplay. You’ll be polishing, accenting, and texturing each scene, changing a word here, a word there, a sentence here, a scene there, sometimes rewriting a scene up to ten or fifteen times to make it right.

			You’ll still be working in units of dramatic action, Act I, First Half and Second Half of Act II and Act III, but you’ll be approaching each scene with the lens of a microscope. You’ll go into each scene, analyze it, maybe cut this line, or move that line from the beginning of the scene to the end, lift one or two lines from the middle of the scene and tighten, condense, and polish the scene, word by word and line by line. You may be removing or tweaking lines of description as well. You want to make this “the best read” you can.

			One of the rules I created for myself when I was writing screenplays is that no descriptive paragraph should be more than four sentences long. I know that’s an arbitrary statement, but I’ve read so many scripts that had “thick,” “dense,” “bulky” descriptive paragraphs of half or three-quarters of a page. You want lots of white space on the page because that’s what a professional screenplay looks like. If you want to see what a professional screenplay looks like, get any screenplay, and read it. Just Google screenplays online and it will guide you to a number of sites where you can download scripts. You’ll notice how the descriptive paragraphs are lean, tight, and visual without too much explanation.

			Sometimes, you’ll find you may want to remove an entire character and give his or her lines to another character, so you don’t have so many people on the page that the text becomes confusing. Oliver Stone told me once that when he wrote the first draft of Platoon, he had twenty-six characters in the first ten pages. You can’t do that. You want to keep the action and character lines flowing simply and smoothly.

			In this polish stage, after going over a scene five or ten times to make it right, you may find that it still doesn’t work. As you ponder this dilemma, you’ll realize that you might have to move three lines from a scene in Act I into another scene in the First Half of Act II. Or, you might bridge one scene with another scene, and drop a nice transition because it doesn’t really work that well. You may telescope scenes, meaning you take one scene from the First Half of Act II, and combine it with another scene in the Second Half of Act II, thus establishing an entirely new scene that says the same thing in a shorter time. Remember the purpose of the scene: either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the main character. If your scenes do not satisfy at least one of these two requirements, then cut the scene. You don’t need it.

			You’ll be noticing certain rhythms of action, and possibly see places where a simple “pause,” or “beat,” before a character speaks will strengthen the dramatic tension of the scene. You’ll change: “he glances at the woman sitting across from him” to “he regards her questioningly.” You’ll sharpen visual images by adding adjectives, tightening and condensing dialogue by cutting words from speeches, sometimes whole sentences, occasionally chunks of dialogue.

			Again, work in units of action. First, complete Act I, then the First Half of Act II, the Second Half of Act II, then Act III. Working in units like this allows you to control your story and move forward, step-by-step, toward the resolution.

			Good structure, remember, is like the relationship between an ice cube and water, or fire and its heat. As you’re polishing your screenplay, you’ll smooth the structural line until the incidents, episodes, or events that anchor the story line won’t even be noticeable.

			The key words are: tighten, trim, condense, polish, cut, cut, then cut some more. Most new writers don’t like to cut words—or paragraphs—but you have to be ruthless. If you’re wondering whether you should keep a scene, a specific line of dialogue, a descriptive paragraph, or a sequence, chances are that you’ll cut it.

			There is only one purpose in this third, or polish draft, and that is to make what you’ve written into the best screenplay you can.

			How do you know when your rewrite’s done?

			It’s a difficult question, a hard call. You’ll never really know for sure, of course, but there are certain signs to look for. First of all, understand that your script will never be perfect. There will always be a few scenes that don’t work. No matter how many times you write or rewrite a certain scene, it may never be the way you want it to be. Sometimes, you’ll just have to let those scenes go. No one will ever notice that they don’t work or measure up to your expectations.

			You might also find that you’re spending a lot of time on minor changes. You may change “but there are signs,” to “and there are signs.” That’s a sure sign that you’re ready to stop. That’s when you can lay down your pages and say, “It’s done. I’ve completed the first draft of my screenplay.” That’s when you can let it go. It will either stand or fall on its own.

			At this point, I might suggest that you give your first draft to one or two people you trust. Personally, I would not suggest giving your script to your loved ones, or significant other. Why? Because out of their love, kindness, and friendship for you, they’ll want to be as “honest” as they can; after all, you’re putting your trust in them to let them read and evaluate your material. So, out of their love for you, they’ll be ruthless; they’ll tell you that this character is dull, flat, or the premise doesn’t work and the dialogue is thin and weak. All your worst fears will be realized when you ask your loved ones to comment and critique your material. You’ve got to trust me on this one.

			For example, in one of my screenwriting classes, I had a woman who was blessed with a wonderful sense of humor and a naturally wacky and unique style. She had never written a screenplay before but had an idea she wanted to write into a comedy. So, she came to class and went through the process. She laid out her subject line, developed her characters, and then wrote the four-page treatment. Then, feeling insecure about what she had written, she gave it to her husband to read. Now, her husband happened to be a very gifted film composer who had worked in Hollywood for years. He read her treatment and out of the “goodness of his heart, out of love for his wife,” he wanted to be totally honest with her.

			And guess what happened. In the name of love, he literally crucified her. Your characters are weak, he told her; the plot is mundane; no one would ever believe the situation. And you know, in his mind, he thought he was doing the right thing. He really wanted to protect her from the harsh realities of Hollywood and didn’t want her to get hurt. She listened politely to what he had to say, then took the treatment, put it in a drawer somewhere and never looked at it again. To this day, she has never picked up that story line or sat down at the computer to make another attempt at writing the screenplay. And, it was a good story that had a lot of potential.

			From that experience, I tell people not to give their material to a loved one, or spouse, or significant other for feedback; just know that out of their love and affection for you, they’ll confirm your worst fears. Or, they’ll tell you how much they like it and you don’t know whether it’s the truth or a lie. We’re all so insecure anyway we never really, truly know whether what we wrote is working or not. And you don’t want anybody telling you what you already know.

			Especially in Hollywood. Most of the time nobody tells you the truth anyway. They might say something like, “I like it but it’s not really something we want to do at the present time,” or, “we have something like this in development,” or “we’ve already done that movie.”

			That’s not going to help you. You want some feedback; you want someone to tell you what he or she really thinks about your script, in terms of what’s working or not, so choose the people you give this first draft to very carefully.

			After they’ve read it, listen to what they say. Don’t defend what you’ve written, don’t pretend to listen to what they say and then leave feeling righteous, indignant, or hurt.

			See whether they’ve caught the “intention” of what you wanted to write about. Listen to their observations from the point of view that they just might be right, not that they are right. They’ll have observations, criticisms, suggestions, opinions, and judgments. Are they right? Question them; press them on it. Do their suggestions or ideas make sense? Do they add to your screenplay? Enhance it? Or, didn’t they get it?

			Go over the story with them. Find out what they like and dislike, what works for them and what doesn’t. At this point, you still can’t see your screenplay objectively. If you want another opinion, “just in case,” be prepared to get confused. If you give it to four people for example, they’ll all disagree. One person will like the relationship, another won’t. One person will say they like the robbery, but not the result of the holdup (they either get away or they don’t); and the other one wonders whether you couldn’t strengthen the relationship between the other characters.

			Having too many people read your material just doesn’t work—at least, not at this stage. You want initial feedback from two people you know you can trust, who will be totally honest with you. When you’ve made all the changes you think will make the screenplay better, then you can send it out into the world through a literary agent, or producer, or production company, or attorney, or anyone you can get it to.

			It’s either going to stand or fall on its own. It’s not going to be “perfect.”

			“Perfection is an ideal; it exists only in the mind, not in reality,” Jean Renoir said.

			Believe it.


				THE EXERCISE

				Are you ready? Let’s do it.

				First, sit down and read the words-on-paper draft from beginning to end in one sitting; take no notes, just sit down and read. You’ll be on a roller coaster of emotion. Don’t fight it, don’t deny it, and don’t try to “reason” things out. Just keep reading. You’ll be making changes in your head, and that’s okay. You’ll swing between despair and elation, so enjoy the ride. When you’ve finished reading, take a day or two to digest your experience.

				Then, using free-association, write the three essays in a couple of pages each. The first essay you’re writing answers the question: What was it that originally attracted you to the idea? Just throw down words, thoughts, and feelings as you recall your first spark of inspiration and why you wanted to write the screenplay. Don’t judge or evaluate your answer; just throw it down. You want clarity and insight here, so you don’t have to worry about grammar, spelling, or the correct sentence structure. This is only an exercise for you, no one else.

				When you’ve completed this first essay, write the second essay: What kind of story did you end up writing? You may have wanted to write an action-thriller but you ended up writing a romantic thriller. Define and articulate what kind of a story you ended up writing. Do this in a couple of pages of free-association. Just throw down your thoughts, words and ideas. Don’t limit or censor yourself.

				When you’ve completed the second essay, write the third essay. Answer the third question in a couple of pages: What do I have to do to change what I did do, into what I originally wanted to do? As mentioned, what you ended up doing may be a better script than what you originally wanted to do. So what do you have to do to change it? You may need to set up the characters more forcefully, or strengthen the relationships, or open it up visually. This is an exercise that clarifies what you need to do make your script a good read.

				After you’ve answered the three questions you’re ready to move into the actual writing.

				Start with Act I. Read it as a unit of dramatic action and take notes, either in the margin or on a separate piece of paper. Structure and correlate any new scenes with the old scenes written, and then, if need be, lay out your new Act I structure on fourteen 3 × 5 cards. Go over the cards until the flow of action feels comfortable to you, then begin writing. Your first few pages may be stilted and awkward; it’s okay, don’t worry about it. This is only the “mechanical draft.” You may be changing anywhere from 80 to 85 percent of your material. Don’t worry about it. Just do it.

				Work in units of action. The whole process of rewriting this first act could take a week or two. Don’t worry if your work feels stilted, or episodic; just lay out your story line focusing on the threads of your story.

				Then move into the First Half of Act II. Read this unit of dramatic action, make notes in the margins, and, if need be, restructure it on 3 × 5 cards. Then, start rewriting, one scene at a time, one page at a time, through Pinch I to the Mid-Point. You may be changing 50 to 60 percent of the material in this unit. Be clear on your sub-dramatic context, and what you need to do to smooth out the story line.

				As you write the Mid-Point, be sure the focus of your story is clear and defined. Then move into the Second Half of Act II. Use the same process; read the material, take notes, structure it on 3 × 5 cards if needed, then start writing. In this unit of action, you’ll only need to change about 40 to 50 percent of the material. Just change what you need to change; don’t worry about rhythm, tension, or transitions in this “mechanical” stage.

				Move into Act III. Bring it to length, and make all the changes needed for a consistent story line. Check your ending. Does it work as effectively as you want it to? Or, do you need to modify it somewhat, perhaps even change it radically? What’s important is that it works; do what you need to do to make it the best ending you can.

				When you’ve completed this “mechanical” stage of the screenplay, move into the “polish” stage. Again, work in thirty-page units of dramatic action; polish, hone, clean, tighten, accent, cut, and shade your material.

				Your name is on the title page, so do the best job you can.

				Remember, a screenplay is a reading experience before it becomes a film experience.

			The “Good Read”


			 				 					Red: “I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain…I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams…I hope.”

				 					 						—Frank Darabont

						The Shawshank Redemption





			 				During my time as the head of the story department at Cinemobile Systems and Cine Artists, our film production company, I read more than two thousand screenplays and at least one hundred novels in my search for material. Since that time, some twenty-five years ago, I have read and evaluated thousands and thousands of screenplays. And in all that time, I have found only a few that were worthy of film production. And yet, in spite of my newly acquired cynicism, I pick up every new screenplay with the hope that this is going to be the one that will knock me on my ass. Believe it or not, I want that to happen—badly. Talk to any reader in Hollywood and he or she will probably tell you the same thing.

			I am always looking for the “good read.”

			What is a “good read”? I don’t know how to define it exactly, I can only say that it is a dynamic reading experience that hits me with a visual style that unfolds in pictures. It “looks” a certain way, it “reads” a certain way, and it “feels” a certain way. A good screenplay works from page one, word one. Chinatown is a good read; so are The Shawshank Redemption, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Lord of the Rings.

			What attracts me immediately is the way the words are put down on paper: crisp, sparse, and visual. I can tell whether the story is set up in the first few paragraphs. Does it open with a dynamic inciting incident? Does it grab my attention? Are the characters appealing, well-rounded, and three-dimensional? Is the premise and situation set up with insight and clarity in the first ten pages? Is there enough information presented to captivate me so I want to continue reading? Or is the story cluttered with too many characters, dense plots, and subplots?

			When I find a “good read,” I know it; there’s a certain excitement and energy that grabs me immediately, from page one, word one. What I’m looking for is a writing style that moves the action across the page like lightning. Where I can’t help but keep turning pages, which, of course, is the screenwriter’s function—to keep the reader turning pages.

			And this, believe it or not, is the contradiction: nobody likes to read in Hollywood, yet everybody loves to read a good screenplay.

			That’s just the way it is. Things never change in that respect.

			Why? Because there are so many poorly written screenplays; perhaps one out of a thousand is worthy of moving up to the next level of the executive chain. And when you find a “good read” everyone wants to read it, so it is faxed and emailed to development executives all over Hollywood.

			So, what does the reader look for when he or she is evaluating the material? Several things. I thought it would be interesting to illustrate the reader’s process when he or she is given a script to read. Every screenplay submitted goes through this same journey. If you are submitting a script to a studio or production company, this is what most likely will happen.

			When the material is submitted, either by an authorized literary agent, or attorney, or producer, or director, it’s given to a reader to read. (Unsolicited material is usually returned unread due to various legal issues.) The reader reads the script, then he or she writes up a short, detailed synopsis and offers his or her personal opinion of the material in a couple of pages. This is referred to as coverage. Coverage is a tool for the film executive who doesn’t read the material but has to respond to the person who submitted it, either agents or producers or directors. Coverage includes the name of the writer, the particular genre, a logline (a brief, one-sentence description of the story), and various checkpoints on a chart which indicate the reader’s judgment regarding the quality of material in terms of structure, character, story, dialogue, and overall writing ability. It is broken down in terms of: excellent, good, fair, and poor. I’ve taken the liberty of summarizing a reader’s evaluation from a major film company and it’s a pretty good reflection of what the reader looks for when assessing the material.

			In this example, I’ve avoided using any names and titles. First, in the upper left-hand corner, there is the title, the author, and the genre, a one-word description of the type of story: action-adventure, love story, western, comedy, romantic comedy, farce, romance, drama, science fiction, animated, or futuristic. In this particular example, the genre is a romance with sad ending.

			Second, there is a brief summary of the story, a logline, a four- or five-line description of what the story is about; in this instance the synopsis reads: “A beautiful, ambitious young attorney schemes to get ahead in a Chicago-based law firm. Her boss, married with three kids, falls in love with her. She subtly demands to be made a full partner, which ruins him politically. His marriage on the rocks, he leaves to start his own firm, making her a partner. Within weeks, he’s begging his wife to take him back. Our girl steams ahead.”

			That’s what the story is about; it is the subject of the screenplay. (If you want to read good loglines, read the movie synopses in TV Guide. It’s a good example of the way you need to “pitch” your story line.)

			Third, after the logline, there is a one-and-a-half page detailed synopsis of the story, in depth and detail, which I have omitted.

			Fourth, there is the reader’s analysis, with structure and character emphasized. In this particular evaluation, the analysis is broken down into specific categories:

			 				 					 						I—Character



				 					 a) Design: 					 A ruthless young career woman takes advantage of a middle-aged husband and father, and he abandons his family for her.

				 					 b) Development: 					 						Almost good. The author must have it in for women. This is one of the bitchiest portrayals since Fatal Attraction, All About Eve, or Body Heat. The characters just don’t ring true. They’re not full enough.

				 					 						II—Dialogue



				 					 					 						Fair. This may be Chicago but it’s very small time. The dialogue here makes the cardinal sin of making everything obvious. The story is all told in dialogue.

				 					 						III—Structure



				 					 a) Design: 					 A Lolita with brains works her way up the ladder in the legal world by manipulating her boss, a family man, and then dumping him once she’s accomplished her primary goals.

				 					 b) Development: 					 Fair. Because it’s all so obvious and soap-opera–oriented. The main character has no depth, and she’s an unsympathetic character.

				 					 c) Pacing: 					 Good. Though there’s no doubt about what’s going to happen next, and very little dramatic tension. But it doesn’t drag either.

				 					 d) Resolution: 					 Poor. The script suddenly ends. We are left up in the air. The poor husband goes crawling home and we never see the main character again.

			 			 				That’s a brief summary of the analysis and evaluation of the reader’s coverage of this particular screenplay. Then there is a Reader’s recommendation, where the reader adds his or her impressions in a few sentences. In this case, the screenplay is: “Not recommended. A mediocre romantic drama in every respect. It’s the unsympathetic portrait of a pushy, midwestern career woman. The ultimate point of the whole thing remains a mystery. It’s downbeat, and totally without the black comedy textures one associates with others of the type. It’s a cornbelt soap opera, not a feature film.”

			As short and curt as this coverage is, it is what every studio executive, agent, and movie producer reads to form their opinion.

			You might ask yourself what the reader is going to say about your screenplay. If you look at it from the reader’s point of view, there’s always another script to read; usually the pile on the desk is about two feet high.

			Today, more people are writing screenplays than ever before and the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking has become an integral part of our society and culture. Last year some seventy-five thousand screenplays and teleplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East. Out of all these, some four hundred and fifty films were produced, either in Hollywood as major studio productions, or by various independent film companies. You do the math.

			Within the next few years, the number of people writing for the visual media will probably double and triple in size. And it’s only going to expand exponentially as the evolution/revolution of technology impacts the world and the way we see things. It seems this is the only time in human history where we have created a technology which our children are teaching us how to use.

			Today, we are entering a new phase of visual storytelling. The two most popular majors on college campuses are business and film. And the dramatic rise of computer technology and computer-graphic imagery, along with the expanded influence of MTV, reality TV, iPods, Xbox, PlayStation, new wireless LAN technology, and more, are shaping an international cinematic revolution. Already, we are making short films on our cell phones, so we can email them to friends and family, then project them on plasma TV monitors. Clearly, we have evolved in the way we see things.

			My two nephews, aged ten and eight respectively, made a surprise birthday video on their computers for their father that displayed an incredible understanding of storytelling with pictures. Needless to say, I was knocked out. They were thinking visually in new ways, fusing an understanding of their source material into a little six-minute film that utilized photographs, video, computer graphics (self-made), live interviews, music cues, and old family footage, and integrated them all into a remarkable visual experience.

			The marketplace for the screenwriter is changing drastically and the need for new directions in terms of visual storytelling is in its infancy. Right now, television programming is being made and distributed specifically for our cell phones and iPods. Already, companies are looking to produce specialized material for the vast number of markets that will be available.

			The vast constellation of Hollywood production companies is also changing to fit the needs of these new technologies. It won’t be too long before the entire motion picture and television market will be something other than what it is today. No one knows exactly what this market will be, domestic or international, but one thing is certain: the opportunities for the screenwriter and visual storytelling will be enormous.

			If you’re serious about writing a screenplay, now is the time to sharpen your skills and perfect your craft.

			The future is now.

			A lot of people tell me they want to write screenplays. They call me, write me, badger me, finally join a workshop, then two or three weeks later drop out without a word. Their commitment, to themselves and their writing, is zero. Action is character; who a person is is what he does, not what he says.

			If you’re going to do it, do it.

			That’s what this book is about. It is both a guide and a tool. You may read this book a hundred times, but until you put it down and do the exercises and deal with the blank sheet of paper, you’re only going to be thinking about writing a screenplay and not actually writing it.

			It takes time, patience, effort, and commitment to write a screenplay. Are you willing to make that commitment to yourself? Are you willing to learn and make mistakes? To do some terrible writing? Are you willing to do the best job you can even if it doesn’t work? The things you try that don’t work will always show you what does work.

			What’s really important about writing a screenplay is doing it. First, set yourself a goal, then create an intention about what kind of writing experience you intend to create for yourself. Then do the exercises at the end of each chapter, one at a time, and soon you’ll achieve what you set out to do. That’s what this is all about.

			In my workshops, after people complete their first-draft screenplay, everybody applauds. It is our acknowledgment of the time, dedication, and commitment to the work they have done, along with the toil, effort, pain, and joy that goes into the writing experience.

			The Screenwriter’s Workbook is a guide that leads you through the screenwriting process. The more you put in, the more you’re going to get out. That’s a natural law.

			“True art,” Jean Renoir once told me, “is in the doing of it.”

			Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it, or you don’t.

			It’s your choice.





			 				To all those who went before

				and to all those who follow…

				and

				To all the great Siddha Saints and Masters—

				always in my heart, always in my mind…





			A SPECIAL THANKS

			 				To Jean Renoir for pointing out the path through the forest; to Michelangelo Antonioni and Sam Peckinpah who guided me along the path; and Tony Gilroy, an extraordinary screenwriter, for his generosity, insight, and creative spirit; and to my students, the world over, who taught me everything I needed to know.

Introduction


			When I first started thinking about writing this book, I wanted to find some kind of tool that the screenwriter could use in order to recognize and define various problems of screenwriting. But as I began writing, I became aware that I was really writing about the solutions to various problems, and not really identifying them. It just didn’t work. So I began to rethink my approach. To solve any kind of a problem means you have to be able to recognize it, identify it, and then define it; only in that way can any problem really be solved.

			The more I began thinking about the “problem,” the more it became clear that most screenwriters don’t know exactly what the problem really is. There’s a vague and somewhat tenuous feeling somewhere that something is not working; either the plot is too thin or too thick; or the character is too strong or too weak; or there’s not enough action, or the character disappears off the page, or the story is told all in dialogue.

			So I began analyzing the Problem-Solving process. The only way I could make this book work, I realized, was to recognize and define the various symptoms of the problem, very much the way a medical doctor isolates the various symptoms of his patients before he can treat the disease.

			When I approached the Problem-Solving process from this point of view (and it is a process), I began to see that there’s usually not just one symptom, but many symptoms. It soon became clear that many of the problems in screenwriting share the same symptoms, but the problems themselves are different in kind; only when you analyze the context of the problem can a distinction be made, and it is those distinctions that lead us on the path of recognizing, defining, and solving. For the truth is that you can’t solve a problem until you know what it is.

			With that in mind I began to understand that there are only three distinct categories of The Problem; when you’re writing a screenplay, all problems spring either from Plot, Character, or Structure.

			The art of Problem Solving is really the art of recognition.

			You can look at any problem in two ways: the first is to accept the fact that a problem is something that doesn’t work. If that’s the case, you can avoid it, deny it, and pretend it doesn’t exist. That’s the easy way.

			But there’s another way of approaching the problem, and that’s to look at any creative problem as a challenge, an opportunity for you to expand your screenwriting skills.

			They are really both sides of the same coin. How you look at it is up to you.

			“The World is as you see it.”

			The Art of Problem Solving


			A few weeks ago, during one of my screenwriting workshops, a student turned in some pages from her screenplay with a somewhat worried and concerned expression on her face. I didn’t say anything, I simply took the pages and read them.

			The scene she had written took place at the beginning of the Second Act, as the main character, a lawyer, is investigating the mysterious and unexpected death of her mother, who had died while recovering from a simple surgical procedure in the hospital.

			Stunned and grieving, she is trying to find out why her mother had suddenly died, but no one has any answers, and no one is talking. The doctors placate her, the nurses know nothing, and the hospital administrator is concerned and suggests she join a grieving group. Her grief turns to anger, and she’s determined to find out what happened. Pursuing lead after lead, she manages to locate one of the nurses who had taken care of her mother right before she died. The nurse had mysteriously quit the hospital a few days after the mother’s death, had changed her address and literally disappeared. But through her own persistence, and some lawyer friends, she manages to track the nurse down. And now, she’s going to talk to her.

			This was the scene my student had just written. As I read her pages, I began to get some insight into why she appeared to be concerned about it. She had written the scene like an interrogation; the main character questions the nurse, who is reluctant to say anything about her mother’s death.

			This was an important scene, and it had to be handled in such a way that it both moved the story forward and revealed information about the main character. She’s tough, feisty, and smart, and she’s not just going to accept what happened, but she’s determined to find out why it happened. And this scene is the first real clue the main character has which confirms her suspicion that some kind of cover-up is going on. Somebody made a mistake here, and because of it, her mother is dead.

			I waited until the people in the class had finished reading the pages, then I turned to the young woman who had written the scene, and asked, “What do you think?”

			She was very quick to answer. “I think something’s wrong,” she said, “it just doesn’t feel right.”

			She was right. She had a problem.

			Problems are common in screenwriting. The old expression “Writing is rewriting” is very true. But in my experience there are two ways you can look at a problem:

			The first is to say that a problem is something that doesn’t work. Very simple.

			The second way is to say that a problem is an opportunity, a challenge that will allow you to ultimately improve your craft of screenwriting.

			Two different points of view. But any way you look at it is the same: a problem becomes the fuel of creativity. You either view it as an obstacle or an opportunity; either a problem is something that doesn’t work, or an opportunity for you to move up to another level.

			It’s up to you.

			For some people the simple knowledge that they have a problem in their script can create a panic attack; it’s a horrible, much-to-be-dreaded experience.

			I have traveled all over the world conducting screenwriting seminars and workshops, and I hear the same thing in country after country; screenwriters describe their scripts in terms of the problems they are encountering. “Well,” they say, “my problem is that my structure’s not working,” or “my character’s weak,” or “the dialogue’s flat.”

			And I tell them there are no problems, there are only solutions. They laugh at that, because they think I’m kidding. But I’m not.

			I think what scares most screenwriters, or anyone for that matter, is that most of the time they know there’s a problem, they just don’t know what it is. They can’t define or describe it. It exists only as a vague sense of discomfort, an imprecise dissatisfaction, a knot in the gut or a lump in the throat.

			My student knew, or felt, she had a problem with these pages, she just didn’t know what it was. The art of Problem Solving means being aware of those hazy and undefined feelings, and using them as some kind of a guide to lead you into an examination of the cause or source of the problem. The art of Problem Solving is really the art of recognition.

			In my student’s case the main character, the lawyer, has knocked and entered, and she and the nurse have a dialogue scene. The scene was smooth and well written, but the overall effect was really somewhat dull and boring. Basically, talking heads. That’s not screenwriting. That’s playwriting. There was no sense of threat, no tension. And when I read pages that are slow and boring, the first thing I do is look for the source of conflict. And in these pages there was hardly any conflict at all.

			I wanted to find out what her feelings were about the scene, so I looked at her for a long moment, and then asked, “What do you think?”

			“I think something’s wrong,” she replied, “something’s just not working.”

			“Like what?” I said, wanting to get specific.

			“Oh, I don’t know. It just feels like there’s something wrong.”

			“So what do you think it is?” I persisted.

			She thought about it for a moment, then said, “I think it’s soft; it feels fuzzy.”

			Soft and fuzzy.

			That’s a pretty accurate description. It lets you know that something’s not working as well as you think it should. And if you don’t pay attention to that little “itch,” that little “soft and fuzzy” feeling, the chances are it could evolve into a much larger problem later on.

			Writing a screenplay is such a specific and demanding craft that when something doesn’t work, whether a scene, or sequence, or character, it casts a long shadow across the page. It becomes the seed that will erupt into a full-blown problem later on. So it’s important to catch and take note of these symptoms as they occur.

			If you feel you have a problem, and can’t articulate or define it, there’s not much you can do to fix it. That’s just a natural law. You can’t fix something if you don’t know what’s wrong with it.

			When you get down to it, the art of Problem Solving is the art of recognition. And it is a definite skill that relies on the writer’s sense of recognition and self-awareness. If you feel there’s a problem—maybe the script is too long, too talky, or the characters are too weak or too thin—what can you do to fix it?

			Nothing. At least not until you can accurately describe it. Until you know what the problem is, all you can do is piddle around with it; you can’t fix something until you know what’s wrong with it. There are many screenwriters who piddle around with a problem without fixing it, and it will probably remain as one of those scenes that never seem to work, no matter what you do. And you just let it go and hope no one notices it.

			It happens all the time. The ostrich syndrome.

			But if you know how to define and articulate the problem—maybe the main character is too passive and seemingly disappears from the action, or is too unsympathetic, or maybe the dialogue’s too direct—you’ve got a handle on it and you can solve it to the best of your ability.

			So, in this process of what we call Problem Solving, how do we go about fixing “soft and fuzzy”?

			First, define the problem. That means generally rethinking the material. Go back into the material; analyze your intentions. What is the purpose of the scene? Why is it there? What is the character’s dramatic need—what does your main character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay?

			It’s usually something that can be described fairly simply; in Thelma & Louise (Callie Khouri) it is their need to escape safely to Mexico. In Dances With Wolves it is John Dunbar’s dramatic need to go to the farthermost edge of the frontier and adapt to the ways of the land and the people.

			So, what is your character’s dramatic need? Define it within the context of the scene. If you can illuminate this dramatic need—either through action or dialogue—you gain more subtext and texture, and thus add more dimension to the scene.

			The first step in Problem Solving means to rethink the needs of a scene; you must take it apart in order to isolate and define the emotional forces working on, and within, the dynamic of the scene.

			The scene is the living cell, the hub of dramatic action, and serves two basic functions in the screenplay. One, the scene moves the story forward; or, two, reveals information about the main character. These two elements of story and character must be served in each and every scene, visually, if possible. Look at any scene in any screenplay, study any movie, and see whether this is true or not. It’s very common to read the pages of a screenplay and find pages and pages of extraneous scenes devoted to incidents or encounters that have absolutely nothing to do with the story line.

			By definition, a screenplay is a story told in pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure. This is something I never get tired of repeating, because for some reason we always seem to forget it. Each scene always has to move the narrative line forward, from beginning to end, beginning to end, even though it’s not necessarily in that order, as illustrated by Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino), or Courage Under Fire (Patrick Shane Duncan), or The English Patient (Anthony Minghella, beautifully adapted from the book by Michael Ondaatje).

			The scene my student wrote, which she could only describe as being “soft and fuzzy,” is really a key scene that moves the story forward. But the way she wrote it was not sharp enough; the dialogue was too nice, too direct; there was no tension, no subtext working, and it washed out. There was not enough definition or dimension in it.

			So I had her redefine the character’s dramatic need. In this particular scene the character’s dramatic need is to find out any information she can about her mother’s sudden and mysterious death. Was there any wrongdoing? A mistake of some kind? Why did the nurse suddenly quit and leave the hospital? Is there a cover-up going on? What’s happening here?

			These are all important questions within the context of the scene. And context, remember, is the space that holds something in place. It is the space inside the glass that holds the content—water, coffee, tea, milk, beer, soft drink, grapes, nuts or raisins, whatever—in place. The space inside the glass does not change: it holds the content together. It is the gravity of the scene; it is context.

			I knew my student had to make the scene sharper, more defined, with more tension, and the only way to do that was by generating more conflict. So I made some suggestions: maybe the nurse is not at home when the main character arrives. Maybe the first thing she has to do is wait. Maybe in her car. Maybe a couple of hours. This provides a back story to the scene. It lets the character enter the scene with some built-in tension.

			So let’s add some more conflict. The main character has had to wait a couple of hours. So what else can we do to create conflict in the scene? What if the nurse has a boyfriend, and maybe the guy’s not too bright and he lets the main character, the lawyer, into the apartment before the nurse arrives home. He assumes they’re friends. So she could already be in the house when the nurse arrives home.

			These elements would add a great deal of conflict to the scene. The nurse arrives home, she’s pissed at her boyfriend for letting a stranger, the lawyer, in, and we can see by her defiance and attitude that she’s frightened. For sure this woman knows what happened to the character’s mother and does not want to say anything about it, for whatever reason. Maybe she’s even preparing to leave town. But she’s tough and doesn’t want to give anything away.

			What does that do to the scene? Obviously, it sharpens the dramatic forces within it. What had been soft now shows more potential for tension and conflict; there’s an edge to it.

			And there’s a way to get even more out of the scene; throughout this book I’m going to be referring to the value of writing short essays about your story and characters, defining and expanding events and relationships. Even though the nurse is a minor character, she is important to the story, and therefore becomes an important scene in the story development and cannot be “fuzzy” in its execution.

			I suggested that she sketch in the nurse’s life. What exactly did she see in the hospital? How much does she know? What actually happened? I told her to create a step-by-step series of events from the nurse’s point of view that led up to the death of the lawyer’s mother.

			Once that was done, I had her define the relationship between the nurse and her “boyfriend.” There might be more subtext that could be mined for maximum dramatic value. So I had my student write a short free-association essay about their relationship. Simply to sharpen the elements of the scene. Where did the nurse meet him, how long have they been together, is it a serious relationship? Or maybe it’s over; maybe they’re getting ready to separate. The answers to these questions allow you to expand the dynamic forces working from within and without the scene.

			These are steps that need to be taken so the dramatic elements that are necessary to drive the story forward can be heightened and defined.

			She went back to the “drawing board,” did the exercises I suggested, and began to see things from a different perspective. She created more possibilities for her screenplay by simply listening to her feelings of discomfort about what was wrong with these pages.

			Throughout the cycles of history and literature, there have always been attempts to define the art and craft of writing, about what it is and how it works. To me, writing is all about asking questions and then waiting for the answers. The answers will always be there and in most cases will reveal themselves in a totally unexpected way. That’s part of the wonder of the writing process.

			Aided by these written exercises, my student was able to go deeper into the scene. She began to see it differently. She saw, for example, that when she first wrote the scene the interaction of her characters was vague and hazy, soft, and clarified that by redefining the dramatic need of the main character.

			“What is character but the determination of incident?” Henry James, the great American novelist, wrote. “And what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			So let’s take this to another level. We all know that drama is conflict. Without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story; and without story you have no screenplay. You only have a succession of incidents and events that flows to its conclusion. It looks like a story, it acts like a story, but there’s really nothing there but a bunch of hooks, gimmicks, or special effects.

			Die Hard With a Vengeance (Jonathan Hensleigh) is a good illustration of that. The only thing we know about the Bruce Willis character is that we find him drunk in a van somewhere, and he hasn’t seen his estranged wife for a year or so. And he’s the one who’s hauled out of his stupor to find and capture the “mad” bomber. Later, of course, we find out that a few years before, the Willis character was responsible for the death of the bomber’s brother. Ho-hum. There’s no focus on character here at all, only on the originality of the action sequences, which are simply strung together in a random and chaotic manner. Look at all those plot twists!

			I wanted my student to sharpen her dramatic focus. In order to understand the forces of conflict working on the nurse in this scene, I suggested she do another exercise; that she write the scene from the nurse’s point of view. In other words, if this story was about the nurse, if she was the main character, how would she react if she knew something about the incident, something she didn’t want to reveal to anyone, and then the victim’s daughter came snooping around, trying to find out information about what happened?

			Changing the perspective of the scene like this, merely as an exercise, helps clarify and sharpen the character’s point of view, and thus brings the dramatic conflict into bold relief.

			That’s what she did. And it opened up a whole new awareness in her writing. The rewritten scene became clean, sharp, and tight; there was subtext and context and it moved the story forward in a charged and highly dramatic fashion.

			And it all started from her discomfort, from a little tug in her gut and her awareness that the scene was “soft and fuzzy.”

			There’s an old adage in the film industry that states, what you try that doesn’t work always shows you what does work.

			The art of Problem Solving is the art of recognition.

			Either you look at a problem as something that doesn’t work, or you look at a problem as being a challenge, an opportunity to expand your screenwriting skills.

			It’s up to you.

			So, What’s the Problem?


			How many times have you read something you’ve written and then gotten that strange feeling in your gut: you know there’s something wrong but you just don’t know what it is? You go over and over the scene or sequence, again and again, examining it, reexamining it, trying it one way, then another, and still it doesn’t work.

			What do you do? How do you go about trying to fix something when you don’t know what’s wrong with it? How do you go about isolating and defining the problem?

			What is the problem? You may know something about it; the scene is too slow, too wordy, too boring, or the main character is a little weak, or there’s too much action going on, or the ending may be a little slow, or a little too rushed, but you have no idea how to fix it. Are you able to see the problem? Can you define it, take it apart, articulate it? How do you go about sketching it out, isolating it?

			Before you can solve any creative problem you’ve got to know what the problem is. And that means you’ve got to rethink and possibly reorganize whatever it is that needs to be fixed.

			That means literally rewriting it. You’ve all heard the old expression “Writing is rewriting.” Well, it’s true. I tell that to writers all over the world and they panic: “You mean I’ve got to rewrite it?” they moan. The answer is yes. Yes, yes, yes. Sorry.

			I’ve just been working with one of my students preparing a screenplay to submit to directors and actors, and he’s gone through at least fifteen rewrites. He had to change almost the entire Second Half of Act II, altering subplots, removing some characters, and taking out a lot of fat that was really unnecessary to the story line.

			The word rewrite means “to revise and correct,” and that’s exactly what must be done when you’re hunting for a problem. Whether you’re rewriting the entire screenplay, or an act, or a sequence, or just a scene or shot, the process of Problem Solving is the same; you’re trying to recognize and define it, hunting for clues as to where it is and what it is. It becomes The Problem.

			So, what’s the problem?

			There are times when you know what it is immediately, maybe the scene’s too talky, or too “preachy,” too specific or direct, but while you may know what it is, you don’t really know enough about it to fix it.

			That’s where the process of rewriting comes in. The first thing you need to do to clarify and define the problem is to put it into a context, a window, so you can outline the parameters of whatever it is that’s not working, whether it be a character, scene, or sequence.

			The best way to do that is to do a written exercise. Sit down, take a piece of paper, or go to the computer, and in a couple of pages just throw down any thoughts or ideas you have about the problem. Free-associate; ask yourself the question “What is the problem I am looking for?”

			It’s important to remember to begin each question with the word what. Try to phrase the question in such a way that it begins with the word what. Not why. If you ask “why” something is not working, you’ll get eighteen different answers and they’ll all be correct.

			But structuring a question that begins with the word what implies a specific response. And that’s what you’re looking for, something specific.

			Check it out.

			This is basically a kick-in-the-ass exercise; when you start throwing down thoughts and feelings about the problem area and what you think the problem is, you are beginning a creative process that sets you out on the path of the problem-solving mode.

			It doesn’t matter whether your thoughts and observations are correct or not. Just sit down and write this little free-association essay: “What do I think is wrong with this scene, or sequence, or act?” You don’t want to get too general and ask yourself what’s wrong with the screenplay. Let whatever comes up, come up. What you think the problem is, regardless of whether it’s right or not. Just ask yourself some basic questions about the material. Free-associate by writing down any thoughts, words, and ideas about what you think is working and not working.

			What do you think you can do to make your story stronger, to improve it, to make it more dynamic? What does your instinct tell you? Listen to it. There are many nights when I know something is wrong with what I’m writing but I can’t put a handle on it, I can’t really define it, so I may do a “dream assignment.” Before I go to sleep, I ask my creative Self to reveal in a dream something that will help clarify what it is that’s not working. And most of the time I’ll have a dream that night that illuminates something in dream language about what it is that is not working, and what I might be able to do to fix it. And there are times when I won’t have any dream at all, and then a few days will pass, then I’ll get a sudden insight into what the problem is and how to solve it.

			I firmly believe that if you created the problem, you can solve it. Therefore, you have to look inside yourself for the answers.

			Problems only exist so they can be solved. It doesn’t really matter how you do it. The solution could come to you in a dream, or while driving the car, running in the park, or even cooking dinner. The answer will be there when you least expect it.

			All you have to do is look for it. Trust yourself.

			Let the answer come in its own time. Sometimes the answer comes easily, and sometimes not. That’s the wonderful thing about it; you never really know when you’ll get a solution, or what it’ll be; just know you’ll get it.

			Problem Solving is part of the creative process.

			So what’s the problem? Read over the pages you think are not working and see if you can isolate or define the problem. Maybe your story doesn’t follow one line of action, but goes off in several different directions at once. Or maybe too many things are happening to your main character. For example, your main character may be a cop, but you think you should show more about his partner, so you write some scenes about his partner, and pretty soon you’ll find you’ve created an entire subplot that gets in the way of the story; or maybe you want to show the bad guy being “badder,” so you keep adding scenes showing just how bad he is; that happened in Die Hard With a Vengeance. It’s an easy way to “fill” the story but only succeeds in getting in the way. By spending so much time with other characters, you’ll ultimately end up losing your main character and your story will probably end up going all over the place, in several directions simultaneously. The real problem is losing the focus on the main character, and that’s who your story is really about.

			Sometimes, when screenwriters don’t know what to do next, or what happens next, they’ll simply add a new character to the story line. Rather than working to develop the dramatic context of the scene, story, or character, or expanding the action, all they do is add a new character. But that won’t work because it’s really a problem of developing story, not character, although one always reflects and incorporates the other.

			Or maybe you read your pages and decide that you have too many characters in the story, or that your main character is too passive, too reactive, and seems to disappear into the background while a minor character pops up and takes over the story line.

			What is your story about? And who is your story about? That’s what always has to be kept in mind.

			So, do this little exercise where you free-associate about what the problem is. It’s important to remember that when you do it, you’re rereading pages with the awareness that you’re looking for something that’s not working. Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas in free association; you don’t have to worry about grammar or spelling (nobody’s going to see this but you), so just throw it down without regard to how good or how bad it is, or whether it’s right or wrong. Don’t make any judgments about your writing or what comes up; your judgments tend to censor and smother your creativity if you listen too closely.

			So what are you looking for?

			There are only three things you can be looking for: Plot, Character, and Structure. Those are the only three areas where you can have a problem. The entire story can be broken down into these three areas, and they become the hub, or means, of the Problem-Solving process. If you look at any problem in the screenplay—whether the script is too long and talky, or there’s too much action and not enough character, or too much character and not enough action—whatever the problem, everything falls under the umbrella of Plot, Character, or Structure.

			So, what’s the problem?

			Is it a problem of Plot, of Character, or of Structure?

			That’s the starting point in defining any problem areas in a screenplay—or all writing, for that matter. What is it that’s not working? If a scene is not working, is it because of a problem of Plot, Character, or Structure? Is the material boring? Too talky? Does the scene, or action, move the story forward, or does it reveal information about the character?

			If the line of action wanders too far from the story, a solution might be to add elements that keep the story anchored and moving forward; so that’s an element of Plot. But in altering the plot you’ll also find yourself forced to restructure the material. Changes to the plot and structure will affect your character’s actions and reactions, requiring more adjustment. And that’s how you’ll fix it. All three areas will always be related to one another; only the approach differs.

			When you can isolate and define what’s not working in the screenplay, you’ll see that any problem will have some kind of relationship to these three areas. And that shouldn’t be so surprising. In life everything is related to everything else; nothing exists by itself alone, but only in its relationship to something else. So any problem in the screenplay will always exist in some relationship to Plot, Character, and Structure.

			And since you’re the one who identifies what’s not working, you get to choose which it is. It’s all the same ball of wax; we just pull it into three different parts so we can put it back together again.

			Many problems can be identified as problems of Plot. For example, is the dramatic thrust of the story line clean, lean, and defined? Or does it seem muddled and unclear? Is there too much happening, is it too detailed or specific, or is there not enough happening to keep the tension taut and flowing, uninterrupted by a lot of talking heads? In other words, is the action believable?

			Suppose you have a problem with the ending. Maybe it happens too fast, or maybe it’s not dynamic or big enough. What do you do? You have to expand it, broaden the action—so in order to solve your problem, you have to open up the ending, create more incidents that will expand the action, which means focusing more on the main character; once that’s done, then the material has to be restructured.

			Plot, Character, Structure.

			What happens if the character is too talky, and always seems to be explaining the situation, so it drags the action down? Are there too many characters that get in the way of the action? Does the dramatic line of action ring true, or does it rest on coincidence and contrivance? All of those flaws could be considered problems of Character. In defining the problem you might have to go back into the material and look for ways to make the character more active and energetic, and you can only do that by introducing some more dramatic elements. Then, of course, you would have to restructure the act and thread your character forcefully through the plot as if weaving him or her through a tapestry.

			In Problem Solving everything can be reduced to a variation of Plot, Character, or Structure. They act and interact and react upon one another just like the juggler juggling his three oranges.

			As soon as you are able to make a distinction, to isolate and define the problem as being one of Plot, for example, then you can begin to narrow it down. Suppose your ending, or a certain Plot Point relies on a particular story point or piece of information that seems contrived and predictable; if you think it’s a problem of Plot you’ll have to go back into the story line and introduce, or set up, an incident or event properly, an event that is naturally related to the story. In The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont), the murder of Andy Dufresne’s (Tim Robbins) wife is set up from page one, word one. The very first scene shows him sitting in his car, drinking whiskey and palming his gun, which is then intercut with the murder and his trial, and it’s this incident or episode that drives the screenplay through the story line. The entire story is structured around this incident, and comes back into play during the Second Half of Act II, when a young convict tells Andy that a previous cell mate told him that he committed the two murders and it’s the first time we wonder whether Andy really did kill his wife.

			If that incident had not been set up from the very beginning of the screenplay, the ending would not be as powerful as it is. Incidents or events like this have to be carefully introduced into the story line so the ending can be paid off, and made believable, and be executed with maximum dramatic value.

			The craft of screenwriting is a process of understanding the relationship between the parts and the whole, the relationships between Plot, Character, and Structure. All the elements of a story, the action, episodes, characters, location, music, special effects, Plot Points, are related to one another, just the way an ice cube exists in relationship to water. An ice cube has a definite crystalline structure, and water has a definite molecular structure, but when the ice cube melts into water, you can’t tell the difference between the molecules that made up the ice and those that made up the water. It is the same relationship that exists between a fire and its heat. The two only exist in relationship to each other. Each aspect reflects the other. It’s the same relationship between the story and the screenplay.

			Only after you’ve located the problem will you be able to define it. Can you determine whether the problem is one of Plot, Character, or Structure? That’s the start point. If you are unable to separate the problem out, try to define it as you see it: e.g., the main character is too weak, the dialogue too direct or boring. Then write the free-association essay and it will lead you into determining the nature of the problem.

			Only after you become clear on what the problem is, whether it’s Plot, Character, or Structure, will you able to clarify and define the problem.

			The next step is to locate the problem.

			Locating the Problem


			After you’ve determined what the problem is, the next step is locating it in terms of the dramatic story line to see exactly where it fits in the scheme of your story. That means locating it in terms of structure, where and when the problem occurs within the logical progression of events. It doesn’t matter whether the problem is Plot, Character, or Structure.

			Only when you identify the problem can you locate it. So identify it first, then locate it. Where the problem occurs becomes a major dynamic in terms of solving it.

			What’s the problem? Setting up and establishing your characters’ dramatic need? Is the Plot Point at the end of Act I a function of the story, or simply an event of convenience? Is the relationship between the characters clean, strong, and convincing? Is your story line anchored in terms of progression, either physical or emotional, and what about the character arc and the sequence of events?

			What’s so important about locating the problem is that it allows you to create a perspective about it; you can see the forces working within and without the story. You can chart the story like a navigational map to see the overall structure and enable you to discover those forces working on it at that particular point.

			So exactly where is the problem? In Act I, Act II, or Act III?

			Which brings us to an overview discussion of screenplay structure. A screenplay is a unique form; it is neither novel nor play, but combines elements of both. Structure is the foundation of all screenwriting, the spine or skeleton that “holds” everything together. William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Marathon Man, Maverick) declares that “a screenplay is structure,” and it’s true. Structure is the gravity of story, the road map through the desert. It is both guide and support, and flexibility is its nature, for structure is like a tree in the wind that bends but doesn’t break. The structural elements of a screenplay can be moved around and through the dramatic story line.

			Why is structure so important in the screenplay?

			The word itself means “to build, or to put together,” and “the relationship between the parts and the whole.” If you’re building a story through action, characters, and events, those elements have to be structured into a definite beginning, middle, or end, though not always in that particular order. And each of those units, the beginning, the middle, and the end, is part of the story, part of the dramatic (or comedic) story line. It’s the story that forms structure; structure doesn’t form the story.

			When you’re developing a screenplay, and building and putting it together into a series of related incidents, episodes, or events, it should be leading you to the dramatic resolution, the solution of your story.

			First you build it, then you structure it into its component parts, beginning, middle, and end, and it’s the relationship between the parts and the whole that make it an organic whole.

			Take a chess game, for example; that is the whole: but a chess game is composed of four individual and distinct parts, the pieces, the knights, king, bishop, queen, pawns, et cetera; the player or players, because somebody has to play the game; the board, because you can’t play chess without it; and finally the rules, because that’s what makes chess chess. Those are the four elements that make up the chess game. It is the relationship between the whole, chess, and its parts, the pieces, players, board, and rules, that makes a chess game what it is.

			The story is also a whole, made up of specific parts, the characters, actions, Act I, II, III, scenes, sequences, locations, music, special effects, and so on. It is the relationship between these parts that gives a screenplay its strength and integrity.

			A screenplay is a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.

			If we could see what a screenplay looks like, if we could hang it on the wall like a painting, it would have a particular form. To see what that form looks like, to see what its nature is, we use the Paradigm of screenplay structure. A paradigm is a model, example, or conceptual scheme. The paradigm of a table, for example, is a top with four legs. Within that paradigm you can have a small table, a large table, a narrow table, or a wide one, a square, round, rectangular, or octagonal one, a glass table, wood table, wrought-iron table, plastic table, or any combination thereof, and the paradigm of a table still holds firm; no matter how you bend it, change it, alter it, or twist it, it still remains a top with four legs. The form doesn’t change.

			Some people think the form of a screenplay is really a formula. Nothing could be further from the truth. The difference between them is simple, yet unique. A form is a space, or context, that doesn’t change. But the content that fills the form always changes. Take a glass. There is a space inside, and it’s this space inside that holds the content in place; the water, tea, soft drink, beer, milk, juice, or raisins or nuts, or grapes, whatever, but the space inside the glass doesn’t change; it holds the content in place, just as structure holds the different scenes, actions, locations, characters, and situations in place.

			The form of a screenplay never changes; like gravity, it simply holds everything together, all the parts of your story, whereas the content is always changing.

			That’s what the Paradigm is; the form of the screenplay. If a screenplay is a story told with pictures, what is it that all stories have in common? As mentioned, a beginning, middle, and end (though not necessarily in that order). In dramatic terms the beginning corresponds to Act I, the middle to Act II, the end to Act III.

			Here’s what it looks like:





			 				Act I is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately twenty to thirty pages long, and held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. Act I sets up the story, establishing who and what the story is about, as well as defining the relationships between the characters and their needs.

			Act II is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately sixty pages long, and held together with the dramatic context known as Confrontation; in this portion of the screenplay the main character confronts obstacle after obstacle in order to achieve his or her dramatic need. The dramatic need is defined as what the main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay. If you know the dramatic need of your character, then you can create obstacles to that need, and the story becomes one of your character overcoming, or failing to overcome, obstacle after obstacle in order to achieve his or her dramatic need.

			All drama is conflict; without conflict there is no character; without character there is no action; without action there is no story. And without story there is no screenplay.

			A Mid-Point occurs in the middle of Act II, about page 60, and it is an incident, episode, or event that breaks Act II down into two basic units of dramatic action; the First Half of Act II, and the Second Half of Act II. And it is the Mid-Point that connects these two parts of Act II. It is a link in the chain of dramatic action. A Mid-Point could be either a quiet moment, or a dramatic sequence; in Witness (Bill Kelley and Earl Wallace) it is a quiet moment in the barn when Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis are dancing and cannot mask the attraction they feel for each other. In Dances With Wolves (Michael Blake) it is the dynamic action sequence of the buffalo hunt. The function of the Mid-Point is to keep the story moving forward; it is a link in the chain of dramatic action connecting the First Half of Act II with the Second Half of Act II.

			This is what it looks like:





			 				Act III is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately twenty to thirty pages long, and held together with the dramatic context known as Resolution. Resolution means “solution.” What happens at the end of your story? Does your character live or die, succeed or fail, win the race or not, get married or divorced?

			Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution. Acts I, II, and III. But how do we get from the beginning, to the middle, from Act I into Act II, and then from Act II into Act III?

			By creating a Plot Point at the end of Act I, and a Plot Point at the end of Act II; a Plot Point is any incident, episode, or event that “hooks” into the action, and spins it around into another direction, in this case from Act I into Act II, and Act II into Act III. There are many Plot Points in a screenplay, but the ones that anchor the story line in place are Plot Points I and II.

			Act I is a unit of dramatic action that goes from the beginning of the screenplay to the Plot Point at the end of Act I and is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. Within this unit of action you’ve got to set up the story, establish the main character, and set up the dramatic premise. What is your story about? What are the forces working on the character to create the action? What are the relationships in your character’s life? You have to show this, and it must all be set up in Act I.

			Act I is a unit of dramatic action that can be broken down into three distinct sections; the first ten pages, second ten pages, and Plot Point I. Within the first ten pages three essential things have to be established: the main character (who your story is about), the dramatic premise (what the story is about), and the dramatic situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), all must be introduced and set up.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, for example, the first ten pages go like this: We open with Andrew Dufresne (Tim Robbins), parked outside a house, drinking. A lively tune plays on the radio. He opens up the glove compartment and takes out a gun. Then we cut directly to the murder trial, where Andy is on the witness stand being hounded by the prosecutor. We cut back to Andy sitting in the car, smoking, drinking, waiting, then cut inside a house where a woman and a man are wrapped in an erotic embrace, then back to the murder trial, where we learn that he is being accused of murdering his wife and her lover in cold blood, then back to Andy, and the sequence builds until we set up his arrival at the Shawshank Prison. We’ve set up who the main character is—Andy; the dramatic premise—he’s sentenced to “two life sentences” in Shawshank; and the dramatic situation—he claims he is innocent and didn’t commit the crimes.

			These three strands of narrative action (Andy inside the car, on the stand, and seeing his wife and lover) visually establish the dramatic hook, that incident or event that leads directly to Plot Point I, sometimes called the “inciting incident.” In Shawshank the dramatic hook is where he enters the prison, an incident that happens about page 10 in the screenplay. We don’t know anything about him, but we meet Andy Dufresne through the eyes and the voice-over narration of Red (Morgan Freeman); he bets the other cons a pack of cigarettes that Andy will not last the first night in prison without breaking down. But it doesn’t happen; someone else breaks down.

			It’s important to note that we enter the prison with Andy; we see it through his eyes and are introduced to the environment at the same time he is. Thus audience and character are bonded together in a dramatic connection; both learn what’s happening in the story line at exactly the same time.

			Andy’s entrance into prison sets up the second ten pages of the screenplay, where the emphasis is on following focus on the main character. In this case we follow Andy’s entrance into the prison through the voice-over narration of Red, so we see Andy’s life in prison from his perspective. He is the main character (it’s about him), even though Red has the larger part. So in these second ten pages we’re focusing on Andy’s entrance into prison, what his life will be like, and introduce the other characters who are part of his life during the course of the screenplay. We see the prisoners checking into prison, getting their clothes, hearing the lecture from the warden, being hosed down and deloused, then entering their cells.

			After setting up and establishing life in prison, it’s time to set up Plot Point I; about twenty-five minutes into the film, Andy approaches Red and says, “I hear you’re a man who can get things done,” then asks if Red can get him a rock hammer.

			That initial conversation begins their relationship and is the cornerstone of the film. That’s why the Plot Point at the end of Act I is always the true beginning of your story.

			Plot Point I is the incident that moves the story forward, into Act II, a unit of dramatic action that is approximately sixty pages long and held together with the dramatic context known as Confrontation. Act II begins at the end of Plot Point I and continues until Plot Point II, and in this part of the screenplay the main character will overcome obstacle after obstacle after obstacle in order to achieve his or her dramatic need—what the main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay.

			Everything in Shawshank Prison becomes an obstacle; whether it’s the prisoner who sexually pursues Andy relentlessly, or whether it’s just doing time, or the maggots in the food, or simply learning how to survive in the prison environment, the action of the story line continues to feed and develop the relationship between Andy and Red. Over the years they develop their own code of honor and become best friends.

			When you’re writing Act II, it’s very easy to become lost in the maze of your own creation. That’s why the Mid-Point becomes so important, for it connects the First Half of Act II with the Second Half of Act II, and is a link in the chain of dramatic action. The First Half of Act II deals with Andy learning “the ropes” of prison life, and the developing relationship between him and Red. And it is because Andy is a banker, an educated man, that he gains the trust of the warden and acquires the tools that will lead to his escape at Plot Point II. The Mid-Point, as mentioned, is either a quiet moment, or an active, dramatic sequence, that links the First Half of Act II with the Second Half of Act II. The First Half deals with gaining the trust of the warden, the Second Half deals with him having the trust that leads directly to the Plot Point at the end of Act II.

			In The Shawshank Redemption the Mid-Point is that brief moment when Andy receives a shipload of books (after six years of letter writing) and is given permission to create a prison library. In his elation and exuberance he plays Mozart over the loudspeakers and ends up doing another stretch in solitary.

			In order to build the First and Second Half of Act II, you need one major sequence to hold the action together. In the First Half it is a sequence that occurs around page 45, and in the Second Half of Act II it is a sequence that occurs around page 75; I call it the Pinch because it is an incident or event that keeps your story on track; it’s a little “pinch” in the narrative action that keeps your story on line and leads to the Mid-Point, or Plot Point at the end of Act II.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, Pinch I is the sequence where the warden has the prison guards strip Andy’s cell, but in reality it’s the warden’s way of checking to see whether Andy can be trusted for any kind of future financial advice. Once the warden approves, Andy is moved to the library, and soon the prison guards are lining up for some sound financial guidance. It is this incident that moves the story forward and keeps the story on track leading to the Mid-Point, which occurs about page 60.

			When you are locating your problem points you must find out where the problem occurs, and only then will you be able to find what the events leading up to the problem are and what the next story point is.

			This is how the screenplay of The Shawshank Redemption is structured: On page 10 he enters the prison; at Plot Point I he establishes a relationship with Red, and obtains the rock hammer, which leads to his tarring the roof and winning the trust of the warden at Pinch I, which allows him to start the library at the Mid-Point, then introduce the new prisoner, Tommy, at Pinch II in order to reveal that Andy did not really kill his wife and her lover, leading to the warden refusing to help him, and to the warden’s having Tommy murdered, and becomes the motivation for Andy escaping. Plot Point II.

			Act III is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately thirty pages long (although in today’s scripts it’s more likely to be about twenty pages) that goes from the end of Plot Point II to the end of the screenplay and is held together with the context of Resolution. In other words, the story must resolve itself, and resolution, remember, means “solution.” What is the solution of your screenplay?

			In Shawshank Andy has escaped. The story focuses on Red: first we see with Red’s voice-over narration how Andy escapes; then we see Red finally getting his parole and working for a while as a bag boy in a market. Unable to bear the constant fear, he decides that life would be better if he joined Andy in Mexico. He follows Andy’s instructions to Buxton County, and then we watch as he finds the stone fence and large oak tree, spots the black rock “that should not be there,” then digs until he uncovers the note and the money Andy has left for him.

			We follow Red on the bus, and then the end comes when he is walking along the beach in Mexico and he and Andy are reunited.

			Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution. Acts I, II, and III. Plot Points I, II, Pinches I and II.

			These incidents, episodes, or events are the structural anchoring pins of the story line. And this is the value of dramatic structure: it holds everything in place; it is the foundation, the skeleton, that holds the scenes and sequences, the action, in place. It is the Paradigm of dramatic structure.

			This is how it looks:





			 				When you know you have a problem with the script, when you can identify and locate it, you can place it within the structural story line of the story you are telling. And that means going back into the Paradigm, to identify and define it. Only then can you find the correct solution in order to build to that point by adding scenes, shots, or sequences to smooth out the action and keep it going. When you locate the problem on the Paradigm, then you can find out what you need to do to fix it.

			Before any screenwriting problem can be solved, it has to be put into the context of story.

			And that means locating it on the Paradigm.

			Approaching the Problem


			The only way to really approach the problem, whatever it might be, is to think of it as a rewrite. Writing is rewriting is the old adage, and it’s true. You may not like the rewriting process, but it is a process, and that means it continually changes from day to day. What you write or conceive today may be out of date tomorrow, and what you write and conceive the day after tomorrow is out of date the day after that.

			Screenwriting is a process, and it’s larger than you are. It is a living thing, just like a relationship, and it changes and grows from day to day. That’s just the way it is. Accept it and just do it.

			When you’re ready to deal with the problem, the first thing I suggest is to create an overview for yourself. Redefine and clarify your “take” on the material. See what you’ve written with objective eyes and try not be burdened with your subjective comments, or your likes and dislikes.

			To unplug from the material and put you into an overview mode, I tell my students, whatever country they’re in, to write three short essays, in free association, or automatic writing, not more than a page or page and a half, to see the material as a whole.

			But before you do these essays, you need to read the screenplay through from beginning to end first, in one sitting, with no interruptions or phone calls or sudden desires to wash the kitchen floor. You want no distractions at all. Most importantly, lock up all your pens and papers in the drawer. This is an exercise.

			As you’re reading the screenplay, you’ll notice some emotional shifts; you’ll read a scene and wonder how could anybody write this drivel; or you’ll think it the worst thing you’ve ever read, or see the incidents and events of the story as so outlandish that nobody would believe them. You’ll feel totally depressed; just keep on reading. Then you’ll read a scene you’ve written and think it’s really not too bad, and then there’s a scene that really works well. Certain scenes you’ll suddenly be aware of are way too long and talky, but you know they can be cut and trimmed, and you’ll swing on the pendulum of emotion between elation and despair. You’ll simply experience a roller coaster of emotion as you read through the material.

			When you finish your reading, take some time to think about the screenplay; contemplate your overall feelings about the story, the characters, and the action. As you begin to “cruise” through the progression of your story from beginning to end, you’ll balance yourself out and start to move into an overview position to see the relationships between the parts and the whole, the relationships that exist between Act I, Act II, and Act III.

			Think about what you’ve read. Is the story set up correctly? What about the relationships between the characters? Are they believable? Do the characters talk too much, explain too much? What about the conflicts and obstacles in Act II? Does the ending work?

			You can do anything you want. What would you like to change?

			Think about it. Just go through the story from beginning to end in terms of the action and the characters.

			Now do the three essays:

			The first essay. Answer the question What was it that originally attracted me to the screenplay? What was the idea that lured you to it? Was it a character that appealed to you, or was it the situation the character was in? Think about it. If you go back to that moment when you felt the first creative “tug,” what was it that attracted you?

			Then, in a free-association essay, throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas about what first drew you to the idea. Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation, just put your thoughts, words, and ideas down on paper. When I do this I write in fragments, just as it comes to me, without any logical order; it’s a process of free association. Just try to capture and define what originally attracted you to the idea.

			The second essay. Answer the question What kind of a story did I end up writing? In other words, we start out to write one kind of story and usually end up writing something different. For example, you may start out to write a courtroom thriller and it really turns out to be an action piece with a strong love interest. Or you may start out to write a strong dramatic piece with some humorous overtones and it ends up being both a drama and a comedy. James L. Brooks, for example, started writing I’ll Do Anything as a musical comedy, and the music part of it didn’t work, and when he removed the music it didn’t work as a comedy either. During the process of writing it’s very common to start out to do one thing and end up doing something else. So go into the story you have written and see how it relates to your original idea. Again, one or two pages, free association.

			The third essay. Answer the question What do I have to do to change what I did do into what I wanted to do? In other words, the intention must equal the result. Again, this is free association. You may find that you have to strengthen several scenes in Act I, maybe add four or five new scenes, remove a few, set up and establish the dramatic premise a little earlier. What do you have to do to change the material into what you want it to be? You may have to focus on your character and maybe create more of a subplot; whatever it is, what do you have to do to make the changes?

			It may be that what you’ve actually written is much better than what you started out to write. That’s fine, but you still have to go back into Act I, and the First Half of Act II, and set up your story with the maximum dramatic value.

			What’s important is for you get clear on what you’ve written, and how to fix it. These free-association essays will do just that. Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People, Julia, White Palace, among others) once described the process this way: “Turn out the lights and close your eyes. Write what your fingers want to say. Be free, as free as you can be. To make no sense is to find sense. Sense will always appear. Trust it to arrive. It is the core of nonsense. It is not about anything but about everything. The glitter gets lost and the truth comes through. And then, when the lights are up, you will sift through it as would a sifter of gold. The mud will be gone and you will find at least a golden kernel or two has been stirred up. Close your eyes. Then write….”

			Once you’ve identified the problem, the best way to approach it is by working in sections, or units, of dramatic action. Each act is a separate, individual, and related part of the whole; Act I is a whole because it begins at the beginning, and ends at the end of Plot Point I and is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up.

			The First Half of Act II goes from the beginning of Act II to the Mid-Point, and is held together with the dramatic context of the line of action. The Second Half of Act II goes from the end of the Mid-Point to the Plot Point at the end of Act II and is held together with the line of action. And Act III is a unit of dramatic action that goes from the beginning of Act III to the end of the screenplay, and is held together with the dramatic context of Resolution.

			Look at the Paradigm:





			Each is a separate and complete unit of dramatic action; all are related in Plot, Character, and Structure. Because each unit is a whole as well as a part, it proves to be an ideal vehicle in approaching any problem you might have, whether it has to do with Plot, Character, or Structure.

			So, what’s the problem and where is it?

			In Act I? If it is, then approach Act I as an independent and separate unit of dramatic action, a part of the whole. Take a look in the overview:





			 				Since the context of Act I is the Set-Up, how are you setting up the story in terms of character and action? Is your script action driven, or character driven? If you’re opening with an action scene, does it fully realize its dramatic function? What kind of sequence is it? A murder sequence, as in Jade (Joe Eszterhas), or a character-driven scene or sequence, as in How to Make an American Quilt, or a combination of both action and character, as in Apollo 13?

			If you’ve located the problem in the first ten pages, you may need to rethink and redesign this first ten-page unit of dramatic action. It’s here that you introduce your main character, state the dramatic premise, and establish the dramatic situation, the circumstances surrounding the action. Is the action strong enough, and the character revealed? How? Through an action or dialogue? In Dances With Wolves Michael Blake shows John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) stretched out on a table ready to have his leg amputated. But Dunbar, revealing an enormous sense of strength and courage, manages to force his way through the intense pain and pull on his boot. This one simple action, with minimum dialogue, shows us the very qualities of his character (strength and determination) that guide Dunbar’s journey of discovery and lead to his transformation on the frontier. We see his character through his behavior, and as mentioned before, film is behavior.

			As will be stressed throughout this book, everything is related to everything else in a screenplay; if you have to open up and redefine or restructure the story line and premise in these first ten pages, then you have to know that whatever changes you make, like sharpening and tightening the action or dialogue, will affect and change something else in another part of the script.

			For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction is Newton’s Third Law of Motion.

			Whether your story is about a person caught in a web of extraordinary circumstances, or whether you’re dramatizing an interior struggle, your character will be engaged in an emotional journey culminating in some kind of change in his or her thinking or behavior. You may feel your character needs to be better illuminated, so then you may find it essential to go back into your character biographies to define and redefine his/her relationships.

			You must take the time to set up the foundations of your story line through the action and the characters in this unit of dramatic action.

			If you feel the material in Act I is too slow, or not visual enough, check your physical location. Is there a strong visual arena? Are your characters talking, or explaining, more than necessary? Too much dialogue always slows the action down except when the story and situation play against each other, as in Pulp Fiction. Samuel L. Jackson is always spouting from the Bible in a way that is somewhat humorous, but then we learn he’s a professional killer. And he can quote from the Bible and pull the trigger in the same breath. And it’s this contradiction of character that makes the screenplay so effective and why Tarantino is such a gifted filmmaker.

			If your problem is in the second ten pages, and you are following focus on the main character, do these pages show his or her relationships in a way that moves the story toward Plot Point I?

			If you feel that the relationships are thin, or you introduce another character or characters, you may have to redefine those relationships by writing a one- or two-page essay on each character. This exercise allows you to bring a greater depth of character to the screenplay and establish stronger relationships between characters, because you now know these characters with a new and deeper understanding, “see” them in a new light.

			Maybe you want to create two lines of visual action by intercutting a new character with the main character. When you have two lines of dramatic action operating simultaneously, this could possibly weaken the thrust of the story. Just follow the character. If that’s the case, and the action is too weak for this opening unit of dramatic action, then you may have to cut out the other character and focus the action on the main character. Your story is always moving toward Plot Point I, so anything that does not further the action either has to be cut or rewritten. When you’re writing a screenplay, you have to be ruthless, especially when you’re in the process of solving a problem, even though you may feel you’re cutting the best things you’ve written.

			Just serve the material.

			Have you set up the Plot Point at the end of Act I? Have you executed the Plot Point as effectively as you can? Does it do the job? Are you clear about what it is? If not, you have to define it to yourself clearly, so you can set it up and render it dramatically. Whether it’s an action sequence, or a character decision, or even a change in locale, the Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story. That’s why you have to take so much time and be so careful in writing Act I. You have to be totally clear on who these characters are and the story line and execute it properly, so you can move into the First Half of Act II riding the crest of the story wave you have been setting up from the very first scene.

			In most rewrites in the Problem-Solving process it is not surprising to rewrite about eighty to eighty-five percent of Act I, either by sharpening or tightening the dialogue, or writing new scenes that bring the action into sharper focus, and being able to keep only a few scenes from the original pages. What’s most important in Act I is making sure enough visual and emotional information is given. If you need to do a major rewrite to solve a particular problem in Act I, then rethink this unit of dramatic action completely; take some three-by-five cards and restructure the story line on fourteen cards, writing one scene per card—though that is a contradiction when you are writing.

			If you feel you have a problem in Act II, you have to go through the same process; first you have to identify the problem, then locate it in the proper structural framework of the story line before you can actually move into the Problem-Solving process.

			First, where is the problem as you see it? In the First Half of Act II, or the Second Half of Act II? If the problem is in the First Half, where is it? Between Plot Point I and Pinch I, or Pinch I and the Mid-Point? If it’s in the Second Half of Act II, does it fall between the Mid-Point and Pinch II, or between Pinch II and Plot Point II?

			When you’ve isolated and defined the problem you need to be very specific, narrowing your perception so you can design a solution to the problem. It’s very important to find out exactly where the problem occurs because then you approach it from a structural overview and thus uncover and refocus the dramatic elements that lead up to the problem. When you take the problem apart like this you begin to see very clearly what you need to do to fix it.

			Remember, Act II is approximately a sixty-page unit of dramatic action that goes from Plot Point I to the end of Plot Point II and is held together with the context of Confrontation. The Mid-Point breaks Act II into two basic parts, the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II.

			Here’s what it looks like:





			The best way to slide into the action of the First Half of Act II is to make sure you enter a story line from the character’s dramatic need; what is it that your main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay? What is his or her motivation, or purpose, during the action of the screenplay? What is it that drives him or her through the action in Act II? These are questions you must be able to answer within the context of the entire screenplay.

			What is the theme of action in the First Half of Act II? Clearly define it to yourself. It derives from your character’s dramatic need. If your theme of action is adapting to the frontier as it is in the First Half of Act II in Dances With Wolves, then you can create obstacles to that need, and your story becomes your main character confronting those obstacles to achieve his or her dramatic need. The first thing that confronts John Dunbar is cleaning up Fort Sedgewick; once that is done, he begins adapting to the land; he begins his relationship with the Sioux, as it becomes essential here to expand and broaden the story line. This is his journey of discovery.

			If your problem is with the main character, he might be talking too much and slowing down the action, or the overall focus of the character may be too narrow or tight (for example, are you going from INT. to INT. to INT. in your scene construction?)—so you may need to open up the action visually, using different locations.

			Approaching the problem means you have the ability to go right to that particular section of the screenplay where the problem is, and begin the process by modifying some scenes, or writing new ones. In many cases you’ll find that you want to replace long and talky dialogue with a visual action, something that reveals character with just a little dialogue. That way you can keep the flow of the story moving forward, bridging both time and action from scene to scene, sequence to sequence. (More about this in Chapter 11.)

			The structural story points of Pinch I, Mid-Point, Pinch II, and Plot Point II, hold the action of Act II in place so that it is clearly anchored and defined within the context of story. In this part of the process you get to make a choice: Do you need to open up the action to make it more visual? Or can you modify the dialogue and make it work? Remember that the purpose of every scene or sequence is either to move the story forward or to reveal information about the character.

			So what do you need to do? Write it down. You may want to put this entire section of the First Half of Act II back on fourteen cards, card 7 being Pinch I. Or maybe you need to go into your character’s life and redefine his or her relationships in a short, one- or two-page, free-association essay on the character’s professional, personal, and private life; see if there’s anything there that you can extract and add to the content of the screenplay to open it up a little.

			The same principle applies to the Second Half of Act II, no matter what the problem is; whether it is Plot, Character, or Structure, first locate it on the Paradigm. Where is it? Is it between the Mid-Point and Pinch II, or between Pinch II and Plot Point II? Once you determine the location, then you can approach from that particular unit of dramatic action. First, be clear about the theme of action for the Second Half of Act II. Where does the problem occur? Then break it down into its developing structural line; what events lead up to this particular problem? What do you need to do to restructure the material? If need be, put the action line down on fourteen cards, then go through the same process you did for the First Half of Act II.

			The same thing with Act III.





			Where in Act III does the problem occur? Does it deal with the resolution of the story? Or is the ending too thin, or too short, or too contrived, or too predictable? Do you have to expand or open up the action in Act III in order to effectively set up the resolution? And what about your ending? If that’s the case, and you think the action’s too thin, you’ve got to go back into your structure of the Third Act and rebuild the action in such a way that the ending becomes the payoff to the entire script. Again, that means writing new scenes, as well as tightening and sharpening others, possibly even changing the point of view, depending on the specific problem.

			Is the ending believable? Does it happen too fast, or do you need more of a Set-Up? It might be that you need to create an entirely new ending in order to resolve the action effectively. Finding a new ending is very common in the filmmaking process. Not only is it a Hollywood practice to gauge audience response toward a particular ending, but screenwriters from all over the world go through the exact same process. An ending either works or it doesn’t; it either resolves the story line or it doesn’t. And sometimes you don’t know whether it works or not until you have gone through the entire screenplay.

			The important thing to remember in approaching the problem is that the process is the same; it doesn’t matter whether it’s a problem of Plot, Character, or Structure.

			Each unit of dramatic action can be broken down into its appropriate parts, effectively rewritten and restructured, and will provide a solid foundation in the process of Problem Solving.





Part I


			SOME COMMON PROBLEMS

			Talking Heads


			Recently I conducted a screenwriting workshop in Rio de Janeiro. Screenwriters from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Chile had been chosen by their respective ministries of culture to participate, and they had all come to Rio to attend the three-week workshop.

			It was intense. We met four hours a day, six days a week. The first week we spent preparing the material, and the second and third weeks we were writing up to ten pages a day. Sometimes more.

			It was difficult. The one thing they needed, I told them, was something they didn’t have—time. They didn’t have time to contemplate their stories, and nurture all those nuances of character; the only thing they could do was write, to throw down all those thoughts, words, and ideas that came to mind. That way they could push aside the mind’s resistance and limitations and allow the creative Self to emerge and guide them along the path of the screenplay.

			Though Portuguese, Spanish, and English were all spoken, the language barrier proved to be no barrier at all; each writer wrote in his or her native language, the pages were then translated into English, and everybody read the pages in their native language.

			My experience with the Latin American writers only reinforced what I’ve discovered in my travels and workshops; that no matter where you are in the world, no matter what language is spoken or what culture you’re in, the language and grammar of screenwriting are the same, whether in Paris or Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Tokyo, or Hollywood; writing is writing.

			The way the screenwriters approach their material may be different, as it is in Europe and America. But some of the problems are the same. The European and Latin American screenwriters basically approach their screenplays in the same way. The Europeans come from a historical, intellectual tradition, and they base their material on the strength of the original concept or idea; this tradition has been laid down and followed since the fifteenth century in all the great universities.

This approach is still prevalent today. The European screenwriters (and Latin American writers) approach the screenplay from the idea of the story; it is this idea that pushes the story forward, dramatizes it, becomes its visual metaphor. The filmmaker will take the idea and dramatize it. Just look at the trilogy Red, White, and Blue, from the great filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski. Each story embodies a certain idea, like justice, and this theme is seen visually throughout the film, in the characters’ emotions, as well as in the colors of the costumes and locations. The colors reflect the idea, the theme, and become an integral part of each story.

			Recently I had the opportunity of seeing Michelangelo Antonioni’s latest film, Beyond the Clouds. The opening image is of John Malkovich in an airplane high above the clouds, telling us he is a director, an observer of life; we then follow him through the four different episodes of the film and listen to his comments while observing the behavior of the characters.

			The idea behind the film is the “search for love,” and following this theme, we observe four different relationships. In the first segment, the girl is looking for a relationship through “words.” It is the words of love that are important to her. In the second episode the director becomes involved with an exotic woman who searches for the “passion of love.” In the third a marriage of many years is threatened by the husband’s attraction to a beautiful woman, and finally the wife leaves him to search for the love he cannot give her anymore. And in the last episode a young man pursues a young woman on her way to church, and waits for her during Mass, only to learn that she is “afraid of life,” and will enter a convent the next day.

			Everyone is searching for love. It is this idea that drives the film forward. Dramatizing the idea creates the structure.

			In a film like Wim Wenders’s Wings of Desire, for example, the screenwriter begins with the intellectual idea, and then clothes it in a dramatic way. The story is about an angel (Peter Handke) who longs to know what it’s like to be human. So Wenders shows us what it is to walk the path of a true human being. In the opening shots we see as well as hear the stream of consciousness of humanity as a parade of people passes in front of our eyes. Young and old, we witness their thoughts, their hopes and fears, their worries, their dreams. It’s a wonderful opening. Finally, the angel descends and becomes a human being, and we follow his journey through life and love, through the joys and sorrow of walking the path of life.

			But in the United States we approach the screenplay differently. Here, the screenwriter begins with an idea, then takes that idea and shapes it into a story, fashions it into a dramatic story line.

			What’s the difference?

			Take a look at How to Make an American Quilt. It is a story about the fragile nature of relationships, the fear of commitment, the patterns of mother and daughter. During the story we learn about the lives of the women who make up the quilting bee. But the story focuses on the relationship between Finn (Winona Ryder) and her fiancé, Sam. We witness her doubts and feelings, and through her we see the stories of the other women, woven together just like the “quilt of love” they are making for Finn’s wedding. It is a story, with beginning, middle, and end, and in the end her relationship is resolved. She follows the crow, who, just like the story in the quilt, leads her to Sam, and the last image we have is the two of them bedding down for the night in his VW bus. Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution; beginning, middle, and end.

			It is the story that drives this film, not the idea of commitment in relationships.

			A few years ago I saw a short film by a French filmmaker. It was about a man who walks into a McDonald’s restaurant on the Champs-Elysées and buys a huge order of french fries. He finds a strategic spot in the restaurant and suddenly begins throwing french fries all over; at the people, against the walls, on the floors, on the ceiling, everywhere. The people are furious. (It’s a serious comedy.) Many of the patrons challenge him but the man pays no attention and continues throwing the fries. The police arrive. They warn the man.

			But as soon as they leave, the man goes right back to throwing french fries. Soon, the entire restaurant is in an uproar. At the peak of their frenzy the man whips out a camera and starts taking pictures. Photograph after photograph is taken, and then in a blazing cut we see these same people as the subject of huge photographs now on display in a prestigious art gallery in Paris. It is only then that we understand that this man is a renowned artist, and the same people who were cursing him at McDonald’s are now spending huge bucks to buy these so-called works of art.

			Art is freedom of expression. That’s the idea behind the film; the idea is dramatized.

			The European screenwriter takes an idea and dramatizes it. The American screenwriter takes an idea and builds it into a story to dramatize it. If we took the idea that art is the freedom of expression, we would create a story. So we would search for a visual metaphor, a visual arena, to show our character, the artist, struggling for some kind of new art form, a new expression.

			Who is this artist? What is his life like? What are the relationships in his life? Where is he in his career? What is his relationship to art? What about his friends, his family? Is he successful or not?

			These questions all have to be answered to create a story. We take this information, the answers to these questions (writing is really the ability to ask the right questions) so we can structure this idea into a story line; we set up the artist’s life in Act I, show who he is and what he does. The Plot Point at the end of Act I will be the particular incident or event which finally shows him that, in order to survive, he must change his artistic expression and seek out a new form, maybe even a new medium. We set up a crisis period in his life.

			Act II would focus on his struggle to create a new form, and all the conflicts and hardships he has to endure in his professional, personal, and private lives. Gradually, we see him forging his first new form of expression, and then, at Plot Point II, he finds out what he has to do to generate a fusion of environmental and performance art.

			Act III would show him executing his new “art form” in the McDonald’s restaurant. Which is the entire French film.

			Art is the freedom of expression—as seen from the European point of view and an American perspective.

			The point to be made is that whether it’s a European or Latin American or American film, the problems of screenwriting are the same; it doesn’t matter in what language or culture the script is being written.

			A screenplay is a story told in pictures, and there will always be some kind of problem when you tell the story through words, and not pictures.

			It seems obvious, but I have had this experience over and over again: some of the writers I’ve worked with forget that a screenplay is a story told in pictures. They feel that if the characters can explain their particular thoughts, feelings, or emotions, the story line will somehow move forward through the characters’ dialogue, not the action. Through words, not pictures. They think because the character talks a lot there will be insight and dimension; but the truth is that we must see the character in a situation that reveals his/her personality, no matter what the conflict or obstacle, whether it is an internal, emotional one, or an external, physical one.

			Why is this significant?

			Because at this period in our history, we are in a major communications revolution, and the screenplay is a form that is constantly evolving, for film is a combination of both art and science. It is a craft that drifts upon the growth of scientific technology. There are times when the screenwriter writes something and science has to create a technology to make it happen. Like Terminator 2: Judgment Day; the special effects had not been created when the script was completed. They hoped the special effects would work, and they did, and because of the science, film took a giant leap forward to making the art of film “more real.”

			Without the computer graphics created for Terminator 2: Judgment Day, we would not have been so affected by the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park (David Koepp) or the oddity of Forrest Gump (Eric Roth). Or all those morphing commercials that are flooding the television screens.

			The computer technology of the nineties has literally exploded, creating a global revolution. The Internet, Web sites, all the on-line systems, connect the world. As of this writing over 50 million people in North America were on-line in 1997. The Wall Street Journal says that the number of people using the Internet is going to double and quadruple within a very short period of time.

			That’s only the beginning. Around the world people are using the Internet as part of their daily news-gathering ritual, and it is changing the ways we communicate with each other on a global scale. And this revolution is literally changing the way we see things. At this point in time we have become a visual society, and are no longer a literate one; the last fifty years have changed all that. No longer do we get our news and opinions from the written word. We get it from CNN, or the local news, and the Internet; we hear and see our music on CDs and video; and the latest study declares that the average person watches television on the average of three hours a day, more on the weekend; our children are computer literate by the age of six, and most of the time they are the ones who are teaching us to use the computer.

			This evolution of science and art is creating a new language of film, a more visual way of telling stories for the screen. The language of film is becoming more visual; scripts filled with pages and pages of great dialogue are now considered “too talky.” Two people talking in an office or restaurant, explaining things to each other, rarely works anymore.

			This seems to be one of the most common problems in screenwriting. Over and over again, in country after country, most of the stories unfold through dialogue, not action. The characters talk and talk, and this only leads to a story that is dull and boring, developing through events that need to be explained.

			Talking heads.

			That’s not screenwriting, that’s stage writing. An essential part of all screenwriting is finding places where silence works better than words, finding the right visual arena, or image, to tell the story.

			Today’s films are much more visual, the character’s emotional arc expressed through the character’s actions and reactions. “What is character but the determination of incident?” says Henry James. “And what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			How people react to the incidents and situations of the story tells us something about who they are: in other words, what they do is who they are.

			When I first saw Forrest Gump, I thought it was a very, very talky film. Most of the story is told through dialogue along with the voice-over narration. Act I reveals who Forrest is, and his voice-over tells us things we need to know, but the dialogue and images don’t contradict each other, they complement each other. Forrest tells us he has to wear leg braces because he has “a curved spine,” and wearing them will make him “straight as an arrow.” At first glance Forrest is dumb, maybe even stupid, as his IQ test states, but “stupid is as stupid does,” he says, quoting his mother. And on the surface most people think he’s some kind of retard, a “cripple,” on the ocean of life. So we see by his braces that he’s a “cripple,” physically challenged, and this image is shattered when he is chased by the bullies and forced to run for his life. Voice-over and dialogue complement each other, and this technique keeps the story from becoming talky, or dull and sentimental. Forrest is a man who follows his dreams, then makes them come true.

			Later, his behavior shows us something else: Forrest Gump is anything but a cripple. Though the words, pictures, and actions are different, they complement each other and move the story forward.

			The same with How to Make an American Quilt (Jane Anderson). Before the story can truly begin, we need to know who this character is. So Finn’s narration opens the film when she’s a little girl, and tells us about the relationship with her mother, grandmother, and quilting friends, and then, in a beautiful cut to present time, visually tells us what her problem is: her relationship to Sam and how anxious she is about getting married. She tells us that she has trouble completing things; she’s working on her third master’s thesis because every time she’s getting ready to complete it, she moves on to another subject and starts all over again. That, of course, is what her mother did with the men in her life. For Finn it is this fear of commitment that drives the story forward. In the end, however, she learns to follow her heart as the crow leads her to her understanding and final acceptance that Sam is truly her soul mate.

			Both these screenplays are studies in character, but in order to reveal who the characters are, and what the obstacles are that confront them, we must see who they are, through their actions and their words.

			Not through talking heads.

			So if you have a problem in that you think your story is being told in words, look for places to illustrate your character’s behavior. In Thelma & Louise (Callie Khouri) the title characters are packing for a two-day holiday to the mountains. Here’s the way Thelma packs: She grabs everything in sight, then throws and stuffs it into the suitcase. She pulls open her cosmetics drawer and empties the contents into the suitcase. Pulls open another drawer of clothes, dumps it into the already bulging suitcase. And that, we see, is the way she lives.

			Contrast this visually to the way Louise packs. They’re going away for two days, so she takes two pairs of pants, two blouses, two bras, one bathrobe, two sweaters, two pairs of socks, throws in another pair just for good measure, closes her suitcase, wipes clean the single glass in her spotless kitchen sink, and leaves.

			The difference between Thelma and Louise is the difference between night and day, an apple and an orange. Just from that simple action of packing a suitcase we learn a wealth of information about these two characters: one is messy, the other is neat, and it certainly reflects who they are in terms of their relationship with the men in their lives. Thelma married Darryl when she was seventeen, and the thought of growing old with him is not very appealing. “You get what you settle for,” Louise comments.

			Louise is not going to settle for the kind of relationship that Thelma settled for. As a matter of fact, this emotional decision of Louise’s is what kicks the whole story of Thelma & Louise into motion; in the back story Louise’s boyfriend, Jimmy, a musician, has been on the road for three weeks and has not called her once. And she’s pissed. So, “to get even,” she decides she’s not going to be home when he comes back in town. She’s not going to let him treat her that way, and this decision sets up the whole story. By making the arrangement to be with Thelma out of town when Jimmy arrives home, Louise barrels down the road of fate that leads to her killing Thelma’s rapist at Plot Point I.

			Within the context of this story and these characters, the simple illustration of packing a suitcase reveals more information than dialogue ever could.

			Instead of having your characters talk about their situation, let their behavior make the story line unfold in a more visual manner. Action is character; what a person does is who he is. Film is behavior.

			Now, it may be that your characterization requires your characters to talk a lot. That’s okay; just take a look at Pulp Fiction. The whole story is basically dialogue, and one long scene of dialogue leads to the next. The difference is in the quality of dialogue; Tarantino is a master at capturing the little quirks of character and behavior, like the discussion Jules and Vinnie have about McDonald’s.

			 				VINCENT

				In Amsterdam you can buy beer in a movie theater. And I don’t mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris you can buy beer at McDonald’s. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?



			 				JULES

				They don’t call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese?



			 				VINCENT

				No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn’t know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.



			 				JULES

				What’d they call it?



			 				VINCENT

				Royale with cheese.



			 				JULES

				(repeating)

				Royale with cheese. What’d they call a Big Mac?



			 				VINCENT

				Big Mac’s a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.



			 				JULES

				What do they call a Whopper?



			 				VINCENT

				I dunno, I didn’t go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?



			 				JULES

				What?



			 				VINCENT

				Mayonnaise.



			 				JULES

				Goddamn!



			 				VINCENT

				I seen ’em do it. And I don’t mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin’ drown ’em in it.



			 				JULES

				Uuccchh!



			On that note the scene ends and we cut to them opening the trunk of their car and pulling out an arsenal of weapons. We suddenly understand that these two guys are killers, and they’re on their way to a kill. The contrast between these two characters talking about the seemingly ordinary events of life, and their profession as hired killers, is what makes the scene work so effectively. That’s the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino.

			It’s easy to let your characters’ dialogue explain your characters and move the story forward. But a good screenplay is much more than talking heads. It is a story told with pictures, in dialogue, and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.

			Dazed, Lost, and Confused


			There may be times during the screenwriting process when you you experience a kind of a sinking sensation welling up inside and suddenly there is a cloud of negativity and confusion on the waters of your creativity. And it seems to come out of nowhere.

			Most writers, including myself, try to ignore the feeling, to push it away, hide it under the carpet, and the more we try to dispel it, to pretend it’s not there, to hover behind a false bravado, the more we realize we’re stuck, lost somewhere within the maze of our own creation.

			This is when we hit the “wall.” Almost all writers, at some time or other, experience this wall, or block, and try to force their way through it. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t.

			Most of the time it doesn’t. And no matter where you are in the screenwriting process, the first words-on-paper draft or the rewrite, it doesn’t take much to be overwhelmed by the writing process. We handle this kind of problem in many different ways, of course, like suddenly finding more important things to do; like cleaning the kitchen, or going to the market, or washing the dishes, or going to the movies. Whatever.

			After all, some parts of the story are more difficult than others. And some scenes need more work than others. But after a few days struggling with these particular pages, struggling with some of these thoughts and feelings, you may notice some doubts about your abilities as a writer begin to surface. You may find yourself thinking too much, asking yourself questions like: What am I going to do? How am I going to get back on track? I wonder if I’m in Writer’s Block? You’ll question yourself, your talent, your ability to get the job done.

			Then one morning you’ll wake up and suddenly recognize that a heaviness of haze and uncertainty hangs around your neck, and the feeling that’s been tugging at you for the last few days erupts and you know you really don’t know what you are doing. You finally admit that you don’t know how to help yourself or where to go and the only thing that makes any sense at all is surrendering to the state you are in—dazed, lost, and confused.

			Welcome to the world of screenwriting.

			It’s one of those common problems that strike fear in the hearts of screenwriters everywhere.

			In one of my recent screenwriting workshops, a student came into class one night with a strained and somewhat tortured look on her face. When I asked her what was wrong, her eyes welled up with tears and she became very serious, and said, “I don’t know where I’m going. I’m totally lost, I’m confused, and my pages are pure shit. All that’s happening is talk, talk, talk. I keep going around in circles and I don’t know what to do. I’m so upset, I could cry.”

			It’s a universal problem. How you get out of it varies from person to person, script to script, but the first thing to do is to admit you have a problem and it’s not going to go away until you deal with it, and confront it head-on. That’s just one of the truths of life.

			In my student’s case she was so close to the material, she couldn’t see it anymore, so the first thing I wanted her to do was just stop writing. When you reach this kind of crisis point, you’re so overwhelmed and frustrated that you have to regroup. Just stop writing. Put down your computer, pen, and paper, typewriter, tape recorder, however you’re working, and spend some time contemplating your story: What is your story about? What is the dramatic need of your main character? How are you going to resolve the story line? The answers to these questions are the key to getting back on track.

			My student’s story was about the reunion of four sisters after the death of their grandfather. In his will he had left them the house on the lake where they had all grown up. The main character had left this small southern town many years before to seek a professional career in New York. She had a lot of success in the city, but at the time the story begins, the company she has been working for all these years has just been purchased by a larger corporation and she’s been informed that a major restructuring of her department is planned, and could possibly affect her position. That’s the back story. When the story begins she is uncertain about the future, about her plans, about herself.

			When she arrives, it is time for an emotional self-inventory, a time to clean up her life and renew her relationships with her three sisters. She’s thrown into the cauldron of past and present, and must find her own way out. It is a dramatic and emotional situation loaded with dramatic possibilities.

			So I started asking some questions. The writer explained she was in the middle of the Second Act, so the first thing I asked her was if she was clear on her structural story points. She wasn’t, she confessed; she was unsure about the Mid-Point, and felt so confused, she wasn’t sure about Plot Point II either. She didn’t know what to do.

			So we went through the Problem-Solving process. Step by step. The first thing I had her to do was redefine the dramatic structure; so she went back to the story line and structured it on the Paradigm, identifying Plot Point I, Pinch I, the Mid-Point, Pinch II, and Plot Point II. She was still somewhat unsure about her ending, about whether the main character should stay and pick up the pieces of her life, or leave to go back to city and confront the uncertainty of change with a newfound awareness.

			Then I wanted to know if she felt this was a problem of Plot, Character, or Structure. “Character,” she replied, without hesitation. I didn’t necessarily agree with that; I thought it might be a problem of both Plot and Character.

			Look at it from both sides. From the Character side, the screenwriter had to deal with and know the inside, or emotional subtext, of the story; she had to trace the emotional arc that revolves around the relationships of the four sisters and whether they settle their differences or not. From the point of view of Plot, she had to be clear about the forces affecting the character from the outside: what happens to the house; if it’s sold what are they going to do, and if they keep it what are they going to do? Questions, questions, questions.

			We started from the character’s emotional state at the time the story begins. What is she feeling when she leaves her home in the city to return for her grandfather’s funeral? What’s going on in her life? In her professional life with her career, and in her personal life, with her relationships, and then in her private life—what she does for herself, and how she feels about herself.

			So we explored this a little. In the back story her company has just been taken over by a conglomerate, so how does she feel about it? How old is she when the story begins? Is there some kind of biological clock ticking, or already ringing? Is her grandfather’s funeral going to get in the way of an important business decision? I wanted the writer to define the forces working on the character from the very beginning. What’s going on with her relationships? Is she in a relationship? Is it a good relationship, is it beginning to unravel, or is she alone? Define it, from the beginning, when they first met. What would she do if she left her position and looked for another job?

			These emotional questions needed to be answered and clearly defined before my student could go back into the story and confidently dig more deeply into the character.

			Then I had her define her relationship with her sisters. I asked if she had gone back into the character’s childhood and examined their feelings for one another, suggesting that she could even create some new incidents or events that might have happened. When she finished with that, I had her do an exercise in which she created a key experience in the life of the main character (her name was Abby), which might have happened between the ages of ten and sixteen, something that can reflect and become an emotional undercurrent of the story in present time. It may have been something that happened between her and her grandfather, or a traumatic incident with one of her sisters, something Abby still remembers and thinks about.

			In Thelma & Louise it’s the fact that Louise refuses to take one step in the state of Texas, even though it’s going to cost her life; later we learn she was raped when she was a young girl living there. That’s why she shoots Harlan in the parking lot when he’s attempting to rape Thelma.

			“What is character but the determination of incident?” Henry James asks.

			I call this particular essay the Circle of Being (see Chapter 13). It is a specific incident that happens to the main character when he or she is between the ages of ten and sixteen. What it creates is an undercurrent that reflects a particular situation in the story in present time. In Abby’s case it was her mother’s early death and Abby’s promise to look after her sisters. And though Abby made the promise, she resented it greatly because it was her dream to move away from the small town she’d grown up in.

			I told the writer that she had to dive back into her characters’ lives and redefine Abby’s feelings when she returns and deals with the death of her grandfather, whom she had loved dearly; and how does she feel now that she is returning home? My student had not even considered these questions, or the emotional forces working on her characters. If you’re writing this story, I told her, you have to know your characters’ thoughts, feelings, and emotions; especially during the early years growing up at the lake, as young adults, and, most important, how they feel about each other now, in present time.

			Another issue the Circle-of-Being exercise created was the influence of what the house means to each of the sisters. In terms of memories, cash value, and sentimental attachment, whatever. That house means something to each of the sisters; what is it? If you don’t know, just read or reread Chekhov’s The Three Sisters.

			These emotional forces are working on the four characters through the entire screenplay; they are like the threads of color woven through the tapestry of your story line.

			In How to Make an American Quilt the physical and emotional pasts of the characters are interwoven through the entire story line. The emotional life of the characters, their memories and Circle-of-Being experience, is structured in such a way that we can see the arc of the Winona Ryder character, see her understanding, awareness, and the change in her relationship to Sam.

			If you are writing a story like this and do not know those emotional forces working on your character, it is very easy to run up against “the wall” and keep “going around in circles,” ultimately falling into the well of Writer’s Block.

			Here’s the way it usually works. You’re totally immersed in the day-to-day process of screenwriting, but there may be one scene or sequence that does not work as well as it should and you might begin to wonder why it’s not working. It’s just a random thought and you probably pay no attention to it. But if the scene still does not work, you might become aware of a subtle shift occurring within yourself, maybe some doubts about why this scene or sequence is failing to come together. Then you might find that you’re talking to yourself, having a little conversation about The Problem. The first thing that usually happens is you start questioning yourself: “If I weren’t so stupid, I could do this,” you might think to yourself. And the more you wrestle with the problem, the more your image as a screenwriter begins to erode, and then you might start making disparaging comments about yourself and your ability. That’s when you begin sliding into “the pit,” and soon an entire litany of negative judgments descends upon you.

			“I knew I should have stayed away from this subject,” you might think to yourself; or “I can’t write worth shit.” Soon you’ll begin to expand and enlarge upon your own insecurities, thinking, “I don’t know whether I should be writing this script,” or “maybe I just don’t have the talent to do this.” or, “maybe I should just find a partner and write it with someone else.” It goes on and on.

			But underneath all these thoughts, comments, or judgments you’re making is the common thread that somehow this is all “your fault.” If you could do it, you would, and if you can’t, it’s because you don’t have the talent or ability to do it. In short, we turn it inside and blame ourselves.

			No wonder it’s called “Writer’s Block.”

			If you’re in this particular dilemma, and your creative voice is smothered by this blanket of doubt and negativity, then it’s time to give the critic a voice. That means giving that judgmental, critical, and negative voice that’s roaming around inside your head the opportunity to speak his or her mind.

			First, go to your screenplay pages—it doesn’t matter whether you’re writing on computer, typewriter, pad, or paper. Then take out a separate piece of paper and label it The Critic’s Page. As you start writing, every time you become aware of a negative comment or judgment coming up, write it down on The Critic’s Page. Number the comments, label them, just as if you were making a shopping list. For example, you might become aware that “these pages are terrible,” or “I don’t really know what I’m doing,” or “This isn’t working,” or “Maybe somebody else should finish it for me.” Maybe “These characters all sound the same,” and it’s apparent that “I’ve lost my vision,” and so on. Whatever your thoughts and comments are about your pages, just lay them down; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5….

			The first day you’re doing The Critic’s Page, you may write two pages of screenplay, and four pages of the critic. On the second day maybe you’ll write three pages of screenplay and two or more pages of the critic. The third day maybe four or five pages of screenplay and a page or two of the critic.

			At that point, stop writing. Take The Critic’s pages, put them in order, and just read them; day one, day two, day three. As you think about these comments, mull them over in your mind. You’ll discover something very interesting; the critic always says the same thing. It doesn’t matter what kind of a scene it is, or who the characters are, or what you write, whether it’s the pages from day one, two, or three, or whether it’s a dialogue scene or an action scene, the critic says the same thing—the same words, the same phrases, the same expressions. It’s all the same. No matter what you write, this is what your critic is going to be telling you. It stinks, it’s no good, you should be doing something else.

			That’s the nature of the mind, to judge, to criticize, to evaluate. The mind can either be our best friend or our worst enemy. It’s so easy to get plugged into judgments of right or wrong, good or bad.

			Now, it could be that what the critic says is accurate. Maybe the pages are terrible, the characters are thin and one-dimensional, and you’re going around in circles. So what? Confusion is the first step toward clarity. What you try that doesn’t work always shows you what does work. As you struggle through any problem area, just get something down on paper. Just write shitty pages. You’ll always be able to go back and make them better. That’s the process all writers go through. So what if you’ve “hit a wall” and are going around in circles, dazed, lost, and confused?

			Give the critic a voice. If you don’t give the critic a voice, it will turn inside and begin to fester, getting worse and worse until it bursts. It’s easy to let yourself become your own victim.

			Until you become aware of the critic’s voice running around at the back of your mind, you’re going to become a victim of that voice. Recognizing and acknowledging that voice is the first step through the block; it’s not necessary to act upon, or make a decision about, the judgments and evaluations the critic makes—whether the critic is right or not. No matter what stage you are at in the writing process, whether it’s first words on paper, or rewriting, don’t get too serious about what the critic tells you. One of the things we have to accept is that we always get lost within the maze of our own creations.

			Many times the writer wants to use too many characters. In my student’s story there were four sisters, but she hadn’t done enough “creative research,” she hadn’t dug deeply enough into her characters, and she became lost in her story line. She did not know where she was going, had no idea of the emotional arc of each character, so she switched the point of view to different characters, and with four characters it becomes difficult to maintain an emotional progression through the story line. It’s easy to lose sight of the main character if you do this, and that’s why my student felt she was writing “in circles.” She was. She had lost focus on the dramatic need of her main character, and thus lost sight of her story.

			And when she reached that point in her script, it was all over. She had fallen off the map of her story line and the incidents that keep a story moving forward were leading nowhere. They were all dead ends. She didn’t know what to do or where to go; her friends were no help, as they didn’t understand the emotional circumstances of her writing experience.

			As you sink deeper and deeper, the Writer’s Block becomes bigger and bigger, hammering you into submission; the mere thought of writing turns you off; and because you’re not writing you’ll feel guilty, so whenever you sit down to work, you suddenly feel this “blanket of heaviness” settle over your head. You’ll lose all objectivity, and fall into despair and ponder the meaning of life with thoughts of death and suicide.

			Writer’s Block. It happens all the time. To everybody. The difference is how you deal with it. How you see it.

			There are two different ways to look at this “problem.” One is to see your dilemma as a real problem, a real block, something to “overcome,” or “break through,” a physical and emotional obstacle that locks you into a creative straitjacket.

			That’s one way of looking at it.

			But there’s another way of looking at it. And that is to see the ordeal as part of the writer’s experience; everybody goes through it. It’s nothing new or unusual. If you recognize and acknowledge that, you’ve reached a creative crossroads. The realization becomes a creative guide to another level of your screenwriting craft. If you can look at it as an opportunity, you will find a way to strengthen and broaden your ability to create characters and story. It shows you that maybe you need to go deeper into your story, and strive for another level of richness, full of texture and dimension.

			“A man’s reach should exceed his grasp,” the poet Robert Browning wrote.

			If you understand that being dazed, lost, and confused is only a symptom, this “problem” becomes an opportunity to test yourself. Isn’t that what life’s all about—putting yourself on the line in a situation where you test yourself to rise to another level? It’s simply an evolutionary step along the path of the screenwriting process.

			If you accept this point of view, it means you’re going to have to dig deeper into your material; you’re going to have to stop writing, go back into your character’s life and action, and define and clarify different elements of your character’s life. You’re going to have to go back and do new character biographies; define or redefine the characters and their relationships to each other that are the hub of your story line. In the chapters ahead there will be different exercises offered to deal with problems like this.

			If you’re working on a particular scene, for example, you may need to rewrite the scene, or change the points of view of your characters; you may need to change locations, or create new actions, new episodes or events, for your character. Sometimes you may have to restructure the action for a particular scene or sequence by restructuring an entire act!

			If you’re adapting a book, or an article, into a screenplay, at least there’s a story line to follow, a thread of narrative that weaves itself through the incidents and events of the dramatic action. Sometimes there’s a tendency to let the dialogue of the book, or play, whatever the original material is, dictate the story; if you rely on this too much it becomes an obstacle that will impede the screenplay. You may be trying to be too true to the source material.

			That doesn’t work at all. You’ve got to make the material your own, and that means breaking down the book, creating incidents or characters that complement the film’s story line; so whatever you do, leave the book behind, and create whatever you need to make it work.

			Whenever you feel lost, dazed, or confused, it only becomes a problem if you let it become a problem.

			The things you try that don’t work always show you what does work.

			The Nature of Dull


			Have you ever read something you’ve written and realized it’s the dullest and most boring writing you’ve ever read? The pages seem worthless, trite, and your worst fears are confirmed: you have no talent, no ability, and the whole experience is like a bad dream. I mean, who cares, anyway!

			It’s not an uncommon feeling, and while it may be true some of the time, it’s not true all the time. When you take a look at what you’ve written, and make the judgment that it’s dull and boring, what can you do to fix it?

			In other words, what is the nature of dull?

			To really understand it, we have to explore the symptoms of dull—those traits in your writing style that may lead to writing dull and boring pages. And since this is a book about recognizing and identifying the symptoms of various screenwriting problems, we’re going to take a look at what makes up the essence of dull writing.

			That means examining the relationship between bad writing and good writing, since you can’t define anything until you measure and compare it to something else; nothing exists in relationship to itself. And since relationship means a connection between two or more things, it means we can’t define dull and boring writing until we know what makes up good writing.

			When you read a well-written screenplay, “a good read,” the words literally leap off the page at you. Part of it is style, yes, part of it is structure, yes, but the real dynamic of good screenwriting is creating strong and active characters, combined with a unique, stylized visual narrative that constantly moves the story forward. Many films reflect this very well: The Shawshank Redemption, How to Make an American Quilt, Sense and Sensibility (Emma Thompson), blend story with character, and a situation many people can relate to. Twelve Monkeys (David and Janet Peoples) blends a strong visual style with an interesting dramatic premise, but it’s a “one-line” script (it lacks depth and dimension) that moves the story forward to its contrived and somewhat predictable ending. Blade Runner (Hampton Fancher and David Peoples) treats this same kind of theme more imaginatively, as does The Fugitive (Andrew Davis).

			Strong action and strong characters. That’s what makes good screenwriting.

			One of the interesting things about a dull or boring screenplay is that nobody will tell you that it’s dull and boring. People will say they didn’t like it, or it didn’t work for them, or they didn’t like the characters or the premise, or maybe it’s too serious, or too funny. But no one, not even wife, husband, lover, or best friend, will tell you that what you’ve written is a dull and boring screenplay. Go through your own experience and check it out.

			In the long run, whether you’ve fallen into the pit of “dull and boring” is something you’re going to have to determine for yourself. You might have to admit the possibility that you’ve written something that needs to be more active, more dynamic, something that will keep the reader turning pages. Because that’s what good writing is all about—keeping the reader turning pages.

			So, what are some of those qualities that make up good screenwriting?

			Several things: perhaps the most important is to understand that the foundation of all good dramatic writing is conflict. All drama is conflict; without conflict you have no character; without character you have no action; without action you have no story. And without story you have no screenplay.

			Dramatic conflict can either be internal or external; an emotional story like How to Make an American Quilt, or Sense and Sensibility has internal (and external) conflict. External conflict is a story where the conflict is outside the character, and the characters face physical (and of course, emotional) obstacles, such as Apollo 13 or Jurassic Park (Michael Crichton and David Koepp). Creating conflict within the story, through the characters and events, is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing, whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.

			In my seminars and workshops, no matter what the language or culture, I find that many screenwriters do not understand the importance of conflict in their stories. And their screenplays reflect that. So many times the characters seem listless, the scenes slow, taking too much time to develop; there is little or no direction, and it boils down to a screenplay that is dull and boring to read.

			So what is conflict? If you look at the word it means to be “in opposition”; and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character or characters be in opposition to someone, or something. Conflict can be anything, a struggle or a quarrel, a battle or a chase scene, internal or external, any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental.

			Conflict must be at the very hub of your story, because it is the core of strong action and strong character. If you do not have this conflict, this foundation to your writing, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in the quagmire of dull writing.

			If you wanted to examine “the stuff” that makes dull writing, what would you say? What is the nature of dull? What does it look like? What does it taste like, and what is its essence, the seed that sprouts into the tree?

			There are symptoms that can be identified if you know what to look for, and they usually give a pretty good indication of what the problem is, whether the script is slow and heavy, or too long, or all the characters sound the same. If that’s the case, then how do you fix it, or shape it, transform it from a “bad read” into a “good read”?

			For example, if your dramatic premise seems weak and not clearly articulated and defined within the first ten pages, then the chances are that the Set-Up is weak and the material is going to wander around in different directions and lack a dramatic focus. That’s a symptom; let it go on too long and you’ve got a dull screenplay; just as a scratchy irritation in the throat is sometimes the symptom of a cold or flu. Symptoms reveal things, and in the “art” of medicine, if you read the symptoms correctly, then you can find the cause, and heal the disease, whatever it might be. At least, in theory.

			In screenwriting you cure the problem by knowing and understanding its symptoms. For example, suppose a writer wants to create a strong action line and, in so doing, sets up the story so fast, he or she simply skims over, or omits, necessary and essential character information? It won’t take the writer long to realize the character’s been sacrificed for action.

			We can identify this because the character will be so busy reacting to the events or the situation that we don’t have an opportunity to learn anything about him or her. That’s a symptom. And it always seems to lead to a dull and boring read. When I see a script unfolding like this, with the character simply reacting to his or her situation, I’ll give the writer thirty pages to see whether it works or not. If it doesn’t, I’ll stop reading, because I don’t need to read any more to see the story’s not working.

			Screenwriting is a craft; one scene builds upon another, and the visual information we receive is cumulative; it is that relationship between the scene and the dramatic need of the story that keeps it moving forward. As mentioned before, each scene must fulfill one of two major functions in the storytelling process: A scene either moves the story forward, or reveals information about the main character(s). And if that doesn’t happen, and you wander off in some side directions that are unrelated to the main narrative line, then the gravity of dull will gradually drag your story to a standstill.

			Sometimes the symptom of a dull read begins with a situation that is not believable; the characters or the situation seems too farfetched, or too predictable; events happen too easily, and we know that people would not act or react to the situation the way they do in the screenplay. Just look at the ending of Waterworld. To have a character discard what has driven him through the whole movie, and then go back to the way he was before the story began, is totally unbelievable. It’s a pose, an image. Within the context of the story it doesn’t work. No matter how far out the story is.

			In the lexicon of literary criticism this concept is known as the “willing suspension of disbelief.” The English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge stated that when you approach a work of art, you must leave your perception of reality behind and approach it on its own merits, on its own level. In other words, you must willingly suspend your disbelief no matter how far the subject matter strays from what you know to be true, or not true. No matter how outrageous the premise, no matter how unpredictable the characters, the situations, reactions, or plot developments are, all thoughts have to be left behind when you approach “the work.”

			Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a perfect example. The dramatic premise of a world self-destructing in August 1997, creating an age of machines, who have sent back through time a “terminator” to destroy, when he is ten years old, the person who will lead the future rebellion is pretty far out. Is it believable? Logically, of course not, but we believe the film experience because of the strong action, strong character, and incredible special effects. The same with Blade Runner.

			If the action and characters do not make a story line believable, then there is no “willing suspension of disbelief.” We believe the Ace Ventura movies or Dumb and Dumber because they’re so ridiculous they couldn’t be real, so there’s nothing we can’t believe within the dramatic context.

			Contrast this with what we see on episodic television or on some of the MOWs that grace our television airwaves; usually, it’s unreal people in unreal situations.

			That’s because writing for television and writing for film are two different things; one’s an apple and one’s an orange. One is a radio soap opera with pictures, where everything has to be explained, and the other is a story told through pictures, finding places where silence works better than words. In episodic TV, for example, you’re writing characters that have already been created, so writing for series television means the writer has to focus on how these people react in certain situations.

			In many of the MOWs, the basis of the story, whether it’s taken from a real-life experience or not, is diluted and watered down into a predictable and convenient story line; the focus is on the commercials, not the show. “Television is an advertising medium where the shows fill up the time between commercials” is the way one television executive described it. Dramatic choices are made because there’s not enough time to dig deeper to get underneath the character’s skin—to find a bridge to the character’s inner country. So, if the reader does not believe the dramatic premise and situation, then you’ve had it; there is no “willing suspension of disbelief.”

			It is a major symptom in the nature of dull.

			I remember talking with Oliver Stone, and he told me that Platoon had languished on the shelf for more than ten years, and he had really given up hope of seeing it made during his lifetime. When I asked why, he told me that most of the people who read the first draft of the screenplay were captivated by it, while others were afraid that the war in Vietnam was not a commercial subject. And this was after he had won the Academy Award for Midnight Express. But there were a few friends who told him that when they read the material they didn’t “get” it, that it really didn’t hold their interest.

			That’s the kiss of death. So he went back to reread the script and suddenly realized he had introduced some twenty-six characters in the first ten pages of the screenplay. That’s just too many characters for the reader to follow. No wonder it didn’t hold their interest. When Stone understood the problem, he went back and rewrote the opening by cutting out several characters and focusing more on the main character (Charlie Sheen); we see the war through his eyes, share his experience, even though he is surrounded by all those other characters.

			In Nixon, which Stone directed and cowrote along with Stephen Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson, his directorial use of cross-cutting between the many different characters is very much like “surfing” the tube, or “surfing” the Net, and the way he goes from one character and situation to another, from one scene to another, is brilliant. We live in the world of multimedia now, and our attention spans are brief, so we can see and understand things as we do on television, with our remotes clicking from one channel to another, or clicking from one Web site to another. That’s the style of Nixon, the way it’s written and structured.

			Besides the lack of conflict and material being unbelievable, what are some of the other symptoms of dull screenwriting?

			Sometimes incidents and events are too contrived and too predictable. Things happen too easily. This is usually because the dramatic need of the main character is not defined or sufficiently well thought out; the obstacles become too predictable, the conflict too shallow. The dramatic needs of the story are being satisfied too easily, and that tends to dilute the narrative drive. What do you get? Dull and boring.

			Other screenplays rely on subplots to move the story forward. This dilutes the focus of the main character and gives rise to a thin and one-dimensional characterization. Most of the action is spent cross-cutting between the scenes of character that are needed to move the story forward, and scenes of the subplot. The story jumps back and forth between one thread of the subplot and the main story line, and if you set up your First Act this way, then the two stories come together at Plot Point I. Other times the stories will merge together late in the Second Act, and that makes it more confusing because you don’t really know what the story is about, or who it’s about.

			Cross-cutting between the story line and the subplot makes the reader work too hard trying to figure out what the relationship is between the two or more threads of the story. Sometimes a subplot is necessary, but if the essential story points have not been set up and introduced properly, the story become so complicated that it’s difficult to understand what’s going on.

			An easy way to spot one of the symptoms of dull is through the main character. As mentioned, good screenwriting always shows itself in strong character and strong action. So, if you use your main character as an indicator, and feel that he or she is not strong enough, or there’s too much dialogue and not enough visual action, you’re probably right in assuming the character is weak and reactive. In this case the character appears to ride the surface of the story line, and there’s not enough information to go deeper into the psyche of the character to see what’s really going on.

			Think about creating an incident that works upon your character in such a way that his or her reaction reveals a more forceful and illuminating dimension of character.

			This creation of incident will be reflected in the scenes you choose to write, for the screenplay is revealed through the scene; it is the cell of dramatic action. A scene is composed of shots, what the camera sees, and it can either be a single shot, or a series of shots, held together by a specific location; where the scene takes place, and the time when it takes place. If you change either place or time, then you have to change the scene. Moving from the kitchen to the living room to the garage means three different scenes, because there are three separate locations. If you had a scene in the kitchen in the morning, then have one in the afternoon, it’s two different scenes. Why? Because you have to change the light; morning light is totally different from afternoon light, so if you change the time, that means making a lighting change and you must therefore write a new scene.

			Basically, there are two ways to create a scene: one is to write the scene in the direct or obvious way, in which the characters do what is expected and natural. Since the primary ingredient of drama is the unexpected, you try to play against the grain of the scene, that is, take the unexpected approach.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, when Tommy, the young man, tells Andy and Red a former cell mate had revealed to him that he had murdered a banker’s wife and her lover, “and the banker got blamed for it,” we know for the first time that Andrew (Tim Robbins) is innocent. When Andy goes to the warden and tries to convince him of his innocence, the warden refuses to listen, and throws him in the hole for a month.

			The next scene shows Tommy being called outside to have a “heart-to-heart” talk with the warden. The warden wants to know “the right thing to do” and wants Tommy’s help to verify if what he told Andy is true. Would Tommy be willing to “swear before a judge and jury…having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself?” “Just gimme that chance,” Tommy replies. The warden nods, understanding, puts out his cigarette, looks up at the guard tower, then turns away, and in that instant Tommy is gunned down.

			The obvious way to do that scene would be to have the warden tell Tommy that he’s never going to get a chance to testify, that he knows he’s lying, and nothing Tommy would say or do could convince the warden to open up Andy’s case for a retrial. Normally, we’d expect the warden would help Andy reclaim his innocence, and count on Tommy to help him do it.

			And that’s the way Frank Darabont, the screenwriter, sets us up; then he turns everything around when he has the kid gunned down by the prison guard. Now we know who the real criminal is. Then, to rub it in, the warden goes to Andy in the hole, and tells him the boy was shot trying to escape. And just to let Andy know who’s really in charge here, he keeps him in the hole for another month. That action sets up Andy to escape at Plot Point II. We expect one thing, then something else happens. It’s the indirect approach to the scene that makes it work so effectively.

			Another symptom of dull screenwriting is when the screenwriter enters the scene too early and too much time is spent talking about something totally unrelated that will move the story forward. For example, entering a scene too early usually results in the characters talking about something totally unrelated to the purpose of the scene. Enter the scene just before the purpose is revealed; Enter late and get out early is the general rule.

			The art of screenwriting is in finding places where silence works better than words. Recently, one of my students told me that after he had completed writing a scene, the thought occurred to him to go back and take another look at it. Something was bothering him about it and he didn’t know what it was. So he read and reread the scene, and suddenly understood how he could make it work more effectively with just two lines of dialogue! That’s just good screenwriting. You don’t need pages and pages of dialogue to set up, explain, or move your story forward; just a few lines will do, if you enter the scene at the right point.

			In How to Make an American Quilt past and present are woven together by questions and answers. And even though there are many different stories, they are all connected with the theme of the film: “Where Love Resides.” Each story deals with an affair of the heart, and each reflects another aspect of Finn’s dilemma regarding her commitment to Sam. The quilt is the metaphor for the entire film.

			Another symptom: having the character always react to situations or events. If that happens too much, the character becomes passive and reactive. An important ingredient of good character creation is finding the best way to introduce that character. If your character is too egotistical or uncaring, he or she will be unsympathetic. Just look at Diehard 3; we meet the Bruce Willis character drunk, in a van, not having seen his wife in a year. We don’t really care too much about him.

			Sometimes a screenplay starts off too quickly, and if the action happens too fast, the reader doesn’t know who or why the character is participating in this action or event. If the story starts off too slowly, then everything has to be explained through dialogue, so there is no dramatic tension to pull the reader through the story line. It leads to a dull screenplay.

			One of the things I’ve discovered about the nature of dull is that while scenes may be structured well, with the dialogue clean and sharp, there is no payoff to the scene. We don’t see the natural conclusion of the scene because the screenwriter cuts away before the purpose of the scene is fulfilled. I’ve read so many screenplays where the writer seems to forget why the scene is in there in the first place. Each scene is related to every other, and you’ve only got 120 pages to tell your story, so you can’t waste time writing scenes that are not paid off. Characters, incidents, events, decisions, all need to be set up at some point in the story. It doesn’t have to be in the scene before, or in the same scene, or in the scene after, it can be anywhere, because all aspects of a story line are related to one another and therefore information can be planted anywhere. It can be set up in the first ten pages, then paid off in Act II or III. What really matters is when you set something up in the screenplay, you have to pay it off, either visually or verbally; either through pictures or dialogue.

			Another aspect to the nature of dull is overwritten scene description. People across the world ask me how long a descriptive paragraph should be, and I reply that any descriptive paragraph, whether it’s action or character, or any combination of the two, should not be longer than four sentences.

			Why four? There are many reasons. First, when you’re writing a screenplay there has to be a lot of white space on the page. Long, bulky, single-spaced paragraphs that take up a half page or more are just too difficult to read. I tell my students that I don’t care what the particular action is, they just can’t put it all into one descriptive paragraph. Break the paragraph up into four or five sentences. A reader reads the screenplay as if he or she is seeing the movie on the screen. So pages have to be lean, clean, and tight, and not bogged down with a lot of descriptive comments that will never make their way to the screen.

			The quickest way to make a reader put down a screenplay is to stop him with a lot of thick and bulky paragraphs that fill up the page. It turns the reader off, and becomes another symptom in the nature of dull.

			PROBLEMS OF PLOT





The Problem Sheet


			The Problem Sheet is an abbreviated guide that is meant to be used as an interactive tool. It lists a number of screenwriting symptoms that can help you identify and define various problems. If you have a problem, and you match it with some of the symptoms listed, the contents in that chapter can offer various ways of solving it. Some symptoms listed will be the same for several chapters. That’s because the same symptoms are relevant for different kinds of problems; it really doesn’t matter whether it’s a problem of Plot, Character, or Structure. A problem is a problem, no matter how you label it.

			Too Much, Too Soon


			What happens when you read a screenplay and you have the impression that something’s wrong with it, but you don’t really know what it is? If you think about it, you might be able to trace your awareness, or discomfort, from the very beginning of the script. And if you examine that feeling a little further, then go back and take another look at the material, you’ll probably see that the problem has been present right from the beginning.

			As a general rule, if you want to find the origin of any problem you have to start looking for it at the very start—from page one, word one. If you do that and analyze the material, you may begin to notice some things. For example, there may be too many characters, or you don’t really know who the main character is, who the story is about. Or maybe it just feels like the script is too talky and the action progresses more through dialogue and exposition than the visual image. Or so much seems to be happening that the focus of the story, what it’s really about, seems choppy, sloppy, and disjointed.

			Look at the material again, and you will probably realize that there is so much information being given and the story moves so fast, you might not really know what’s going on.

			All these elements are symptoms of too much information being given too early in the story; too much is happening too soon. The result: not enough depth or insight into the characters and not enough conflict or drama in the narrative line. And it’s definitely a problem.

			If you want to look for the cause or the source of this particular problem, it will almost always be found in Act I and, more specifically, in the first ten pages of the screenplay.

			A good screenplay is set up from page one, word one. Act I is a unit of dramatic action that begins with the opening scene and continues until the Plot Point at the end of the act. It is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up; because all the elements of the story, the characters, the dramatic premise and situation, the relationships between them, must be established within this particular unit of dramatic action. Act I is a unit of action in which all the elements of the story must be carefully integrated and set up; all the incidents and events in this unit of action must lead directly to the Plot Point at the end of Act I, the true beginning of your story.

			If the script is not set up correctly, then there is a certain tendency to keep adding characters and events to the story line to make it move faster. The story seems to skate on the surface of the action without penetrating its layers of texture and depth, creating the feeling that the story is trite, contrived, and predictable.

			Why does this happen? It seems like many writers approach their screenplays without enough preparation; they’re so anxious to begin writing the script that they don’t take the time to explore and develop the relationships between the action and characters. So they begin from the smallest kernel of information and then feel their way through the First Act. Most of their time is spent trying to figure out what the story is about and what happens next, so they throw down as many story points as they can in the First Act, hoping the story will manifest itself.

			It doesn’t work. Seeds are planted, but not cultivated, watered, or nourished. The writer tells his or her story in the first ten pages, then is lost and doesn’t know what to do next.

			Preparation and research are essential to the screenwriting process. It is the responsibility of the screenwriter to know and clearly define who the main character is, what the dramatic premise is—what the story is about—and what the dramatic situation is—the circumstances surrounding the action. If you don’t know the story well enough, if you haven’t spent enough time doing the required research, then you run the risk of inserting more incidents and events into the story line just to try to make it work, and then the narrative thread of the story usually goes awry; the stuff just isn’t working.

			Sometimes the problem exists because the story line is too thin, and more “plot” has to be found, but the solution is not creating more interesting incidents or characters to put into the screenplay. Creating more “things” to happen, more obstacles to confront, doesn’t do anything except expand the problem.

			The trouble is often traceable to a writer’s impulse to get the script off to a fast and provocative start. If you’ve only got ten pages to grab the attention of the reader or audience, then the tendency is to make sure the story captures the reader’s interest. And often that means dumping the characters, their obstacles, and their relationship with the other characters into this ten-page unit of dramatic action.

			It’s too much, too soon. More is not necessarily better. If you take great screenplays like Shawshank Redemption, Thelma & Louise, The Silence of the Lambs, or Apollo 13, all the major ingredients of the story line are either there in place, or referred to, within the first ten-page unit of dramatic action. That’s why the context of Act I is the Set-Up.

			The Shawshank Redemption is a great example. Since the story deals with Andy in prison, we have to set up the murder of Andy’s wife and lover, as well as the trial and verdict, before he enters the prison. We have to know why he’s there and what crime he has committed. The three threads of the story line—murder, trial, and verdict—are brilliantly intercut, so we see the events leading to his conviction even though we don’t actually see him committing the murders.

			Many screenwriters would approach the story from the perspective of dialogue; they might begin with Andy entering the prison, and then, during his relationship with Red, he would tell the story in bits and pieces. As Red informs us in voice-over, Andy didn’t seem to belong in the prison population; when he walked “he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or worry.” During their first few scenes together he could explain to Red about the murder of his wife. In terms of setting up the story this approach would work, but then the tendency might be to explain rather than reveal.

			In Apollo 13 the first ten pages set up all the narrative threads that are needed to establish the situation. After newsreel shots of the fire that killed the three astronauts of Apollo 1 (the transition from newsreel to present time, TV to TV, is very much like the flashback transitions in How to Make an American Quilt, except the quilt is used as the visual motif), the script opens with a friendly partylike gathering watching Neil Armstrong’s first walk on the moon. In just a few words we learn these people are astronauts in the current NASA program and the dream of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is to land on the moon. In just a few pages we know everything we need to know, including the suspicion that his wife has some deep fear about his going into space again.

			The dramatic hook occurs on page 10, when Lovell returns home and surprises his family with the news that his space mission has just been moved up to the Apollo 13 position. (Originally, a scene had been written showing Lovell with the NASA officials getting the assignment, but it slowed everything down, so it was cut.)

			Once he gets the assignment, we can focus, in the second ten pages, on his training and preparation for the mission, so we can see what the astronauts had to go through to prepare for their flight. Plot Point I is the lift-off into space.

			Apollo 13 is an excellent example of classic screenwriting that sets up character and story from page one, word one, both through action and dialogue. The script could easily have started with Lovell and his crew being informed their mission was being pushed up, and if it had been written that way, most of the expository information would have to be established in this first ten-page unit of dramatic action.

			In Sense and Sensibility, based on Jane Austen’s nineteenth-century novel, it would have been very easy to put in too much too soon. In the first few pages we could set up the back story, the relationships within the family, the death of the father, how it affects the three sisters, but this normally would be too much information for Act I. Nevertheless, it’s got to be there for us to set up the story correctly.

			How did Emma Thompson handle this? In voice-over we hear about the family, see the father on his deathbed, and we learn the fortunes of the family are to be automatically inherited by the son. And he promises his dying father that he will take care of his three sisters. But after the funeral the son’s wife has other plans for her husband’s inheritance.

			That’s a lot of information to present in the first ten pages. But it’s been set up in both narration and pictures, so we see the father’s widow and his three daughters are literally without the roof over their heads. The rest of Act I deals with how the family is going to cope with this new situation, and we see them play it out in scene after scene. The girls have to be married, of course, for in those days women needed husbands to take care of them. And when the possible match between the Emma Thompson character with Hugh Grant doesn’t happen, the girls give up the house to their brother and move to the country. Plot Point I.

			If all this back-story information had been executed through dialogue, there would have been way too much explanation in the story. It would have been too wordy, the characters passive and reactive, the scenes too long and expository, with the result that the narrative action would not move the story forward.

			Take a look at the Problem Sheet. It’s all there.

			That’s why each element of the story line must be carefully laid out before you even begin writing. Believe it or not, most problems in screenwriting are there because not enough research was done; the story, the characters, and all the dramatic forces working on the story have not been thought out enough.

			The inclination to put too much, too soon, into your story line is, I find, usually the result of a number of different things, but the primary cause is that most writers don’t spend enough time doing character research. A biography of the main character may not have been written, or maybe not enough was written, with the result that the character seems thin or unsympathetic. The result: a weak character so busy reacting to all the incidents and events of the plot that he or she becomes passive and seemingly disappears off the page. The main character will have no point of view, and some of the lesser, or minor, characters take over. The main character becomes lost in the background.

			If you examine the Problem Sheet you’ll see that almost all the symptoms seem to stem from the writers not knowing the characters well enough. Too many plot twists and turns have to be explained, and the action wanders—as in Diehard 3—the dramatic premise forgotten or unclear. This happens in Broken Arrow (Graham Yost), the John Woo film in which character is sacrificed for action. What carries the film, of course, is not the story or the characters, but the action.

			This particular problem of too much, too soon, is defined as a problem of Plot, but the symptoms we’ve been analyzing stem from Character. Why is that?

			Because to fix this kind of problem you’ve got to open up, develop, and enlarge the incidents of the story line, adding new Plot elements even though the problem evolves from Character.

			For example, a woman was writing a story that takes place in the sixteenth century about a band of traveling musicians. The main character is a young woman, deeply in love and recently married, whose husband, when the story opens, is accidentally killed in a river accident. Right after the funeral, her father is determined to marry her to an old man, a very rich and respected merchant, but she refuses and will not obey his commands or honor his wishes. She doesn’t know what to do, but when she’s invited to a lord’s estate to cure his young son (she’s set up to be a natural healer), she allows herself to be seduced by him. Her action permits her to get out of the unbearable situation with her father, but sets her apart from the others in the band. She is filled with pride and independence and no one is going to tell her what to do. Especially when it concerns her feelings.

			The nobleman is enchanted with her, but when he learns she has used him (he was only a solution to a problem, after all) he vows that if he can’t have her, no one else will either. So he sets into motion a plan that will keep her as a prisoner in his castle. And we know that if she ever goes to prison, this free spirit will literally wither and die.

			That’s basically the story, and it works well. When my student began writing the screenplay, she began hurrying the action, putting in too much information because she thought she had to explain how the musicians lived, what their society was like, and their interrelationships within this musical clan. She structured Act I this way, opening with the group crossing a raging river, when suddenly the husband falls into a swirling eddy and can’t swim against the mighty current and drowns. The young wife rushes to him, but it’s too late. The funeral follows, and immediately following the ceremony her father tells her that he has sold her to the old man, the merchant, and she must marry him. She can’t deal with it and flees, but after a few weeks the young widow is summoned to the nobleman’s estate to cure his son. The son recovers, the nobleman becomes infatuated with her, and she determines that he is the answer to her prayers and lets herself be seduced.

			Being seduced by the nobleman is the Plot Point at the end of Act I. It gives us enough time to set up the death, the relationships within the band, and establish the dramatic premise. The dramatic and visual possibilities are strong, the emotional opportunities rich. The narrative flow of events gives us a good insight into the arena of life of the traveling musicians.

			But the woman was still insecure about the story and wrote everything that should happen in Act I into the first ten pages. She literally shoved everything together so the main character meets the nobleman by page 10. As a result, everything happens so fast that nothing is really developed; all the insights that could give us a full and rich portrait of the characters were omitted. In terms of story, there was too much information being given too soon. Everything was mashed together and the events simply rode on the surface of the story like a leaf floating on the water.

			When I explained that she had too much information in these first pages, she did not really know how to fix it. I told her she had to go back into her characters in order to get more material, so as to develop Act I more completely. So I gave her an exercise: I had her write a free-association essay about the main character’s emotional state; what her feelings were for her husband/lover during their courtship and marriage.

			Then I had her develop an emotional back story to her character; what happened between wife and husband immediately before the story begins. Maybe they had an argument the morning before crossing the river; maybe they had just finished making love and vowed their love for each other. I had her describe the character’s feelings of grief and loss, her anger at being left behind without him, and her fury and frustration at being bound by the constraints of this unwritten law.

			The exercise helped the woman approach some of those emotional bridges that have to be crossed in order to develop character. When she became more familiar with her character’s emotional life, I had her take each one of the events she had written in those first ten pages, and separate them into individual sequences with a beginning, middle, and end. I had her write them all out, in a page-or-two essay; when she finished, she could add and create new material that would allowed her to open up the fertile landscape of her story.

			A sequence, remember, is a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end. A funeral, a wedding (Four Weddings and a Funeral is really five sequences strung together), a chase, a shootout, and so on.

			Here’s how we broke it down for Act I: The band moving toward the river then crossing the river is one sequence; being swept away and the chase leading to the young husband’s death, another; her reaction to the loss, her mourning, the funeral, another. All these sequences are complete within themselves and can be structured individually into beginning, middle, and end. Because the new material has to be expanded, structured, and woven into the story line, it brings more depth and dimension to the emotional needs of the character.

			That’s why it’s a problem of Plot, though it encompasses elements of both Structure and Character. The solution to this particular problem is more easily approached from the perspective of Plot; that is, we add events to the story line in order to develop the dramatic action more fully. I’m sure it would be easier if we could clearly and conveniently separate each problem into its own little category complete unto itself, but that’s not the way it works. In life, as in screenwriting, everything is related to everything else.

			Because Plot, Character, and Structure are the foundations of screenwriting, they will always be interrelated, though certain problems can be approached more easily via one category than another.

			You could also solve this kind of problem by approaching it from the category of Structure or Character. It really doesn’t matter how you approach the problem as long as you identify and define it.

			What’s most important is to find the right way to set up your story; find the picture, or the scene, that best illustrates the story and the character. As mentioned, in Apollo 13, the script opens with Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) and other astronauts at a party, watching Neil Armstrong’s landing on the moon. The picture on TV and the simple comments by the characters let us know immediately that these people are involved in the space mission to the moon. Within the first ten pages we know that Jim Lovell’s dream, his dramatic premise, is to return to the moon.

			All this information has been set up simply and economically by the screenwriter’s knowledge of who these characters are, what their dramatic need is, what the story is about, and the circumstances surrounding the action. What’s set up in Jim Lovell’s case is that he knows he may never fly to the moon again because of the accident in the Apollo spacecraft.

			This is just good screenwriting. Everything we need to know, we know within this first ten-page unit of dramatic action. It sets up the story so that Plot Point I, the true beginning of the story, is the blastoff into space for the Apollo 13 mission. And thus the temptation to set up the story through dialogue has been avoided.

			When you think you have a problem, go back into the material and reread it from the point of view that maybe too much is happening too soon. Is the front end of your screenplay, the first 10 pages, overloaded with information, characters, or events? Is so much happening so fast that the reader becomes lost or does the major focus of the story line seem lost?

			The Need to Explain


			Recently, I read a screenplay about a boat builder on the coast of the Yucatán who is forced out of business by an unscrupulous politician demanding bribes and he reacts by floundering in a lifestyle of drunkenness and bankruptcy. He becomes his own victim. Since the story is about his redemption, we see him go through his transformation by joining a rebel action to help bring about the fall of a Central American dictator.

			It is a good action piece, has great visual locations, and has the potential to be a good vehicle for the character’s growth, change, and development. But the screenplay didn’t read that way and the story’s potential was never realized. And here’s why.

			The writer opens the screenplay with a scene where the main character delivers a boat, which he has been commissioned to build for the politician. Everything seems fine; there are nice visuals but no real conflict as the scene is meant to reveal the extraordinary design abilities of the main character, the builder. The boat he has built is literally a piece of art. And, the way the scene is written, both characters seem satisfied with the transaction.

			Cut to five years later. The main character is now struggling for work, has the reputation of being unreliable, an alcoholic, and we see him lose several jobs. And his design abilities are never again mentioned or play any significant part in the rest of the screenplay.

			At Plot Point I, needing money, he accepts a job as a crew member on a large fishing boat, and during a severe storm the boat is shipwrecked farther up the coast. Forced to remain in this thinly populated area while they repair the boat, they discover a band of guerrillas who enlist them in their cause to overthrow the local political dictator, a man groomed and supported by the same unscrupulous politician that ran the main character out of business. He joins them and takes the first steps along his journey of repentance that leads to recognizing his own self-worth and regaining his dignity as a person.

			That’s the story. During the first part of my read things seemed okay, but around page 30 I began to notice that my attention was wandering, and the more I read the more aware I became of it. So I knew something was wrong; something was not working as well as it should. I started looking for the source of the problem. What I began to see was that the main character was constantly reacting to the situation, and somehow he seemed to be lost on the page in relationship to the other characters. He was involved in every scene, yes, but he seemed bland and uninteresting, and just seemed to disappear off the page.

			The first symptom.

			I went back to the very beginning of the screenplay, and started looking. When I examined the opening scene between the builder and the politician, I saw there was no conflict at all between the two men, either internal or external. And in the next scene, when the writer cuts into the story five years later, we see the reaction to the man’s plight. What I saw immediately is the main character was always explaining his actions, his situation, his life, to the other characters. That stopped the forward flow of the story as the character has to justify why he is here, what he is feeling, what his dramatic need is. Because the reader isn’t shown the character falling into the pit of hard times during those five years, he or she has to be informed what happened. If you don’t show it, you have to say it; you have to explain it for the story to move forward. And when that happens your character is lost on the page, caught in the web of talking heads.

			We don’t have to explain everything in a screenplay; we just have to know what happens. It’s not a question of not explaining anything, it’s a question of how the explanation is written. In Apollo 13 the very first shot under the credits is the actual newsreel footage of the first Apollo astronauts caught in the fire in the space capsule. Three lives were lost, and if we didn’t see this, we would have to explain it, because it is the spark that ignites the whole story, moving Jim Lovell’s crew up to the Apollo 13 slot in the NASA schedule.

			Many times during the screenplay the screenwriter will have the urge, or the need, to explain things—things about the character, things about the situation, things about the story—because if something is not clear, it has to be explained. It is one of the most common problems screenwriters encounter. The process of screenwriting always remains the same, but the creative problems are always different. If there is an action scene, and we don’t know what’s happening, it has to be explained at some point in order to keep the story moving forward. That’s the only way to hold the reader or audience’s interest.

			Exposition is a key element in the craft of screenwriting. The word itself is defined as the “information necessary to move the story forward.”

			There are two ways to write exposition; set it up through dialogue, or dramatize it through pictures. Exposition is the easiest, yet the hardest, dialogue to write. It states the obvious, which makes it easy, because the screenwriter simply puts down what needs to be said in order to move the story forward; hard, because the dialogue is usually so obvious, it’s embarrassing.

			How do you solve this? By finding ways to dramatize the exposition. By finding the right visual image, or metaphor, to serve the story line.

			Broken Arrow opens with a fight scene in which Deke (John Travolta) is boxing with his air force copilot, Hale (Christian Slater). Who these characters are, and the forces working upon them, are revealed by their actions. Deke doesn’t hesitate to use any maneuver he can to defeat Hale. Hale believes in the rules, fighting hard to win, but never sacrificing his humanity. There is a dialogue between the two men within the riveting action of this scene, and it reveals everything we need to know about their characters throughout the film. And, in the end, the motivation, or purpose, behind Deke’s plan to steal two nuclear weapons only needs to be explained in a few lines of dialogue.

			In Jurassic Park we create the explanation of the story, the premise, in the little interactive presentation that the Sir Richard Attenborough character puts on for his visitors. In his demonstration that is part animation and interactive live action, he explains that mosquitoes in the Jurassic Park era would feed off the dinosaur’s blood, then get trapped in tree sap, which would fossilize to amber. Now, millions of years later, the amber is pierced and the mosquito fossil’s blood siphoned off, and through the advancement of genetic technology we have been able to create dinosaur clones.

			That’s the entire premise of the movie. If we don’t believe that, then “there is no willing suspension of disbelief” and the story becomes a joke.

			So, how do they set this up? They explain it, sure, with both pictures and images. But first you have to grab the reader or the audience’s attention, so the script opens with an action sequence that reeks of mystery and suspense. That’s Spielberg’s great gift as a filmmaker. We don’t yet know what’s going on, but we know something really big and mean is inside that cage of steel and it’s very, very dangerous.

			Take a look at this sequence again. Nothing is explained. All we can do is watch as one of the technicians is yanked and hurled around like a piece of lettuce in a tossed salad. And at the end of the sequence we still don’t know what’s going on. But we’re hooked; that’s why in action-oriented films, or certain types of mysteries or thrillers, the writer opens with an action sequence that needs to be explained at some point during the story. It’s called the “inciting incident.” A primary rule in screenwriting is that we discover what’s going on at the same time the character does. The main character and the reader or audience are connected by the mutual effort of trying to figure out what’s going on.

			Things have to be explained; sometimes through words, sometimes through pictures. It all depends on the type of screenplay you’re writing.

			The premise established, we meet the main characters, Sam Neill and Laura Dern, in the Badlands of South Dakota, working the dinosaur digs, using the latest computer technology to isolate the fossil remains of some prehistoric animal. A helicopter lands, bringing the Attenborough character, who convinces the two scientists that if they come with him and “sign off” on his project, he will fund their research digs for the next three years. They can’t say no to that. They do need funds to continue their research project. So, they cannot “not” go.

			That’s the first ten pages of the screenplay; nothing is explained, but it’s all been set up, the situation demonstrated.

			Now the second ten pages of dramatic action begin, and here it becomes necessary to establish exposition; there is the need to explain. As the characters drive through the open landscape, they see their first dinosaurs, living and breathing and roaming as they were during the Jurassic Period. It’s like being lost on an island in time. Again, as we see the explanation, we don’t need to explain it through dialogue.

			And this is where the questions of “how they do it” and “why they do it” become important and do need to be explained. That’s when we have the little interactive presentation explaining the science and technology, set amid the activity of the high-tech laboratory. The other characters are introduced and now we’re ready to begin the “true” story.

			At Plot Point I they enter Jurassic Park and the massive gates swing shut. Everything has been set up and explained, the characters introduced. Some explanations are part of the visual arena; for example, when they enter the park they see a cow being hoisted into a compound. The young girl is appalled as we hear a vicious roar, then witness a lot of activity within the trees and then we see the empty harness, broken and bloody, being lifted out. Nothing needs to be said; no words are necessary. It’s feeding time. We see the same thing with a goat chained to a post. Sitting. Waiting. A short time later, after the storm hits, we see only the chain swinging back and forth, empty. Then the T-rex is upon them.

			A screenplay is a story told with pictures, so we have to create the pictures that reveal the story and keep it moving forward; then exposition and the need to explain are kept at a minimum.

			The problem with so many screenwriters is that they rely too heavily on dialogue to move the story forward. In some screenplays, like the one mentioned at the front of this chapter, scene after scene deals with some kind of explanation about something that’s already happened.

			The result: the story moves too slowly, and seems to wander in several different directions. And despite the characters’ constantly seeming to explain themselves, the impression is that they are not well-defined, are passive instead of active. Washed out on the page. In the story about the boat builder in the Caribbean, it became necessary for the screenwriter to explain everything because certain scenes had been omitted in the story line. That makes it a problem of Plot.

			In Jurassic Park the exposition is presented with a combination of visual elements in order to move the story forward; the introduction of the Sam Neill and Laura Dern characters on the fossil dig in the South Dakota Badlands shows us who these characters are, so the story doesn’t become bogged down in explanations, as the writers weave the threads of the story line.

			When you’re writing a screenplay you have to explain things, that’s part of the nature of the medium, but the real question is in how you do it. Whether through dialogue or pictures.

			Think about it. If you feel there’s something not quite working in your script, take a look at the Problem Sheet and see whether you’re explaining too much. Here’s what you can do.

			First, you’re dealing with an action and a character, and then you’re creating conflict, so we have to know what your character is thinking and feeling in this particular situation. If you start explaining too many things, your story line becomes confused or complex, because you always have to explain what’s happening to your main character. To fix it you have to add elements to the story line (Plot), and many times these dramatic events seem somewhat contrived and predictable. And if your story is moving forward mainly through dialogue, it becomes talking heads, and when that happens some of the lesser characters start taking over the action.

			To solve this kind of problem you need to rethink your story from two points of view, from the visual as well as the character aspect. Do your scenes have enough of a visual dynamic? Or, do they take place in offices, rooms, and restaurants? In other words, does your screenplay go from INTERIOR to INTERIOR to INTERIOR to INTERIOR with hardly any EXTERIORS anywhere? If you are explaining things too much, one of the first symptoms you look for is whether the story is too closed or too narrow, and if it is, then you have to open it up visually.

			Here’s an example from a script that one of my students wrote. The story, a period piece set in the forties, is about a woman pilot who wants to compete in an aerial race flying a World War II fighter plane that has only been flown by men. During the story she has to battle the prejudice against her, her own fear that she may not be able to do it, as well as other obstacles. And because there is a lot of information that has to be given about the main character, the writer started to explain too many things.

			First, I have to say that this entire exercise is taken out of context and is totally speculative. The scene I’m going to excerpt is between the main character, Kate, and her boyfriend, Holt, also a pilot, who reluctantly supports her in her quest to be the first woman to fly this plane in competition.

			 				KATE

				I’m a little nervous, that’s all. Whatever possessed me to think I could do this?



			 				HOLT

				This…meaning, the race? How is this different from mounting an exhibit at the museum?

				(where she works)

				You plot, plan, research, study, talk to a lot of people, and the day the thing opens, you’re a wreck.



			 				KATE

				Do you think of Chris? Ever?

				(a friend who died flying the same plane)



			 				HOLT

				Sure. He was my best friend. I think of him a lot. Especially today. He’d be real proud of you.



			 				KATE

				You think so?



			 				HOLT

				I know it.

				(He hugs her)

				You scared?



			 				KATE

				A little.



			 				HOLT

				Good. A little scared is good. It keeps you alert….Hey, if you’re not good enough, you won’t qualify here either. But if you do qualify, you’re as good as any man up there.



			 				KATE

				(grinning)

				Maybe better.



			 				HOLT

				Maybe. You’ll enjoy it, once it starts. You’ll see. I love you, Kate, I don’t want you to do anything you don’t want to do. We can quit now. Just tell me what you want to do.

				(She looks at him)

				That’s what I thought.



			He lifts her from her perch and carries her to the bed.

			 				HOLT

				We have plenty of time before your briefing.



			And, then we cut to the next scene at the airport.

			Words and phrases like nervous, scared, Do you think about Chris? I love you, all explain feelings, they don’t show them. When that happens, the dialogue becomes too direct and tells us what the characters are thinking and feeling. That seems to empty the lines of conflict, and the scene becomes bland and somewhat dull. There is no subtext in the scene; the subtext is what is not said during the scene, all those hidden thoughts or feelings that are the core of what the scene is really all about.

			What’s the best way to fix this?

			I think to really be effective, this particular scene has to be structured from the very beginning of the scene. It should be mentioned that this kind of problem can be solved either through Plot or Character. I am approaching it through Plot because we have to see Kate in her environment to know that she can actually compete and hold her own in the flying race. That means we have to see her flying the plane more, so we can learn how she handles it, and the ideal way to do that would be to show her flying the plane and being unable to control it on some level; maybe she finds it difficult to land, or she loses control of the plane and finds it very difficult to regain control in the air. We need to create some conflict with her, something that might put her in jeopardy. This is missing in the screenplay. To show that also means showing her in various stages of her professional, personal, and private life. (That’s why this solution is approached from the category of Plot.)

			For example, Holt says that in an exhibit at the museum (Kate is assistant director), “you plot, plan, research, study, talk to a lot of people, and the day the thing opens, you’re a wreck.” All true, but we’ve not seen this side of her character yet in the screenplay. We’ve only seen bits and pieces of her at the museum, and never under any kind of stress or pressure. In order to really open up the script, we have to show her in some kind of emergency situation, which she handles. All drama is conflict. As I like to say, without conflict there is no action; without action there is no character; without character there is no story. And without story there is no screenplay.

			What makes The Silence of the Lambs so effective is that Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a student at the FBI Academy and over and over again we see her in the training environment. We see her skill with a gun, in hostagelike situations, on the firing range, in the library, and she discovers the severed head of a murder victim, so we know that when she comes face to face with the serial killer in the basement, she can hold her own. We know that she can take care of herself, and this has carefully been structured into the story line from the very beginning. The first time we see her she’s running the obstacle course, and we learn in the next scene that she ranks in the upper quarter of her class, comprised of both men and women.

			If we had not seen that she could take care of herself in dangerous situations, then the ending of the film would have been totally unsatisfying; there would be no “willing suspension of disbelief” and we wouldn’t buy it at all.

			In the story about the woman pilot, a possible way to approach the scene and make it more visually effective without explaining things is to add new scenes to set up this scene. Then you can use the emotional currents to make it more potent and energetic. That’s why the problem can be solved through Plot.

			We can also approach it from Character, and that means going deeper into the relationship between Kate and Holt. In this particular draft of the script Kate and Holt have been together a little over two years. We don’t know much about this relationship, other than what has been explained through the dialogue. He’s there for her, supportive in her need, but there’s no past to this relationship. It has to be created by the writer, with written essays about how they met, their past relationships; who they were with, how long it lasted, what happened that led to their breakup. These things have to be known, otherwise they will not be defined and will have to be explained.

			There’s another part of the scene that can be explored, and that’s the relationship with “Chris,” the friend of Holt’s who died in a plane crash before the story begins. So far, he’s only been talked about, never shown. That’s the kind of scene that would affect the present scene directly; Chris’s crash was not included in the script, but if we had seen it, and its effect on the characters, we might have been able to set up the relationship between Holt and Chris as well as between Kate and Chris. If we knew this relationship, we could get deeper into the emotional context of the scene at hand. Both characters could be struggling with their feelings in this scene; Holt with his memory of Chris, and his fear for Kate, and Kate in her relationship with Chris, her own fear she must confront, and her relationship with Holt, the man she loves. Remember Top Gun; it’s this element of the Tom Cruise character conquering his own fear that drives the entire screenplay. It would add a much deeper dimension to the scene.

			Instead, all the emotional nuances of the scene are approached through dialogue, explained rather than seen or felt. Because the emotional forces working on the scene were not prepared deeply enough, the presentation seems confined to the surface, lacking in depth. We don’t know what Kate’s thoughts and feelings are except what she says.

			It’s true that this is only one scene in the entire screenplay. But look how indicative it is; the whole screenplay is written in this tone, and it lacks a force and an energy that should be driving a story like this. Film is a visual medium and it must be approached both through its action and its character.

			Otherwise, you just have to explain everything.

			Something’s Missing


			When I’m reading a screenplay, I’m always looking for a story line that’s lean, clean, and tight. I want the characters to move through the narrative landscape with a strong dramatic need and strong point of view. I want to be surprised and don’t want the story to seem contrived or predictable, and I want all scenes and sequences to be related to one another, where nothing, neither a throwaway action nor a line of dialogue, is tossed in just to keep the story moving forward.

			It’s what I call “the good read.” Unfortunately, I’m disappointed most of the time. The same goes for almost all the readers in Hollywood, no matter if it’s a studio executive, producer, director, development person, or reader. Personally, I’m directly involved in the reading and writing of about a thousand screenplays a year; either I’m commissioned to read them by various producers and production companies, or I’m working with my many students and helping them design and develop their screenplays. Over and over again I find certain tendencies within the screenplay that lead directly to a particular problem; as mentioned in Chapter 8, either there is too much material fueling the story, or not enough; something is missing.

			Many times during the screenwriting process the screenwriter is faced with the creative choice of whether to write a particular scene or not write it. Sometimes a tendency develops where writers will skip scenes that they think are unimportant and unnecessary, scenes they think they could do without. If you find that you start asking yourself “whether I really need to write this scene or not,” you begin a critical process of making a judgment. And while that is a positive and necessary step in the screenwriting process, if overdone it can lead to a creative decision that results in your not writing the scene. And once this process has been formed as part of the writing process, once you get into the pattern of saying, “No, I don’t need to write this scene,” for whatever reason—you establish the habit of saying no.

			Then you’re in trouble.

			Inevitably, something will be missing in the screenplay; most of the time it will be something important or significant to the action, a key scene or sequence that must be there for the story to move forward. When I was a consultant on White Palace (Alvin Sargent), with Susan Sarandon and James Spader, there was a significant transition at the end of the Second Act. The James Spader character makes a decision to follow Susan Sarandon to New York. But the way the script was written did not give us any clue that the character was going to leave; there was a scene, and then the next scene showed him arriving in New York. How he got there, when he made the decision, why he made the decision, was never addressed during this particular draft of the screenplay. Just that he goes.

			When I first read this section of the script, I was very confused. It just didn’t make sense, especially in light of what happens between the two characters when they encounter each other again. It was a major omission; without this key scene of the Spader character making the decision to leave and follow Sarandon to New York, there was a big, gaping hole in the action. It had to be filled. Such a scene was not only important, it was a structural necessity, for this scene is really the Plot Point at the end of the Second Act.

			When something is missing in the screenplay, either a scene or sequence, a character’s decision or reaction, it will always get in the way of the action, because we can intuitively feel something is not there that should be.

			One of my students was writing an action-adventure script about the rescue of an American airman who had been shot down and captured by a guerrilla force in North Korea. And while there were many action scenes, literally one after the other, the writer had omitted saying anything about this character, about what his life was like before his capture, or his family, or what information he had, or his hopes and fears; even in Crimson Tide we see the Denzel Washington character at his daughter’s birthday party just before he receives the phone call about the Russian threat. And in the setup of the Gene Hackman character something is said about the navy being his “real family.” We also see his relationship with his dog, and that reveals a great deal about him. It’s not just action scene after action scene.

			Most of the character dynamic that makes a screenplay really effective, no matter if it’s an action-adventure, or thriller, or relationship story, was clearly missing in my student’s pages. And it was pretty obvious.

			Good screenwriting is a blend of strong action and strong character. They go hand in hand.

			How can you correct something like that? In this case I had my student stop his writing and go back and do more character work. First I had him write several essays about the main character, then suggested some character elements that might be woven into the screenplay. In my student’s story the main character is a loner; shot down behind enemy lines, captured, no one to talk to—this creates a situation where a flashback, or what I like to call a “flashpresent,” would work very well. For example, as the character’s plane is plummeting to the earth we could possibly see, in very quick cuts, various elements of his life. As he yanks his ejector seat, we could possibly see bits and pieces of his life; a scene with his mother, maybe a shot of his wife, or a child playing with a little dog, or a beautiful sunset. These are just some visual suggestions that could open up the script so as to incorporate some character elements into the action. He parachutes into the trees, then there’s an action scene of him being hunted down and captured. The screenwriter had become so totally involved in the action elements of the screenplay that he had completely neglected the character.

			Something was missing. It was a real problem.

			Any creative decision you make about whether to write a particular scene or not is a necessary and essential step in the screenwriting process. But following the question about whether or not you need the scene, instead of following what’s needed for the story to work, leads to a screenplay that reads “thin,” with no tension or suspense, and obvious plot holes that need to be explained in order for the story to move forward.

			And failure to take care of and fill these particular plot holes will often lead to stories, and characters, that are thin and one-dimensional. We call this type of screenplay a “one-line” film.

			Sometimes, a one-line film works very effectively: Speed (Graham Yost) and Broken Arrow are good examples of an idea pushed to its extreme, with just enough character delineation to make it interesting. Il Postino is brilliant.

			But The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain is a good example of a “one-line” script that doesn’t work. The story, about an English surveyor and his partner, assigned to reclassify a hill into a mountain in Wales right after the First World War, is a cute premise, cleverly laid out, but extremely simple in terms of style and execution.

			The title says it all; that’s what the entire script is about, and there’s nothing more to it than this particular situation. That’s what this movie really is, a situation, not a story, and for that reason the conflict and tension inherent in the story seem lost; is this mountain really a hill, or is this hill really a mountain? That’s the only real tension that powers the story forward.

			The stakes are not high enough—that is, the emotional stakes. What’s at stake in this story? Not much of anything. The people here have nothing to lose. To make it work more dramatically, more effectively, the emotional intensity has to be higher; that means the conflict has be increased. Something of value, whether emotional or physical, internal or external, has to be at stake, or at risk. A character’s strong dramatic need will generate more conflict only if there are obstacles that must be overcome. If this is the case, you’ve got to go into the character’s life and find the element or elements that can raise the emotional stakes of the situation.

			Why? Take a look at Anson, the Hugh Grant character; he is weak and passive and always seems to be reacting to the situation and other characters. We really don’t know too much about him, and he literally disappears into the background of the story. There is nothing about his character, or in his character, to draw and focus our attention on him. He has nothing at stake. The barkeeper, Morgan, on the other hand, is a much more dynamic character. Even the character of the Reverend is portrayed with more gusto and life, and stands out more than Anson. The love relationship with the Betsy character seems predictable and contrived, as if it’s just thrown in because there has to be a “love interest” in every script. And why she’s attracted to this shell-shocked wimp is, at least to my mind, a total mystery. We know he was shell shocked, but we don’t know anything about him, and how this has affected him. She is a strong and attractive woman. Why would she consent to be with this kind of a man? Is she his savior? A rescuer? A distraught mother? We don’t know, we can only guess.

			So, what’s the problem?

			Something’s missing. First of all, the main character is never really defined. The conflict itself is weak and results in very little tension or suspense because the characters are always reacting to the situation; except for Morgan they are not driven by their passions and emotions, only by their need to make this particular hill fall into the category of being listed as a mountain.

			Why is that so important? This is the first hole that needs to be filled. It’s never really explained. They talk about it, yes, they discuss it, yes, but there is no underlying reason, or motivation, to take this simple conflict seriously. As a result, the story is thin and contrived, the plot line weak. Why these Welsh people of Fynnor Gawr cared so much whether the “British” declared their summit a hill or a mountain is never really established. This might have been a fierce struggle, storywise, for the Welsh are a proud and independent people. Couldn’t there have been some kind of conflict spawned the English forcing their laws and their way of life upon the Welsh? The natural rivalry inherent in the story could have been the natural abrasion that might have added more depth and dimension to the story line.

			If you feel your story is too thin, or missing something, or if the stakes are not high enough, or if you feel the characters are talking too much, or they all sound alike, or nothing happens, go back over the material and determine whether you’ve spent enough time setting up the conflict in the story. You can also add color, or create conflict and texture to your characterizations. In The Englishman…the Hugh Grant character is weak because we don’t know enough about him. We don’t know much about his background, about how his shell-shock experience has affected him; we don’t know whether he longs for a secure and loving relationship, or must overcome a long and deep-seated conflict of prejudice against the Welsh. These are all potential areas of character conflict that might have been explored and expanded to offer a more interesting and dramatic dimension to the story. If these areas had been explored, the film would have been much more than a “one-liner.” Sometimes, when the material is thin, and something seems to be missing, look for a subplot to weave into the action. A subplot is an additional plotline that becomes a secondary branch of the story line. Adding a subplot is a good idea sometimes, and sometimes not, depending on the story. Many writers I know are convinced that every story needs a subplot, so they always try to find a way to inject one.

			There are two ways to approach creating a subplot; either adding another element to the narrative line of your script through the action, or building it from character. That’s your first creative decision, because all subplots are a function either of action or of character. The purpose of a subplot is to add more solid dramatic possibilities to your story line; to open up the action so the script becomes more visual, and to fill in any pieces of missing action to sharpen and define the conflict.

			Because the subplot springs from action and character, it means you have to create the particular incidents and events and then structure and weave them through the dramatic action. That’s why you solve this particular problem by approaching it from Plot as well as Character.

			If you build your subplot based on the Character, you will have to create more obstacles to the story line. For example, if your character is a doctor who’s searching for a cure for AIDS, and he’s almost found it, you might think about creating a subplot about another doctor who is competing with the main character and possibly has found another cure for the same disease. In medical terms it’s important to be the first to discover a cure, because that’s what attracts the funding and research dollars. So, maybe the character’s dramatic need might be to be the first person to discover the cure. This sets up an additional conflict where the main character is racing against, and challenging, this other character, to be the first to find the cure for AIDS. A subplot like this becomes a very effective way to add and build more dimension into the story line.

			How would you go about building this particular subplot? First, you have to create the other character, in this case a doctor doing research with AIDS, and then find out who he or she is by writing a character biography. Maybe these two doctors have had some contact in the past, either before the story starts, or through various research publications; maybe they even went to school together. You can establish this information through the character biography by writing various essays clarifying and defining the dramatic forces working on these two characters. This secondary character will be a major figure in the story, even if he or she is in only a few scenes in the script. Setting up a situation this way allows you to select scenes that will add depth to the plot.

			By clarifying and defining what brings a new character into the conflict, and how the main character reacts to this new situation, you generate a whole series of actions and reactions that will hook into the main story line. You are creating additional action to the story, a subplot that will give the script a new look and feel. Many writers actually develop the subplot as a separate story, then structure it on the Paradigm and then weave it through the dramatic action. That’s why it’s listed more as a problem of Plot than of Character.

			Whenever you feel you need to cut away from the main action, you can now insert scenes from the subplot and create a much stronger narrative line.

			If you want to build a subplot based on action, here’s the perfect example: Ransom, the Ron Howard film with Mel Gibson and Rene Russo, from an original script by Alexander Ignon, and rewritten by Richard Price (Clockers). The script is about the kidnapping of a child of a wealthy family and the physical and emotion toll it takes upon them.

			In the first draft of the screenplay the action concentrated on the family and how they dealt with the ordeal, how it affected their relationship. The kidnapping was only the “hook” to focus on the characters during the time of their emotional ordeal. And the point of the story was that people are all the same; rich or poor, man or woman, black, white, brown, or yellow, when the lives of children are at stake, the emotional reality experienced is really the same for everybody. Feelings are feelings.

			Which is basically the point of the story. But when Richard Price came onto the project, he became aware that, while it was a great situation as written, something seemed to be missing; the script wasn’t as strong as it could be. Ron Howard agreed. When they reread the original material from this perspective, they became aware that during the entire screenplay there was nothing about the kidnappers, nothing about the kidnappers’ point of view. Who are these people? Why did they kidnap this particular child? How does the kidnapping affect the parents and the kidnappers? This is a bizarre and unique relationship that, if explored, could provide another dimension to the script.

			So Price started developing the kidnappers’ side of the story, and in the subplot we’re able to see who these people are and why they’ve chosen to commit this crime.

			The subplot opened up the entire screenplay, giving it a richness it had not had before.

			If you want to build and develop a subplot based on Character, go back into your character’s life and redefine it; you’re looking for elements of his or her life that would lend themselves to the story and add another facet to the conflict. You can find them by going into your character’s professional life, his personal life, and his private life.

			What does your main character do for a living? What is his or her profession? What are the relationships between your main character and the people he or she works with? Good? Bad? Are there any conflicts between your character and the people he or she works with? What are they? Has a particular project gone astray? A payment that wasn’t made? Does your character socialize with her office mates after work? What does she do? Is she having an affair? Are her parents alive? Is she sick, or healthy? Write an essay of two or three pages laying this all out. Free-associate and just throw all your thoughts and ideas down; again, don’t worry about grammar or spelling or writing fragments. Just toss the words down on the paper. This is automatic writing, and you’ll be amazed at what you discover. Writing is always an act of discovery, and you never really know what’s going to come out. That’s what makes it such an exhilarating experience. It’s an incredible high.

			If you define these elements of your character’s professional life, you will find some kind of incident or event you can hook into to build the subplot.

			What about your character’s personal life? What are the relationships your main character has during the course of the screenplay? Is he married, single, widowed, divorced, or separated? Can you define these relationships? If your character is single, is he or she in some kind of a relationship when the story begins? What state is the relationship in? Is it good, or falling apart? Think of conflict here; it’s much better, at least dramatically, to have a relationship that’s not in the best shape. Two people who are happy together have very little dramatic value. So create some conflict: perhaps the passion has fallen away, or he’s having an affair, or she feels that she’s being taken for granted.

			If your character is married, what’s the relationship like? Is it strong and stable, or is one of the partners questioning his or her commitment? How long have they been married? Are there any children? How many? Define your main character’s marriage in a two- or three-page essay and see if you can pull any elements out that may help you build and structure some kind of a subplot. Look for those specific elements that will expand the boundaries of the story line.

			You can also do it through your character’s private life. Private life means what your character does when he or she is alone. What hobbies, or interests, does your character have? Taking a class in cooking? A writing class? Looking for “buys” while surfing the Net? Working out three or four times a week? What kind of workout? Yoga? Weights? Dance classes? All these areas can be explored and easily offer a variety of creative choices in terms of developing subplots.

			Pets are another way you can add incidents and elements to your screenplay. Does your character have any pets? If so, what kind? As mentioned, in Crimson Tide the Gene Hackman character comes on board his submarine with his little dog. The serial killer Jame Gumb, in The Silence of the Lambs, has a little fat poodle, “Precious.” Pets are a wonderful way to add depth and sympathy to your character.

			You can even use this dramatically in the story. I had an experience one night a few years ago. I had a very important dinner meeting. But about an hour before I was to leave, I suddenly noticed my cat, about seventeen years old, was not well. She had great difficulty breathing and was unable to move. I dropped everything and immediately took her to receive emergency treatment. I knew I was going to be late for the meeting, but as far as I was concerned, I had no choice in the matter. The cat was my first priority. So, I took her to the animal emergency center, the vet examined her, gave her some shots, and kept her overnight. I went on to the meeting, and while everything appeared normal, at least on the surface, my thoughts and feelings were with my cat. And it was that situation or incident that could create a dramatic subplot. If I was looking for some kind of incident or episode to bulk up my screenplay from the function of Character, this kind of incident or event would be a perfect vehicle.

			As I recall, I had a very tough time that night. My cat was given an injection and some pills, and came home the next day. But an incident like this can add depth to your characters and fill in some of the missing holes in your story line.

			Just remember that you can approach writing a subplot either through action or character. Each is an effective way to build substance and dimension to the story line, and provides information that moves the story forward visually, rather than verbally. If you have set up the elements of the subplot, and they are clearly established and defined, then you can follow them easily as they surface through the story line, like dolphins breaking the waves.

			Another Time, Another Place: Bridging Time and Action


			A look at the Problem Sheet reveals a lot of common problems that plague screenplays. Many times I’ll read a screenplay and within the first ten pages I can make a fairly accurate “read” of the material. I look for a lean, clean, visual style, with an economy of story, the characters and their actions clear and concise. If there are too many characters, or too much action, or too many long-winded scenes, the chances are the script will be overlong, say more than 145 pages. If that’s the case, the story line might be too broad, too expansive, too big in scope, resulting in the main character’s not being clearly defined; or there may be too many characters, or too many scenes where the main character is not involved, or a story line that covers too much time and too much action.

			Scripts that span a number of years, like The Shawshank Redemption, are very difficult to write because the time frame is very long and there may be too many incidents that have to be covered and explained. There’s too much going on. So when you’re working on a subject that covers a long period of time, you have to know what problems you’re going to be confronting.

			Apollo 13 is a script like this. The story is a chronological time line that covers seven days, and what makes it difficult to write is that a series of events must happen that includes a multitude of details, and each one is contingent upon the others. I understand that the first few drafts of Apollo 13 were more than two hundred pages long. So what do you have to do to make it work effectively? If you’re not true to the “history” of the story, the circumstances and events, you’re bound to break the “willing suspension of disbelief,” and nobody will buy it. It’s just not “real” or believable, and this becomes apparent immediately. The music is there, but that’s about it.

			So how do you approach the historical film or the period piece? A script based on actual characters and events? There are many ways to approach the historical screenplay. First, of course, you have to do the textual research, reading books, magazines, or newspapers of the time and subject, finding out all you can about the period, as well as the people and the forces of the times. Personal diaries or novels of that period are also a good source. Once you’ve done the research, then you can place the historical facts into a progression of events that become the structural foundation of the screenplay.

			Then you have to decide how you’re going to end it. What incident or event will resolve your story line most effectively? Is it based on an actual incident whose ending we already know, like Apollo 13, All the President’s Men (William Goldman), or Nixon? Or will you base the ending on some kind of commentary using a scrawl over the end credits, as in Dances With Wolves? In other words, how true do you have to be to history? And the answer is simple: Be true to the facts, and the events of history, but the motivations that drive the characters can be created and entirely fictional.

			Immortal Beloved (Bernard Rose) is a script like this: if you know anything at all about Beethoven’s life, you’ll know that the events shown were obviously fabricated; if you look for “the real” Beethoven in that script, you’ll have a hard time finding him.

			If you happen to be writing a script like this, a historical or period piece, and you find that your script is too long, and too episodic, or you have too many characters, or too much seems to be going on, the first question you have to ask yourself is not “What do I keep in?” but “What do I leave out?”

			It’s the major creative decision that must be made before you even begin to approach the story, or the rewrite. If you don’t ask yourself this question, it often leads to difficulties and raises many problems, most notably selectivity. What events do I need to tell the story in the most visually effective way, and then, what can I leave out?

			One of the ways to solve this particular problem is by using transitions. The passage of time and the link between the scenes and sequences has to be conceived visually, for moving the action from one scene to the next requires a visual transition. Transitions bridge time and move the action forward quickly, visually. Whether you’re writing an original screenplay, or adapting a novel, play, magazine, or news article, each piece of film, each scene or sequence, must bridge a particular time to a particular place in order to move the story forward. To go from Point A to Point B in a screenplay requires making transitions that connect the two. If you don’t make those transitions, then you may wind up with many of the symptoms that are on the Problem Sheet.

			There are four major ways to make transitions: cutting from picture to picture, sound to sound, music to music, or special effect to special effect. There can be dissolves, fadeouts, and smash cuts.

			It wasn’t too long ago that the screenwriter depended on the director or film editor to create these visual transitions, but at the present time most of the working screenwriters know that it is the writer’s responsibility to write the required transitions from scene to scene. One of the recognizable traits of the screenwriter in the nineties is his or her ability to write good visual transitions. And at the present time there seems to be an evolution in the style and sophistication of the art of transition. Even a script like Pulp Fiction, which is sequential and episodic, uses effective transitions so the five episodes that make up the screenplay seem to be connected into a single story line. The title page even proclaims the script is really “three stories about one story.” If Tarantino and Avary had not created those transitions, the script would have been disjointed and episodic and not worked as well as it does.

			As far as I’m concerned, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to write these transitional scenes that move the story forward and bridge time and action. Writing good transitions is also a very good way to solve a number of problems.

			Transitions have always been an integral part of the screenwriting process. From the earliest days of silent movies the craft of filmmaking has always been the same: to tell a story in pictures, building it from beginning to end with little bits and pieces of film. That’s what a screenplay is: a story told with pictures.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, for example, the passage of time is handled incredibly well. Only one shot is needed to tell us the passage of time: the large posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, and Raquel Welch visually indicate that several decades have passed by. That, and some music on the soundtrack. In How to Make an American Quilt a young woman of twenty-six is kneeling down looking at a book and we hear her in voice-over narration: “How do two separate people fuse into this thing called a couple? And if your love is that strong, then how do you still keep a little room for yourself…?” That’s what the whole film is about, and when Finn stands up, we match-cut to her as a little girl of five or six years standing up looking at the women in the quilting bee as her narration leads us directly into the story line.

			Why are transitions so important? Because when you’re reading a script, or seeing a movie, it has to flow smoothly across a time period that is usually not more than two hours. The story line has to be a seamless parade of images across the page or screen, and time becomes a relative phenomenon; days and years and decades can be condensed into seconds, a few seconds stretched into minutes, as a leap is made from one image to another. That’s one of the things that make The Shawshank Redemption such a remarkable movie; the passage of time does not draw attention to itself. It becomes an integral part of the fabric of the screenplay.

			Transitions can be as varied and as multiple as the colors in a kaleidoscope. In The Silence of the Lambs, for example, the screenwriter, Ted Tally, generally plays the last line of one scene over the first line of the next. The dialogue is used to bridge time and action and shows one way that sound can be the link connecting two different scenes. Tally ends one scene with a question, then opens the next scene by answering that question.

			This kind of overlapping transition scene has been done many times before, of course, most notably in Julia, Alvin Sargent’s Academy Award–winning screenplay adapted from Lillian Hellman’s Pentimento. But the way Tally approached his transitions pushes the boundaries of the medium in such a way that we’re not even aware of them. If you’re watching a movie and become aware of the visual transitions, or feel the “arty” influence of the director in each scene, chances are it’s not a very good film.

			The style and sophistication of the transition is evolving all the time. In Lone Star, John Sayles makes his transitions bridging time and action in a very unique way: he has the characters remain in present time, then pans the camera over to a character or a place and suddenly we have moved across time, either forward or backward. It’s very effective, extremely visual, and I think shows the remarkable versatility of Sayles as a writer and director.

			Apollo 13 is a film based on an actual historic event, and the screenwriters bridge the action by simply cutting back and forth—a technique called cross-cutting—among the three astronauts in the spacecraft and the Mission Control team in Houston. The story moves forward by action/reaction, and is held together by the events and circumstances. Thelma & Louise also moves forward by cross-cutting between the two women on the run and the policeman searching for them.

			Every screenplay has its own particular style and form in terms of transitions. An action film usually has short, quick transitions, because the film moves forward at a very rapid pace and we have to be swept up into the action. But in a character-driven piece the transitions could possibly come from silence, or looks between the characters, or dialogue. There is never any one right way to make transitions. The only criterion is whether it works or not.

			There may be times when you’re so engrossed in putting the story down on paper that you don’t even think about the transitional flow of the script. But when you finish the first or second draft, you find that you’ve written a screenplay that may be 145 pages or longer. During the actual screenwriting process that’s okay, but afterward you’re going to have to do a lot of work to cut it to a proper length. A 140-plus page screenplay is only accepted if it’s by William Goldman, Quentin Tarantino, David Koepp, or Eric Roth.

			If your screenplay is too long, and you feel there’s too much going on, too many things happening, or too many characters, look for ways to bridge the time and action. Transitions solve so many problems in screenwriting and sometimes the bridge to another time, or another place, can be as simple as changing the character’s clothes, or using match cuts, or changing the weather, or using holidays to condense the time and action.

			One of the most interesting films to use transitions as an integral part of the story is Pulp Fiction. This is a unique film in many respects, but what’s especially interesting is the way Tarantino and Roger Avary created the transitions to keep the film flowing smoothly in one single time line.

			As the title-page reads, Pulp Fiction is really “three stories about one story.” The first page of the screenplay is “The Table of Contents,” and states that there is a prologue, where the holdup begins (with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) then a story called “Vincent and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife,” another called “The Gold Watch,” and the last story, “Vincent, Jules, Jimmie, and the Wolf” (in the film the title’s been changed to “The Bonnie Situation”), which leads us into the Epilogue and the conclusion of the robbery. The use of a Prologue, which opens the script, and the Epilogue, which closes it, is called a “bookend” device; the opening scene or sequence leads into the story and the last part of the scene or sequence closes it. The Bridges of Madison County (Richard LaGravenese) is another example of the use of a “bookend” opening and closing. Despite all the five specific episodes that make up the script of Pulp Fiction, it really seems like one story. Why?

			Because of the transitions.

			All the transitions in this screenplay are character driven, and the reason the film works so effectively is that the three stories are woven together with these characters. Even though it is “three stories about one story,” the focal point always seems to be Vincent, the John Travolta character.

			The film opens in the restaurant with Tim Roth—Pumpkin—and his girlfriend, Honeybunny (Amanda Plummer); they pull out their guns and the robbery begins. We freeze at this point, then cut to Vincent and Jules driving somewhere having one of their many weighty and lengthy discussions about the difference between McDonald’s restaurants here and abroad. They seem like two nice guys until they open the trunk, pull out several guns, and make their way inside an apartment building. Their actions seem to contradict their dialogue, which makes them interesting and colorful characters. They walk up the stairs, stake out a room, all the time continuing their discussion about the moral and ethical complications of a “foot massage.” Especially Marcellus’s wife Mia’s foot massage which left the “masseur” with a very “severe speech problem.”

			It is this attitude of casual nonchalance that is so effective in the film. There have been all kinds of essays and comments and literary debates about Pulp Fiction, and they reveal the extent to which movies have become the social fingerprints of our time.

			The two hit men force their way inside the room and confront the four young men who tried to rip off Marcellus Wallace and not deliver what they said they were going to deliver, the mysterious briefcase with the light inside, and the combination 666, the devil’s numbers. (In Hitchcockian terms, the briefcase and what’s inside would be called the “McGuffin.”) As Jules quotes from the Bible (another nice character touch), Vincent and Jules kill three of the four guys in a very explosive scene. When Brett, one of the four, leaps out of the bathroom with his gun blazing, missing Vincent and Jules, it becomes “a fucking miracle,” and then we cut to:

			Marcellus’s bar, where the “boss” is telling Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer, to take a fall in the fifth round of his fight. Butch agrees, reluctantly, to deliberately lose the fight, then goes to the bar for a pack of cigarettes and is joined by Vincent, who has just arrived (wearing the funny clothes he wears in story #3), and the two exchange some words. They don’t like each other. Vincent is called in to the boss, Marcellus, who gives him an order: take his wife out to dinner.

			At this point we have a choice; in terms of story we can either follow Butch, or Vincent. We follow Vincent. We set up the encounter between Vincent and Mia when he scores some “great” heroin, and then follow him as he takes Mia out to dinner in a long and bizarre sequence, ending with her overdosing on heroin. Vincent saves her, they say their good-byes to a “memorable” evening, and we go into:

			The second story, titled “The Gold Watch.” The transition between these two stories is simply to Fade Out at the end of the Vincent/Mia sequence, and Fade In on a flashback sequence of a young Butch being told the story of his father’s gold watch that he had carried up his ass for more than six years in a Vietnamese POW camp. When the young boy reaches to take the watch, Butch wakes up in his dressing room just before the fight. We know Butch was supposed to take a fall, but we actually don’t see the fight; we cut to the taxi driver listening to the results. We hear on the driver’s radio that a fighter has died, then we see Butch leap into a Dumpster, then into the cab, and make his way to a motel, where his girlfriend is waiting for him.

			She has forgotten the gold watch at his apartment. Furious, he realizes he must go back and retrieve it, even though it may cost him his life. He has double-crossed Marcellus and he knows there will be a contract on him (executed by Vincent and Jules). Sure enough, when he returns to the apartment, and retrieves the sacred watch, Vincent emerges from the bathroom and Butch blows him away. Which is perhaps the most arresting moment in the film, because the scene is out of its normal time frame. It’s a nonlinear action. And, occurring as it does in the middle of the script, it breaks the normal linear thread of the story line. This “nonlinear” structure is what has been so instrumental in the success of the film, and become the inspiration for many others coming up in the latter part of the nineties.

			Butch escapes in his little VW and at a stoplight sees Marcellus and literally runs over him in his efforts to get away. In the ensuing somewhat comedic escape, both men are captured by two goon brothers, Ned and Zed, who lock them up in order to sodomize them. Butch escapes, but decides he cannot let Marcellus remain in the hands of these two goonies. He rescues him, again at the peril of his own life, and when Marcellus grants him a pardon, he promises to leave with his girlfriend, never to be seen again. As Mia and Vincent have agreed to reveal nothing about what happened at dinner, Marcellus and Butch make an agreement not to say anything about this incident. Life is a compromise.

			Which then brings us to the third story, “Vincent, Jules, Jimmie, and the Wolf,” though in the film the title’s been changed to “The Bonnie Situation.” Bonnie is Jimmie’s wife, the nurse who is expected home within the hour. And Jimmie (played by Tarantino) is not going to jeopardize his marriage by his wife finding a dead man in the garage. It’s a situation that needs to be handled by the Wolf, the Harvey Keitel character whom we heard Marcellus mention at the end of the previous story.

			The story begins at the end of the opening section after the Prologue, in what is really an overlapping scene from another point of view. When Jules kills the first man, the character Brett, whom we have not seen before, has been in the bathroom, a gun in hand. He listens to Jules spouting the Bible in the living room and then we hear gunshots. Muttering to himself, Brett leaps out of the bathroom firing six times at Jules and Vincent and misses each time; the bullets thud harmlessly into the wall. As Jules says, “It’s a fuckin’ miracle,” and he becomes obsessed with the fact that they’re still alive. “This is some serious shit,” he says as they drive away, the other character, Marvin, being held “captive” in the backseat. They become engrossed in an illuminating conversation, Jules declaring that they’ve survived “only by divine intervention”; Vincent disagrees, and when he turns to get Marvin’s opinion, the gun he’s holding accidentally fires and Marvin’s head is blown all over the car.

			In a panic Jules calls his friend Jimmie and they go there to clean up the car and get rid of the body. A quick call to Marcellus produces “The Wolf,” and he comes to their rescue and saves the day. The job done, the body and the car both disposed of, the two of them are hungry and go get some breakfast.

			That, of course, is the transition that leads to the coffee shop that Tim Roth and his girlfriend are going to rob. As they are having breakfast and continuing their discussion, Vincent goes to the bathroom, and when he’s gone the robbery begins, so we begin this action a little bit before it ended in the Prologue. Another nice use of nonlinear structure. The two of them thwart the holdup, permit Pumpkin and Honeybunny to leave, and then leave themselves. The end.

			This nonlinear structure works very well within the framework of the three stories, Epilogue, and Prologue. It is really what makes the film so interesting and appealing. Just for the sake of an exercise we could put these three stories, along with the Prologue and Epilogue, into a linear story line. We might open with Vincent and Jules on their way to kill the kids who were trying to rip off Marcellus. They leave, accidentally kill Marvin, go to the “Jules, Vincent, Jimmie, and the Wolf” sequence, which would be followed by their breakfast, leading to the Prologue and Epilogue. We follow them to the Marcellus bar scene of the first story, where Vincent and Butch meet; we would follow Vincent to Mia and their night out, then end with Butch and the gold watch, with Vinnie’s death and Butch’s escape. Yes, it would work, but it certainly would not be as effective as it is now.

			It is the transitions between these stories that really hold it all together; they make the screenplay work, bridging both linear time and narrative line. All the characters are introduced and set up from the beginning, and these characters are the links that connect the three stories, even though they are told in a nonlinear way. The “wackiness” of the characters (their discussions and the dialogue are wonderful), along with the bizarre humor of the stories, makes Pulp Fiction the entertaining and highly influential film it is and, I think, will continue to be.

			Different kinds of films require different kinds of transitions. An action or action-adventure film like Apollo 13 or Mission: Impossible (David Koepp and Robert Towne), requires swift transitions, sharp, dynamic bridges that keep the pace flowing fast and smooth, so the reader and viewer are swept into a torrent of movement. Look at Twister, simply a one-line story of storm chasers; it is the four storm sequences that really hold the film together. So everything in the story acts as a transition leading into the next storm.

			A character piece, like Pulp Fiction or The Bridges of Madison County, requires a different kind of transitional connection, a smooth and careful sculpting of transitions. In a comedy the transitions from one scene to the next might be capped with one-liners, but they must be character driven or humor driven in order to move the story forward in a funny and seamless way.

			Transitions in a biographical or historical screenplay present a problem of selectivity. How do you weave what might be a number of historical incidents into a 120-page screenplay? If you simply string the character’s life story, or a series of events, in chronological order, it becomes nothing more than a filmed essay; first this happens, then that happens, then this other thing happens, and so on until the character dies or something significant takes place that leads to an ending we already know. As in Nixon, or Apollo 13, or Gandhi.

			Recently I had the opportunity of working with a Brazilian writer-director on a screenplay about the famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos. The writer did not want simply to show a biographical chronology of events, so he chose to write the screenplay like a free-association collage, fragmented bits and pieces of the composer’s life presented in a nonlinear fashion like some kind of visual jigsaw puzzle. That way, he explained to me, he hoped to make the composer’s life both visual and interesting. But, he confided, he felt very insecure about the script; he didn’t know whether it worked or not.

			When I first read the material I thought it an interesting presentation, but unfortunately, the script didn’t work; it was a hard and difficult read because I didn’t know what was going on; I didn’t know what the story was about and it was hard to get a grasp of the main character.

			My problem was “how to fix it,” how to keep the writer’s style and subject matter intact but also to tell the story of the composer, the subject of the script. At first I thought this was a structural problem, but when I went back over the material, trying to isolate and define the historical moments of the character’s life, I realized that the main character seemed to disappear off the page; that’s when I realized that it was really a problem of Character, because the events of his life seemed to overshadow him. The women in his life seemed to dominate him, the smaller characters seemed larger than he was, and there seemed to be too many events going on.

			When I took it apart, I saw the screenplay really focused on five major periods of the composer’s life, and it was these “parts” that were broken up and placed in various sections of the screenplay. I had the impression that the main character got lost on the page, for he literally disappeared from the action, even though it was his story and he was the main character. The main character always seemed to be reacting to the events of his life, and not creating them. The main character in a screenplay always has to be active; he or she must cause things to happen.

			A biographical film like Gandhi, for example, covers only a few events of his life, yet the conflict the character confronts and endures is encapsulated in two or three events and they become the structural foundation the script is built upon. The film covers only three major periods in Gandhi’s life: as a young attorney fighting for social causes; then formulating and embracing his philosophy and practice of “passive resistance”; then trying to mend the Hindu-Muslim disputes. Gandhi’s murder and death “bookend” the film, very much like the bookend Prologue and Epilogue in Pulp Fiction.

			The Brazilian script, as fragmented as it was, really dealt with these five periods of the composer’s life: his childhood, his struggles to get his music performed; the two women in his life; his world fame; and his final acceptance of old age.

			As I started going through the script again, I found that I could isolate and define these five areas of his life, but there seemed to be several key scenes missing, scenes needed to highlight and accent those periods of the composer’s life. And it was these key scenes, I felt—discovering the source of his inspiration, meeting his second wife, overcoming those incredible obstacles to get his music performed, and so on—which became the Plot Points, or anchors, the basic glue that held the script together.

			Good transitions in a screenplay should never really be noticed; they should disappear into the visual narrative like the individual threads that make up a piece of cloth.

			Transitions become an essential tool in the Problem-Solving process. If your script is too long, look for whole chunks of action, or full sequences, to omit and then find some kind of transition to tie the remainder together and bridge the action. Sometimes you can cover a longer period of time by using a montage.

			A montage is a sequence, a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end. The purpose of a montage is to cover a lot of time, or a lot of events, in a very short period of time. In the Brazilian screenplay we used several montages in order to move the story forward quickly. We numbered the shots: 1) walking along the beach; 2) at dinner alone; 3) working hard at the piano, sheet music spread all around him on the floor; 4) walking into an office; 5) in another office arguing violently with a short, fat bureaucrat, wearing different clothes from the previous shot; 6) walking angrily out of another building, on another day, wearing the same crumpled suit with a different tie, and so on. The montage served a very specific purpose within the screenplay, yet conceived as one single action carried out over a period of several days.

			Perhaps the best transition ever put on film was the marriage montage in Citizen Kane (Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz). The sequence starts after the marriage of Kane and his first wife, as they sit at the breakfast table having an intimate conversation. There is a swish pan (the camera swishes out the frame) and we see them in different clothes talking and reading the paper. Swish Pan and we see them at a slightly larger table having a very heated discussion. Swish Pan to them having a more vocal argument about him spending so much time at the office. Swish Pan to them at a much larger table, both silent, both reading the paper; she asks him something and he simply grunts a reply. Swish Pan to them at a very long table eating in total silence. It tells us so much in so little, using pictures instead of words. It’s an incredible sequence that is probably the best portrait of the disintegration of a marriage ever conceived.

			What Is Character?


			The problems of creating real people in real situations can be so varied and challenging that trying to define them is like trying to capture infinity in a glass. Generations of noted writers, from Aristotle to Ibsen, Eugene O’Neill to Arthur Miller, have struggled valiantly trying to articulate the art and the craft of creating good characters.

			It is difficult to capture a “true human being” on paper, and more difficult in screenwriting, because we’re dealing in pictures, not words. Great writers have always had this need to explain how they create character. One of the most profound literary theorists was Henry James, the great nineteenth-century American novelist. James was fascinated with the art and craft of writing, and approached it like a scientist, the same way his brother, William James, the famous psychologist, was occupied with the dynamics of the human mind. Henry James wrote several essays trying to document and capture the intricacies of creating character. In one of those essays mentioned earlier, James posed a literary question: “What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			It’s a profound statement.

			Does that mean the character determines the incident? Or the incident creates character? This is something that should be analyzed and understood, especially when dealing with character. If you’re trying to solve a problem relating to character, whether an action, reaction, or dialogue, it’s essential to understand the dynamics of Character. If you examine the Problem Sheet, most of the symptoms described could apply to any number of problems or situations found within the characters. Most of the problems listed deal with defining and articulating the actions and dimension of the character by relating to his thoughts, feelings, and emotions.

			Waldo Salt, the great screenwriter of Coming Home and Midnight Cowboy, among others, when asked about how he went about creating characters, replied that first he chose a simple dramatic need and then added on to it, and colored it until it became a universal chord common to Everyman.

			What is the dramatic need of your character? Do you know it? Can you articulate it? Can you trace it through the events of the story so it reflects a depth, and a change in the character? First of all, how do you determine whether you have a problem? Look at the Problem Sheet: do you feel your character is talking too much, or explaining too much about the story or characters? Do the characters sound the same? Do you think that you’re the main character? Does your character seem to disappear off the page? Do other characters seem to overshadow your main character? This is a common problem and applicable to all sorts of situations. Remember, there’s no one way to approach the problem of creating better character; there are many ways. The only rule you have to follow is whether it works or not.

			The first thing you need to do in solving a problem of Character is determining what the problem is. Identify it. Define it. As you read through the material looking for any telltale signs or symptoms, you have to trust yourself and your instincts; if you feel this little “tug” of discomfort, that’s usually an indicator that something is not working as well as it should.

			What’s the best way to approach solving the problem of Character? Start at the beginning; ask yourself the question What is Character?

			That’s the question Henry James explored when he began his inquiries into the nature of character. In a screenplay the story always has to move forward, from beginning to end, whether in a linear or a nonlinear fashion. The way you drive your story forward is by focusing on the actions of the character. As mentioned before, every scene in a screenplay should fulfill one of two functions: Either it moves the story forward, or it reveals information about the character.

			So what is Character? Action is character; what a person does is who he is, not necessarily what he says. Film is behavior. Because we’re telling a story in pictures, we must show how the character acts and reacts to the incidents and events that he or she must confront and overcome. If you read your script again through the eyes of your character, and you begin to sense and feel that your characters are not as sharp or defined as you think they ought to be, and you want to make them stronger, more dimensional, and universal, the first thing you must determine is whether they’re an active force in the screenplay; do they cause things to happen, or do things happen to them? It’s one of the more prevalent problems of Character.

			Take another look at the Problem Sheet; you’ll see several symptoms common to main characters who seem to react to the events of the story. It’s so important to remember that when you’re writing the screenplay, the main character must always cause things to happen; not that she doesn’t react to incidents or events some of the time, but if she is always reacting to events, she becomes passive, weak, and that’s when she seems to disappear off the page. Lesser characters appear more interesting than the main character, and seem to have more life and flamboyance.

			James’s observation that character is determined by incident and that the incident determines character is really at the heart of the writing of screenplays, especially now, in the nineties. Just take a look at the films being done in Hollywood today; at this point in time there’s a trend called the “event movie,” in which the character or characters are placed in extraordinary situations, and then we see how they react. In this scenario the word story may be a little too generous. Most of these characters seem to be just an idea of character, and the incident, or event—the special effects, actually—have become the star attraction. Look at Twister, Speed, Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park; the art and technology of computer generated images (CGI) is expanding so rapidly that the studios are actively seeking projects in which the event, or the incident, becomes greater than the story or characters. Subjects like volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, firestorms, or any other kind of natural disaster have become the star vehicles for “event” filmmakers. As the science progresses in moviemaking, the story lines, the subject matter, will adapt themselves to the times. Water rises to its own level.

			Character is character. When executed properly, James’s comment is an epiphany; just look at Thelma & Louise. The script sets up these two people by showing who they are. Louise, unmarried, a waitress, has a boyfriend, Jimmy, a musician, who’s playing a gig on the road and hasn’t called her once in three weeks. She’s pissed, and resolves that she’s not going to be home when he returns. So she decides to go to a friend’s cabin in the mountains without telling him where she is. When he does arrive home, she just won’t be there. That’s the back story.

			Thelma, on the other hand, appears to be a “ditzy” housewife; her kitchen is a mess, and her “breakfast,” a little nibble from a frozen candy bar, which she puts back in the freezer only to whip it out for another bite, reveals an aspect of character; we see who she is by what she does, her actions.

			Her husband, Darryl, an arrogant, egotistical fool, is a high-school hero whose best years are behind him. He treats her with so little respect that she has to lie to him just so she can go away for the weekend with her friend. “You get what you settle for,” Louise remarks to her on the road.

			Her personality is revealed by the way she packs her suitcase. She’s going away for the weekend, and this will be the first time she’s been away from her husband, but she doesn’t know what she needs to take with her, so she takes everything. In contrast Louise only takes two each of the things she needs. Film is behavior.

			Act I sets up their relationship, so when they pull into the parking lot of the Silver Bullet, the “dramatic hook,” we get to learn more about their relationship with the men in their lives. By the time Harlan tries to rape Thelma, their characters have already been established. When Louise interferes, Harlan tells her to “suck my dick,” and Louise totally loses it; she pulls the trigger, kills Harlan, and in that one second their lives and destiny have changed. Plot Point I. It is this incident, of being two fugitives on the run, that will alter and define their character. The impulse to pull that trigger came out of an experience in Louise’s past. This past event and how it affects present time will be covered in more depth in Chapter 13.

			That change is what the whole script is about; it is the incident that really determines their character. Their flight to Mexico becomes a journey of self-discovery that eventually leads to their death; and this awareness of only a few choices left reveals that they have nothing in their “past life” to go back to; they have burned their bridges and have literally “run out of world,” as screenwriter Callie Khouri says. Their destiny has been determined by their actions, and those actions have revealed who they really are. It is a journey of self-discovery. They now understand there is no way back. You can’t step into the same river twice.

			“What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			What is the particular incident or event that triggers the action of your screenplay? Once you know this key incident, then you can measure and evaluate how your character acts or reacts. In Twister the situation is set up in a back story situation where the two main characters (Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton) have filed for divorce, and when the script opens the papers are ready to be signed. The little opening sequence, in which a family races to the storm cellar to outrun a twister, shows us the dramatic need of the Helen Hunt character. Because she has lost her father to a twister, she has grown up and become a noted storm chaser. The Bill Paxton character wants to be free so he can marry his girlfriend, Melissa (Jami Gertz), and get on with his life and become a TV weatherman. From that point there really is no story; it’s simply the storm chasers racing after the four twisters that becomes the subject and structure of the screenplay. These four encounters are the glue that holds everything together.

			So what kind of problem do you see with your character? Is he or she too talky, too passive, or does the dialogue all sound the same, or do the other characters stand out more? Find out what it is. Locate and define it on the Problem Sheet. Can you define what you think the problem is? Imagine how it would look to you if the problem were already solved. Are your relationships clear, the emotional dynamics planted, and the character’s arc charted? It doesn’t matter whether you’re writing an action, thriller, love story, or comedy. Character is character.

			What makes good character? Four things: dramatic need, point of view, attitude, and change. In order to really solve the problems of Character, it’s essential to go back into your character and rebuild the foundations of his or her life.

			What is your character’s dramatic need? That is, what does your main character(s) want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay? Can you define it? Articulate it?

			The dramatic need is what drives your character through the story line. In most cases you can express the dramatic need in a sentence or two. The dramatic need of Twister, for example, is to find a way to release all those little weather balls into the heart of the twister. In Thelma & Louise the dramatic need is to escape safely to Mexico, and that’s what drives the two characters. Or, in Apollo 13 the dramatic need is to return the astronauts safely to earth.

			But it didn’t start out that way. When the story began, the dramatic need was to walk on the moon, and that changed when the oxygen tank blew. The dramatic question then became not whether they were going to land on the moon, but whether they’d be able to survive and return to earth safely.

			Many times the dramatic need will change during the course of the story. If your character’s dramatic need does change, it will usually occur at Plot Point I, which is, as mentioned, the true beginning of your story. Louise killing Harlan at Plot Point I forces the action in a new direction; instead of spending a weekend in the mountains, Thelma and Louise have become fugitives from the law. They must escape safely. Or, in Dances With Wolves, John Dunbar’s dramatic need is to go to the farthermost point of the frontier. But when he finally reaches Fort Sedgewick, Plot Point I, his dramatic need is now to learn how to adapt to the land and create a relationship with the Sioux.

			What about your character’s point of view—the way he or she views the world? This is usually a belief system, and as the psychologists say, “What we believe to be true, is true.”

			There’s an ancient Hindu scripture titled the Yoga Vāsistha, which states that “the World is as you see it.” That means what’s inside your head—your thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories—are reflected outside, in your everyday experience. It is our mind, how we see the world, that determines our experience. Inside and outside are the same. So how does your character view the world? Is there some kind of moral code, a sense of right or wrong, that determines his or her actions? “I believe in God” is a point of view. So is “I don’t believe in God.” And so is “I don’t know whether there’s a God or not.” All three positions are true. You can express a character’s point of view through his or her behavior, or through dialogue; for example, being a vegetarian is a point of view, because your character might believe that “I would never eat something that was killed for me.” It doesn’t mean it’s right or wrong, it’s just the person’s belief system. You can show it, say it, or have another character say it, it doesn’t really matter; but you, as writer, have to know it.

			Point of view creates conflict. The entire screenplay of Crimson Tide is constructed around the way two people see the world. In the story a group of Russian rebels have taken over the missile base and a U.S. submarine, the Alabama, carrying live nuclear warheads, is sent out to either launch a war, with a “first strike,” or to retaliate against any Russian missiles that may possibly be sent. The captain, the Gene Hackman character, believes that “war is an extension of politics,” and it is his duty to carry out his orders even if it means a nuclear holocaust. The Denzel Washington character, on the other hand, the executive officer, believes that because of nuclear weapons, war has become out of date, an outmoded concept. The purpose of war is to win, and if both sides launch nuclear weapons, there will be no “winner,” only losers. War is no longer a viable option.

			That’s when the Alabama receives emergency orders to launch a first-strike nuclear attack against the Russian rebels. As they are preparing to launch the weapons, they receive another emergency message that is cut off before the entire text can be transmitted. What do the orders say? Should they continue to follow the first orders and launch first strike? Or do they delay the launch to confirm or deny the first order?

			These two differing points of view, these two belief systems, generate the conflict that drives the script forward. That’s classic Henry James. Both points of view are right within the framework of character. There is no right and wrong, good or bad. Hegel, the great German philosopher, maintained that the essence of tragedy derives not from one character being “right” and the other “wrong,” or the conflict of good against evil, but from both characters being right, and the story becoming one of “right against right” carried to its logical conclusion.

			Both characters in Crimson Tide operate from that sense of truth within themselves. The captain maintains that the situation demands he follow the first orders received. The XO does not agree and claims the second order, even though not completely received, overrides the first and must be confirmed before they can launch their first-strike missiles. Nobody’s right or wrong in this conflict because their actions are determined by their point of view, the way they see the world.

			As I’m fond of repeating, all drama is conflict; without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story, and without story, you have no screenplay.

			It’s as simple as that.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, after almost twenty years in the Shawshank Prison, Red has acquired a cynical point of view because, through his eyes, hope is simply a four-letter word. His spirit has been so crushed by the prison system that he declares to Andy, “Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It’s got no place here. Better get used to the idea.” And it is his emotional journey that leads to him to the right understanding, which is that “hope is a good thing,” as Andy tells him.

			Andy, of course, has a different point of view; he believes that “there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there’s a small place inside of us they can never lock away. Hope.” And that’s what keeps Andy going in prison, that’s what made him sacrifice a week of his life in “the hole,” just so he could hear the two opera singers singing an aria from Mozart.

			Here’s the way it’s written in the script:

			 				INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE—AFTERNOON



			 				Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly conducting the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men.



			 				RED (VO)

				I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin’ about. Truth is, I don’t want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were singin’ about something so beautiful, it can’t be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away…and for the briefest of moments…every last man at Shawshank felt free.



			That’s what drove Andy to play the aria. For that “briefest of moments” he was free and showed us the force and power of the human spirit. It’s a beautiful scene.

			The third thing that makes good character is Attitude. Attitude is defined as a “manner or opinion,” and is usually an intellectual pose or decision. Being “macho” is really an attitude. I’m tough, see, I’m better than you are, it’s all attitude; it’s what Dennis Rodman is all about. He’s made a career out of attitude and it far surpasses his basketball prowess. Have you ever gone into a store to buy something and found yourself dealing with a person who does not want to be there at all, or a person who looks down on you? Have you ever walked into a fancy restaurant not wearing the “right” clothes? It’s that kind of judgment where someone is convinced “they’re right” and “you’re wrong”; judgments, opinions, evaluations, all stem from attitude. Understanding your character’s attitude is allowing him to reach out and touch his humanity.

			The Truth About Cats and Dogs (Audrey Wells) is a delightful romantic comedy that is entirely based on the character’s attitude. Abby, the character played by Janeane Garofalo, is a woman who lives by her opinion, her attitude; the decision she’s made is that all men really want in a woman is a pretty face and a great body. This attitude governs her behavior through the entire film. And Nora, the Uma Thurman character, just takes it for granted that she’s not very bright. You know, the “dumb blond” with the heart of gold. Marilyn Monroe is a legend because of her attitude expressed through the parts she played. Both Abby and Nora have to learn that their attitude is “not who they really are.” Their journey through the film is to accept themselves for who they really are.

			An attitude, as differentiated from point of view, can be right or wrong, good or bad, positive or negative, angry or happy, cynical or naive, superior or inferior, liberal or conservative. Do you know anybody who “thinks they’re better than everyone else”? Or people who feel the world owes them a living; or “it’s really who you know” that determines your success factor in this world.

			Sometimes it’s difficult to separate the point of view from the attitude. Many of my students struggle to define these two qualities, but I tell them it really doesn’t matter; when you’re creating the basic core of the character, you’re taking one large ball of wax and in this case, pulling it into four separate pieces. The parts and the whole, right? Who cares whether one part is the point of view and another the attitude? It doesn’t make any difference; the parts and the whole, as mentioned, are really the same thing. So, if you’re unsure about whether a particular character trait is a point of view or an attitude, don’t worry about it. Just separate the concepts in your own mind.

			The fourth element that makes up good character is change. Does your character change during the course of the screenplay? If so, what is the change? Can you define it? Articulate it? Can you trace the emotional arc of the character from the beginning to the end? In The Truth About Cats and Dogs all three characters undergo a change that brings about a new awareness of who they really are. Abby’s final acceptance that Brian really loves her for who she is completes the character arc of change.

			In The Shawshank Redemption Andy endured prison life only until he learned that it could be proven someone else had committed the murder of his wife and her lover. Only when the warden refuses to help him get a new trial and Tommy, the witness, is killed does he refuse to serve any longer. When he entered the prison he considered himself guilty, even though he hadn’t pulled the trigger, but now he has served “his time” and realizes the moment has come for him to escape. As we learn later, he has been preparing this for years.

			Having a character change during the course of the screenplay is not a requirement if it doesn’t fit your story. But since change is a universal constant of life, if you can impel a change within your character, it creates an arc of behavior and adds another dimension to the material.

			These ingredients are what make up the foundation of good character; if you know these four elements, dramatic need, point of view, attitude, and change, you can approach any problem that deals with character.

			The Circle of Being


			There are times during the screenwriter’s journey when the story works well, with a tense and dramatic plot, and all the characters seem to have interesting backgrounds, but there’s a nagging sense that the dialogue is thin, maybe “tinny,” filled with clichés, and doesn’t seem to go anywhere. Something seems not to be working, and you really can’t put your finger on what it is; maybe you’ve had the script read by a few friends or associates, and they tell you they “like it.” When you press them further, more often than not they point to the dialogue and say it may need polishing.

			You hear this quite a bit in Hollywood, especially among development executives, and when they encounter this problem their solution is to bring in another writer to rewrite the dialogue. Writing is rewriting, and sometimes as many as twelve writers are brought in to “hone and polish” the project.

			Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. The Rock is a case in point. The original screenplay, written by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook, was a really strong screenplay in terms of plot and character, it was just the dialogue that seemed to be flat and one-dimensional and didn’t seem to be working as well as it could. It had an exciting premise, good characters, interesting backgrounds, and pretty obviously had the potential to be a good “thump-and-pump” movie. Another writer, Mark Rosner, was brought in to rewrite the material. He did a draft and that is what attracted the director, Michael Bay. But when Bay came on the project he thought the dialogue needed more of a “spin,” so he brought in Jonathan Hensleigh to make it more contemporary and bring it up to date.

			Hensleigh worked hand in hand with the director for months, honing and polishing the dialogue, and was on the set every day just in case he was needed. When the film was completed the credits were established, and then the screenplay went to the arbitration panel at the Writers Guild of America. The panel consists of three screenwriters, independent of each other, who read the screenplay from the inception to the final draft. Each writer’s contribution is measured and analyzed. In some cases the arbitration panel will read fifteen different drafts of the screenplay, contrasting and comparing each one with the final product. Then they’ll award the screenwriting credits based on how they see each writer’s contribution. In the case of The Rock it was determined that the original writers should get the screen credit, and not Jonathan Hensleigh.

			That decision sparked a real debate within the creative community. The director was outraged, as were a number of other people in Hollywood. He insisted that Hensleigh receive a credit, and rightfully so. Didn’t rewriting the dialogue warrant a screen credit?

			Yes and no.

			The Writers Guild of America, the WGA, has determined that a screenwriter can only receive a screenwriting credit if he or she has rewritten fifty percent or more of the screenplay. So when a new writer is brought in he or she, in most cases, will alter the structure, add new locations, create new scenes and characters, while trying to keep, hopefully, the idea of the screenplay that was originally purchased by the studio or production company.

			What’s the point of all this? Dialogue is a function of character. It’s true that some writers have a better ear for writing dialogue than others; they’re just born with a natural talent and ability, and it’s really a gift. But if you know your character well enough, if you feel comfortable inside his or her skin, the dialogue will be individual and appropriate and capture the “essence” of that character. The dialogue may not be that great, but it’ll still work. The function of dialogue, remember, is simple; dialogue either moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. You can say things, explain things, or show things in order to reveal character.

			If you look at the Problem Sheet, most of the symptoms listed there deal with dialogue. After all, dialogue is one of the most striking qualities about your character. It tells us who he or she is, sets up the exposition, moves the story forward, adds humor, and can be one of the elements used in transitions. If you think your dialogue is too thin, or your characters all sound alike, or if you explain too much, the best way to solve the problem is to go back to the beginning and rethink your character.

			One of the ways to accomplish this is by doing an exercise I call the “Circle of Being.” It’s a process, really, a process that allows you uncover some kind of an incident or event in your character’s life that emotionally parallels and impacts the story line; it’s an event that happens to your main character when he or she is between the ages of ten and sixteen. This is an age period where some kind of traumatic event could conceivably occur that would affect the entire course of your character’s life. It might be the death of a parent, or of a loved one; it could be physical abuse that results in a deep emotional scar; it could be a physical event or injury, or quite possibly a move to a new city or country.

			Thelma & Louise is a very good example. As Louise was growing up in Texas she was raped and discovered she was unable to get justice. It was this incident that “formed” her behavior and ultimately led to the incident that powers the entire story line, the shooting of the rapist Harlan in the parking lot. It explains why she pulled the trigger in the first place, and why she wouldn’t set one foot inside the state of Texas.

			If you think about it, the Circle of Being is a valuable exercise, or a tool, that you can use in crafting, enriching, and enhancing your character. If you go into your character’s life and ask yourself what traumatic incident might have occurred to him or her between the ages of ten and sixteen, see what happens.

			Why ten and sixteen? Because it happens to be a very important age in a person’s life. The noted behaviorist Joseph Chilton Pierce states that there are four major growths, or spurts, of human intelligence in our lives. The first occurs when the child is about a year old, when he or she learns to walk. The second spurt occurs about age four, when the child learns that he or she has an identity, as a boy or a girl, and has a given name; when the four-year-old acts, there is a response, and at that age he/she belongs to a family, and these are his/her parents and he/her lives in this house in this city. At this age, the child is able to communicate his or her needs.

			The third stage, or spurt, in the growth of human intelligence occurs when the child is about nine or ten; that’s the age when he or she understands that he has a definite personality, a singular and individual voice. The young person is learning to question authority, forming his or her own opinions, and starting “speaking his mind.” This is a very vital time in the life of the child.

			The fourth stage in the growth of human intelligence, and the most important developmental spurt, according to Pierce, occurs when the person is about fifteen or sixteen. The teenager. That’s the age when the teenager rebels against everything and tries to find his/her own voice, suddenly understands that his parents are no longer the center of the universe, and looks outward into the world for role models, seeking forms of behavior, like clothes or hair, that are acceptable to his peers and express who they are. They have an identity. Just look at your own kids, or your brother’s or sister’s kids or your friends’ kids, and look at how they dress, how they act and react, what kind of music they’re listening to, their slang and manner of speaking. It’s a period of life that is so influential in a person’s life that it will form a subconscious identity, or impression, for the rest of their life, much as furniture leaves impressions in the rug. Take a moment to see how strong this impression is in your own life; close your eyes and go back to that time when you were about fifteen or sixteen, and see what incident or event affected you the most. What was the incident or event that springs to mind? If you want, play some music from that time and see what memories it brings up, and then take a moment to see how some particular incident from that period has affected you and possibly changed your life.

			The Circle of Being is a wonderful tool that lets you dig into the emotional substance and dimension of your character. Just look how it affected Louise; when Callie Khouri wrote the screenplay, she did not refer to the incident at all except to state that Louise had no intention whatsoever of stepping one foot inside Texas, no matter what the reason. But the director, Ridley Scott, thought the audience should know about this event and how it triggered Louise’s actions, so he had Khouri make a few references to the incident; Hal, the Harvey Keitel character, even told her, “I know what happened in Texas,” and Thelma guesses that “it happened to you, didn’t it?” referring to the rape attempt. To the very end Louise never responds to this.

			This incident is the reason for Louise to stubbornly insist that they’re not going to cross the Texas state line. Because the only way to get to Mexico without going through Texas is to go through Oklahoma, the decision ultimately costs them their lives. This Circle-of-Being incident is relived in the parking lot when she sees Harlan attempting to rape Thelma, and she totally loses it.

			Thelma & Louise is an extraordinary film, but many writers I’ve talked to didn’t like it for this very reason; they say Louise “overreacted” by shooting Harlan, and could not “willingly suspend their disbelief” enough to get into the story after that. But I think they didn’t get that it was really the sixteen- or eighteen-year-old rape victim Louise who pulled that trigger, not Louise in present time.

			If you can go back into your character’s life and create an incident or event that becomes an influence or a force working on your character, you can enhance the texture of any character you’re writing. By creating the Circle of Being you can generate a plot complication that will expand the depth and dimension of your character and literally drive the story forward. In Twister the Circle-of-Being incident is shown in the opening sequence, when Helen Hunt’s father is swept out of the storm cellar; it is the incident that motivates her to become a “storm chaser.”

			One of my students, a well-known and working playwright, wanted to make the switch from writing for the stage to writing for the screen. He had an interesting story that involved the reconciliation of two sisters after an absence of many years. The story opens when the main character, who happens to be a dentist, accidentally injures her teeth, and to correct the problem she must undergo a dental procedure. While she’s under the influence of the anesthesia she flashes back to the time when she was a young girl and witnessed her sister being raped by their uncle. Fearful of being seen, she runs away and in her flight trips over a rock, falls, and hits her front teeth, the same teeth that are acting up now. She had totally repressed the memory of this incident and it leads her to pursue a reconciliation with her sister. It was the Circle-of-Being event that sparked the entire story. By forcing herself to confront and deal with this incident that took place in her past, she begins to look at her life and sees that she must mend her relationship with her sister. It’s a powerful moment during the screenplay, and I suggested to the writer that we see visual bits and pieces of this incident throughout the story as it unfolds, so he began to weave and incorporate this visual memory throughout the body of the screenplay. It turned out to be very powerful material.

			I call this process the Circle of Being because if you picture your character as a circle and then section him/her off, as you would divide a piece of pie, you section off the physical, emotional, mental, and intellectual incidents or events that make up the fabric of your character. In this way you can create a well-rounded portrait of your character, and then everything you do—all the emotions, thoughts, and feelings you dramatize—works to expand your characterization.

			One of the most powerful examples of the Circle of Being and the way it can be used is the incident that powers the action in Arthur Miller’s play Death of a Salesman. Now, even though it’s a play, and is explained through dialogue, it is this Circle of Being that makes the character of Willy Loman so powerful. The story, about an aging salesman forced to come to grips with the loss of his dream, is a masterpiece and one of the greatest American plays of our time.

			Sometimes, depending on your story line, you might want to verbally express the Circle-of-Being incident, but in other stories, like Thelma & Louise, it’s stronger because it’s not explained. You, as writer, don’t necessarily have to explain it, but—and it’s a very big but—you have to know it. Because if you don’t know it, who does?

			In this particular scene from Death of a Salesman, Willy Loman has come to see his “boss”—actually, the son of the man he worked for over thirty-four years—with his dreams and the American dream shattered to pieces. Now, with the last vestige of his dignity, he has come to ask the son of his boss if he can give up the road, literally his way of life, and work at the main office. Willy Loman is a salesman, and he doesn’t know anything else.

			Willy is asking Howard, the son, for a job on the floor, and first he asks for $65 a week, then drops his request to $50 a week, and then, in his final humiliation, he is literally forced to beg for $40 a week. But this “is a business, kid, and everybody’s gotta pull his own weight,” and Willy Loman’s sales figures have not been the best lately. Willy responds by retreating into his memory and tells Howard what drew him to become a salesman: “When I was a boy—eighteen, nineteen,” he says, “—I was already on the road. And there was a question in my mind as to whether selling had a future for me….”

			He pauses for a long moment, then continues on. [That’s when] “I met a salesman in the Parker House. His name was Dave Singleman. And he was eighty-four years old, and he’d drummed merchandise in thirty-one states. And old Dave, he’d go up to his room, y’ understand, put on his green velvet slippers—I’ll never forget—and pick up his phone and call the buyers, and without ever leaving his room, at the age of eighty-four, he made his living. And when I saw that, I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want. ’Cause what could be more satisfying than to be able to go, at the age of eighty-four, into twenty or thirty different cities, and pick up a phone, and be remembered and loved and helped by so many different people? Do you know when he died—and by the way he died the death of a salesman, in his green velvet slippers in the smoker of the New York, New Haven and Hartford, going into Boston—hundreds of salesmen and buyers were at his funeral.”

			That’s Willy Loman’s dream; that’s what drives him to get up every morning and hit the road, and when that dries up, the dream is dead and life is not worth living. That’s the Circle-of-Being experience in Willy’s life. Remember Andy Dufresne’s line in The Shawshank Redemption. “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” But if the dream collides with reality, as in the case of Willy Loman, and all hope is lost, then what’s left? The death of a salesman.

			That’s the force and the power of the Circle of Being. Once you’ve created an experience or an incident that affects the life of your character, then you can base the emotional arc on that incident and have the character confront and resolve (or not resolve) the experience. It becomes a way of embellishing the depth and dimension of character, to create a strong and defined point of view and attitude, and contains within it the spark of conflict.

			Recently, I was commissioned to oversee the writing of a screenplay about a Native American warrior from the Oneida Nation, one of the six member nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, called the “Longhouse,” and their divided loyalties between the American colonists and the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War. The main character is forced, literally against his will, into a situation where he has to align himself with the colonists in their war against the British. The immediate result, which is historically accurate, was a situation in which brother fought against brother, family against family; the ultimate result, unfortunately, was the confiscation of the Indian lands, the entire Northeastern part of the U.S., by the American government. It’s a story of divided loyalties, a story of fate and destiny, and based on a historical incident.

			But the facts of this warrior’s life were thin, almost nonexistent. What was known was that he sided with the colonists, but why he did so was never answered, and that was a question that had to be answered dramatically.

			This was the situation: It is well known historically that the Iroquois Confederacy wanted to remain neutral in this conflict; the elders declared that a war of this kind, a war of rebellion, was like an argument between a father and son. And anyone who takes sides in this kind of conflict becomes party to a no-win situation. If the Confederacy sided with the British, in this case the father, and the son was defeated and lay broken and bleeding on the battlefield, the father would hate the people who had done it. On the other hand, if the Confederacy sided with the son, the colonists, and the father was vanquished and suffering in defeat, the Indian nations would alienate all their British friends. So the best thing to do, they decided, was to stay neutral.

			So that’s what they did. Until the British army, bearing gifts of rum and trinkets, persuaded a prominent member of the Mohawk nation to join them. He then convinced several of his brothers to side with the British. And, when the British army started their march toward Albany, they were aided by these Mohawk warriors. In their first battle they attacked a colonial fort where the Oneida women and children, their cousins, had taken refuge. Historically, that’s correct. Again, would that action alone make the Oneida warrior align himself with the colonists?

			Not necessarily so. My partner in this project didn’t really know how to solve this particular situation, so I suggested that she create a Circle of Being for the character. I told her to start from the character’s life and the known historical facts. The warrior was born the son of an Oneida woman and a German settler. So what event might have happened to the main character during his youth, say, around the age of fifteen?

			If you look at the significance of the Circle of Being, it can be a defining incident that embraces all those internal, external, emotional, physical, and background forces working on the character’s life. What kind of incident would make the warrior turn against his own friends and relatives? There are many answers to this question, of course, but one particular solution (a created, dramatic incident) worked very well; when the warrior was a young man, say about fifteen, he watched his father die at the hands of some drunken British soldiers, and then they burned their meager crops and the houses they were living in. Contrived? Yes, but historically, it was not all that uncommon for an incident like this to happen, especially at that time. In dramatic terms it worked very well, and it’s an incident that really doesn’t have to be explained during the screenplay, as long as the writer knows it. In this case the Circle-of-Being incident is referred to only once, and all the emotional choices and decisions the character makes follow from that significant event.

			Some films use the Circle of Being as the basis of the entire story line, and it becomes the subject of the film. I was at a prerelease screening of a film entitled Loved (written and directed by Erin Dignam), starring Robin Wright and William Hurt. It’s the story of a young woman who had been entangled in a mentally and physically abusive relationship some six years before the story began. She was sixteen then and it was her first “serious” relationship. She managed to extricate herself from her lover, but in the years following the relationship, the man became involved with two other women, and in one of these relationships the woman suffered a broken leg and hip at the man’s hands. In the other relationship, in the scene that opens the film, the man and woman are in a heavy discussion next to a crowded highway. The man turns and walks away, and the woman races directly into the path of a speeding car and is killed. The DA’s office wants to bring a charge of manslaughter against the man, and to fortify their case they want the Robin Wright character to testify, so a preliminary hearing is held. During the time she is on the stand, she has to relive the relationship, confront it, and deal with it; in the end she accepts her share of responsibility for the abuse she suffered and frees herself from it, and the last scene shows her ready to resume her life and hopefully enter into a more positive and loving relationship. Sometimes a bad or abusive relationship is better than none at all. From the character’s perspective the physical abuse she received from this man demonstrated how much he loved her.

			It’s a good illustration of how the Circle of Being generates an entire screenplay. If you take a look at the problems described on the Problem Sheet, many of them can be directly solved by creating a strong Circle-of-Being incident for the main character.

			In The Silence of the Lambs the Circle of Being plays a prominent role in generating the transformation of the character Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster. The Silence of the Lambs is the story of a young FBI trainee tracking down a serial killer, but before she can accomplish that she must come to grips with an incident that occurred in her own life when she was about ten years old. That incident was the death of her father, a small-town policeman killed during an attempted robbery. But if you dig deeper into this extraordinary script (from the extraordinary novel by Thomas Harris), you’ll find that this is really a story of Clarice’s relationship with “three fathers.” Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) is the director of the Behavioral Science Division at the FBI Academy, and gives her the break to interview Hannibal Lecter that directly leads to her becoming involved in hunting and capturing the serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is her mentor, guiding and teaching her what to look for when pursuing a serial killer. It is through their relationship and his relentless psychological prodding and insight that she is forced to confront the death of her father, something she had buried deep in her unconscious.

			It is a Circle-of-Being event. Because of her father’s death she was sent away to live with an uncle in Montana. One night she was awakened by the screaming of lambs being slaughtered. So she tried to rescue one of the baby lambs, but was caught and sent away to live in an orphanage. It is Hannibal Lecter’s forcing her to look at this emotional issue that ultimately frees her of it, and at the end of the film she can build a new life, both in a committed relationship as well as in her job as a top-notch FBI agent. But only when she can confront this incident of the past, the Circle of Being, can she be free. It’s exactly the same with Louise in Thelma & Louise, except Louise never gave up holding on to the rape and it literally cost her her life. But Clarice, under the tutelage of Lecter, was strong enough to be able to surrender to it, deal with it, and let it go.

			The Silence of the Lambs ends with Clarice receiving her diploma, and at the reception following her graduation she receives a phone call from Hannibal Lecter asking “if the lambs have stopped screaming….” And then he shares his “admiration” for her by telling her that “I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.” He is the first to acknowledge Clarice’s transformation from the trainee with an incomplete childhood into a trained professional, ready to fly.

			So if you feel that your character is too thin and one-dimensional, too passive or too reactive, or speaks in dialogue that is too direct or explanatory, one way to solve the problem is to go back and explore his or her life in terms of the Circle of Being.

			Dull, Thin, and Boring


			How often have you read something you’ve written and, much to your chagrin, found that the writing seems to be flat, the characters thin and one-dimensional, and as much as you want to deny it, or as much as you defend it, you cannot escape the cold, hard fact that everything you’ve written seems to be dull, thin, and boring? When you think about all the time and effort you’ve spent and all the sacrifice and denial you’ve had to endure, to end up with pages like this—oh, Lord!

			Believe it or not, this is a pretty common refrain among screenwriters. And of course, as little as you want to admit it, it’s true most of the time; the writing is dull, is thin, and is boring. Once you’ve recovered from the shock of your discovery, then you can rack your brains trying to figure out what you can do to make it work, or make it better; you might think about adding some action scenes, or adding a subplot, or creating a new character, like a love interest, perhaps, simply to liven up the action.

			That’s one solution, and it may work in some screenplays, at least for a little while. So you decide to add some new scenes and a new character to liven up the action, but when you sit down to reread the material, you suddenly notice something else isn’t working and you get that sinking feeling in the gut that you really haven’t fixed the material, you’ve just put a Band-Aid over it. Given it a paint job.

			The real problem, the source of what makes the material dull, thin, and boring, persists. In despair, though hoping for the best, you have friends read it, but all they can tell you is that this or that needs to be strengthened, and when you try to fix this or that the material still doesn’t seem to work. You’re more confused than ever.

			What usually happens when you’re trapped in this scenario is that your confusion gives rise to frustration, which then funnels up into anger, then smothers you in a blanket of despair and depression, and the ultimate result is that you just give up. It’s all part of the writer’s journey.

			The problem is still there. What can you do about it?

			Let’s take it step by step. The first thing you need to do is simply stop writing, sit back, and try to gain some kind of objective overview of your screenplay. And just because you’re not writing does not mean you’re not writing; it just means you’re rethinking a creative problem. A script that’s “dull, thin, and boring” is best approached from the perspective of Character.

			In one of his literary essays Henry James suggested that the main character of a story occupies the center of a circle, and all the other characters surround him in an outer circle. James felt that each time the main character comes in contact with one of the other characters, some light or knowledge or insight should be revealed about the main character. And he used the image of someone entering a dark room and turning on the lamps in each corner, illuminating a specific part of the room.

			James called this the “Theory of Illumination.” It’s a wonderful tool to use when you want to expand the dimensions of the character. In Witness, for example, a young Amish boy witnesses the murder of an undercover policeman. John Book (Harrison Ford) attempts to have the boy identify the killer in a series of mug shots and lineups, but they are unsuccessful. So, for lunch, Book takes the boy and his mother for a hot dog. The scene opens with Book picking up the food and setting it on the table. Without looking at the boy and his mother, he heaps some mustard on the dog and takes a big bite. As he’s chewing, he notices that Rachel and her son are saying a short prayer over the food. Immediately, Book becomes embarrassed and self-conscious. With a silly little grin on his face he waits until they’ve finished their prayer before he finishes chewing.

			As they eat, she launches into a conversation about what Book’s sister (Patti LuPone) had told her about him; she told Rachel that “you [Book] should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you’re afraid of the responsibility.” “Oh,” Book replies. “Anything else?” “Oh, yes,” Rachel continues, getting into it. “She thinks you like policing because you think you’re right about everything. And you’re the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a…um…bag of elbows. Yes, I think that’s what she said.”

			It’s a wonderful little scene. In just a few lines (the scene is less than a page long), we literally know everything we need to know about John Book. Rachel sheds light on, and illuminates, what kind of person he really is. First, look at his name. It’s no accident—he is a policeman who “lives by the book.” He thinks he’s “right” about everything—this is his attitude—and he constantly complains about the policemen he works with. He’s unmarried, but he likes kids and “tries to be a father” to his sister’s children.

			This little scene reveals so much about Book’s character. What makes it work so well is that within the body of the scene they’re doing something, eating, putting mustard and ketchup on the dogs, not just sitting around talking. Even this little action of eating reveals the different points of view between these two characters. And two different points of view is the first step in generating a substantial source of conflict. In this case it represents a different way of life. As the boy and his mother bless their food, Book just wolfs it down, and so illuminates visually the difference between them.

			James’s Theory of Illumination is a good way to give your character a lot more richness and texture, which, in turn, makes him or her more interesting, full, not thin. In Witness the business of preparing the hot dogs for their meal gives the characters something do during their dialogue scene, which keeps the action moving. And it’s all written into the screenplay.

			There are many different ways to use the Theory of Illumination to reveal information about a character: you can have the main character reveal something about himself or herself to another character (do this only if you can’t find another way to reveal the information); or another character might say something about the main character, as in the Witness scene. Or maybe a voice-over narration would be appropriate, as in The Shawshank Redemption, or Dances With Wolves, or How to Make an American Quilt, but just make sure this narrative device is appropriate to your story. Don’t use a voice-over narration just once or twice during the screenplay, though, it’s true, in Apollo 13 it is used only once, at the very end of the script when Jim Lovell sums up the results of the mission. You can achieve the same purpose using some kind of subtitle, or crawl, or newspaper headlines. In Stand By Me (Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans), the script ends with the Richard Dreyfuss character sitting at the computer writing the story we’ve just seen; you might also use some kind of magazine headline or partial story text on a computer screen. Occasionally something about the main character may be revealed in a dream sequence or in a flashback, like Andy’s escape in The Shawshank Redemption, or maybe a flash forward (which is basically what Apollo 13 accomplished with the voice-over at the end).

			All of these various tools or devices are effective ways of illuminating some of the visual and emotional aspects of the main character. But you have to be consistent with whatever device you use, because the integrity of the screenplay must be maintained. That’s what makes Pulp Fiction work so well; the humor, along with the nonlinear structure, are woven throughout the film. All the characters are introduced in the beginning and then the three separate stories are played out in their entirety.

			Before you decide to use any of these various techniques, however, you must go back to the drawing board of your character. How do you do this? First, make an inventory about the relationships between your main character and the other characters in the story. Can you define these relationships clearly and succinctly? Are they deep enough, or interesting enough? In Independence Day (Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich) the Jeff Goldblum character is very thin in his portrayal; all we know about him is that he still wears his wedding ring even though he’s been divorced for three years. The only reason his wife left him, at least that we know of, is because she wanted to advance her career. What about their relationship? Was it working? Harmonious? What about children? What was their marriage like? Although this is back story, and not necessary to state in the body of the film, it’s imperative that the writer know this in order to achieve the full dimension of character. It’s pretty thin in the script; the only reason it works is because this is an “event” film, and, as in Twister and Mission: Impossible, the special effects are really the star; the main character only leads us to the effects. And while it works at the present time, you can’t count on its always being the “current trend” in Hollywood. Most of the time these “event” films are really dull, thin, and boring.

			Once you’ve examined the relationships of your main character, decide which ones need to be expanded, given more texture and dimension. One of the ways to do this is by writing a one- or two-page, free-association (automatic-writing) essay that redefines the relationship. In this exercise you want to recreate the relationship from the beginning. Where did these characters meet? How long ago? What kind of incidents or events can you create that will help define and clarify and strengthen their relationship?

			Creative research means you enter the world of the character in order to define and redefine their lives and relationships. The more you know about your characters and the events of their lives, the more options you have to choose from in order to make them visually interesting and exciting.

			Explore their first meeting. What were their thoughts and feelings about each other? What was it that made their friendship ripen or grow, or what was it that caused the relationship to turn sour? How long has this relationship endured? That could mean any relationship between man and woman, boyfriend, girlfriend, boss or associate; it could mean a rivalry on the tennis court or in the courtroom. In films like Seven we don’t actually know why the Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow characters left the place they were living and moved to the big city. We really don’t need to know, but you better bet that Andrew Kevin Walker, the screenwriter, knows. Their decision to leave the community they were living in and come to the city is what leads to the powerful conclusion of the film. So if you don’t know things about your characters, about the important decisions and events that happened in their lives, who does?

			If you feel the characters are talking too much, or the dialogue is too specific or too direct, or the characters are flat and one-dimensional, and the material is simply dull and boring, there are several ways to approach the problem.

			Let’s break it down into three distinct categories: What can you do if the screenplay seems Dull? Does the script plod along with excessive dialogue, or do the incidents and events take too long to develop, or are your descriptions too thick and dense, and do you have a hard time following the narrative line? All these are symptoms of dull writing. What can you do?

			First, change the style of your writing. Don’t try to write complete, literary sentences. Focus on short, descriptive passages, maybe one-word sentences, where the words are used to accentuate color and humor to the reader. Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight, among others) uses dynamic and imaginative writing in his work; for example, in a car-chase sequence with the cars squirreling through traffic and racing down sidewalks scattering pedestrians, the cars scrape each other; and the way he describes it is short, visual, and concise: “The cars trade paint.” It’s a great way to convey the thrill of the chase.

			If you’re writing more of a character piece, go back and redefine your characters by writing short two- or three-page essays dealing with the character relationships. Look for ways to strengthen your characters to make them more interesting. Go into their professional life, their personal life, and their private life, what they do when they’re alone. That means hobbies, gardening, exercise classes, raising pets. In Crimson Tide the little dog the Gene Hackman character takes everywhere adds to and expands the characterization.

			Then, of course, you have to look for conflict; to find ways of going deeper into the scenes in order to achieve maximum dramatic value (MDV) in your character relationships. That means possibly redefining your character’s point of view, the way he or she looks at the world. Conflict is one sure way to avoid dull writing, but you have to go into your character’s life in order to effectively portray this. Conflict, remember, can be internal, like an emotional problem, or external, a threatening force working on the characters, as that induced by the hunt for the aliens in ID4 or the storms in Twister. It’s up to you to design and integrate these conflicts into the story line.

			You might possibly want to change your character’s point of view. Look for the opposing points of view during your scenes; what are your characters thinking or feeling about the situation? When your character enters the scene, do you know where he or she has come from? What happened to him or her before the scene occurs? Do you know what the purpose or motivation of this character is in the scene? Does the scene reflect your character’s dramatic need? Look within the context of the scene for ways to generate conflict; do the characters have a different point of view in terms of what’s at stake in the scene? Is the problem external to them, like a physical or emotional threat? The film Seven is a good example of this. The tension between the serial killer, the Kevin Spacey character, and the Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman characters, is taut and tense because we don’t know what’s going to happen, though we know something must happen for the story to resolve itself. Remember, in good writing we discover what’s happening at the same time the character does. Reading a screenplay should always be an act of discovery. That’s why the ending of Seven is so memorable.

			What do you do if your material is too Thin?

			Add something to fill it out; either create another character so you can add more scenes, and give more detail to the character, or think about adding an action sequence, and if that’s not enough and you need to go deeper into the story line to give it more body and texture, you might think about adding a subplot (see Chapter 10).

			Before you can make any decisions about what to do, go back into each scene and check out the action point of where you entered it. Many times a writer will enter a scene too late and leave it too early, and that results in cutting away from the action before it’s fully realized. It dilutes the narrative line and is one of the causes of a script’s being too thin. If you go back into the basic construction of each one of your scenes, you can always structure it into beginning, middle, and end. Set up scenes beginning in the preceding scene if possible, then determine what’s going to happen in the middle of the scene, and finally the end of the scene, where you pay it off before you segue into your transition for the next scene. It might be a good exercise to list the components that make up the beginning of the scene, the elements that make up the middle of the scene, and what happens at the end; so, you have lists of actions for the beginning, middle, and end of the scene. Then you can take whatever elements you need and structure them into a new scene.

			Take a scene like Andy Dufresne’s entrance into Shawshank Prison. How many ways could you lay that out? Hundreds, and they’d all be good and visually effective. But if you look at the elements involved, you can go deeper, add things to fill out the material, and make it richer. In this case someone is arriving at the prison. So, you have the elements of the bus ride, the actual entrance into the facility, the checking in of the new inmates, and so on. But look what Frank Darabont did: first, he introduces Red, the Morgan Freeman character, with the parole board, then in voice-over narration he tells us about the first time he saw Andy Dufresne. Only then does he create this marvelous overview of the prison with the helicopter shot. (That shot, by the way, was created on location and is one of my favorite shots in the film.) Then he cuts to the bus to show the emotional fear and confusion of Andy sitting on the bus with the other cons. We see the tough prison guard Hadley, we see the screaming inmates howling, “Fish, fresh fish,” and we see the new cons filing off the bus in their chains, and how they look to the hardened inmates.

			All that material can be sorted out and structured into elements of the beginning, middle, and end. This doesn’t mean you have to show all the ingredients you’ve laid out, just that you have to be selective as to whether to use them or not. Frank Darabont chose to use most of this introduction to Shawshank, but in isolated, fragmented bits and pieces of film. First, he cuts from the judge’s gavel striking the block to the sound of a door opening in prison (a sound-to-sound transition), then we meet Red being evaluated by the parole board (it’s really only half the scene, the beginning and middle), and then we see the stamp of rejection. We follow Red as he steps out into the prison yard and we get the magnitude of where we are:

			 				RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business. He’s an important man here.



			 				RED (VO)

				There’s a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I’m the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you’re partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid’s high-school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason.



			 				He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.



			 				RED (VO)

				Yes, sir, I’m a regular Sears and Roebuck.



			 				TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing everybody’s attention to the loading dock. The outer gate swings open…revealing a gray prison bus outside.



			 				CON

				Fresh fish! Fresh fish today!



			 				Red is joined by Heywood, Skeet, Floyd, Jigger, Ernie, Snooze. Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.

				INT.—PRISON BUS—DUSK

				Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains.



			 				RED (VO)

				Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin’.



			 				The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates.

				Andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls.



			 				RED (VO)

				On the outside he’d been vice-president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then.



			This is a scene with texture, depth, and dimension, both in terms of visual presentation, as well as in utilizing the Theory of Illumination. The whole sequence (I’ve presented only the opening section) gives us the necessary information we need to know for the story to move forward. We’ve introduced the main characters, revealed information about them, and now watch as the story unfolds through the eyes of the main character. We see prison life from two points of view: from Red’s and from Andy’s.

			Look at the elements inherent in the scene: first, the prison and the cons; then Red and his group; then Andy arriving, then the welcome, hearing the rules of the prison, and seeing the way the cons create their own rules. These are the elements that become the foundation of the narrative line and are used to keep the story moving forward. It’s definitely not dull, it’s certainly not thin, and for sure not boring. It’s great screenwriting, a very good illustration of how to employ the various elements inherent in the fabric of the scene. If you read the novella by Stephen King, you’ll see how much Darabont had to add and adapt in order to mold and contour the story line into a dynamic cinematic presentation.

			Which brings us to Boring. What if you’re reading your script and your eyes hurt, your attention wanders, and it’s hard to understand what’s going on, it’s hard to sit still, and you have to fight off the urge to get up to find something to eat, and reluctantly you have to admit to yourself that you’re bored to tears? Your worst fears seem to have come true. How do you deal with that?

			First, some practical pointers. Nothing turns a reader off more than having to read thick and dense single-line paragraphs that fill up half to three quarters of a page. To support the reader, make sure your descriptive paragraphs are not longer than four or five sentences. If you’ve laced your script with long descriptive paragraphs, break them up into shorter paragraphs. Make sure the descriptive prose is not too “thick,” or “dense”; a good screenplay should have a lot of white space on the page. You don’t have to cut the material, just break it up into new paragraphs every four or five sentences. So many times a screenwriter will write a thick descriptive paragraph that fills up most of the page and it just stops the reading process cold. Lean, clean, and tight. That’s what you want in your screenplay.

			What else can you do to remove the element of “boring”?

			Check your writing style. You want to write in an active, present-tense style, so make your descriptive sentences shorter, tighter. Check the dialogue; is it too wordy, too long, and too explanatory? Cut it down. Be ruthless. Either dialogue moves the story forward or it reveals character. If it doesn’t satisfy these two requirements, cut it.

			After you’ve done this, see if there are places in the text where you can add some kind of action, either a car chase or a kiss; just know that whatever action you choose has to fit within the fabric of your story line. Obviously, you can’t add something without reason, or something that doesn’t fit, or something that’s completely out of context. If you check your material carefully you might find a few places where an action sequence, or some humor, might help to relieve the heaviness or density of the reading experience.

			After you’ve made that assessment, move into individual scenes. Are there places where your characters are just talking heads, sitting in a restaurant, driving a car, or walking through a park? What are they doing during the scene? What’s happening around them? For example, if they’re sitting in a restaurant having an intense conversation, give them something to do. Let them be eating shrimp, for example, or corn on the cob, or let a tooth chip or break; or let the character be coming down with a cold; try to add something to the detail of the scene that the characters have to deal with. If your characters are driving in a car, let another driver cut them off and maybe the driver overreacts, so you’ve now got two things going on at the same time; the conversation as well as the reaction to the other driver. This adds depth and tension to the action.

			In The Shawshank Redemption, when Andy Dufresne has locked himself in the warden’s office and is playing the operatic aria, the guards and warden are banging on the door. Two different things are going on simultaneously. So look for ways to incorporate any kind of secondary action into your scenes.

			When Andy makes contact with Red for the first time, Red is playing catch with a baseball and this action continues through the entire scene. Give your characters something to do during the scene. You don’t have to explain anything, just show it.

			There will be times when a dialogue scene isn’t working. No matter what you do, or how many times you change the character’s lines, the scene just doesn’t seem to gel. If this is the case, there are a few things you can do: number one, go into the scene and clarify its elements. Define the purpose of the scene. What is the dramatic need of the main character? What does he or she want during the scene; what is he or she doing there? Where did the character come from before the scene began? Where is he or she going after the scene is over? You don’t have to write this information into the scene, or explain it, but you, the writer, must know it. Don’t assume anything; clarify and define the character’s dramatic need until there’s no question in your mind about what happened before the scene began and what’s going to happen after it’s over.

			If the scene or sequence still isn’t working, there’s something else you can do: switch the lines of the characters. If Bill’s the main character and he’s in the scene with his ex-girlfriend, Sally, and he wants something from her, some information, or a package, whatever, simply switch the lines. Give Bill’s lines to Sally and Sally’s lines to Bill and see what happens. If that doesn’t work, rewrite the scene and change the character’s point of view. If Bill is the main character, and Sally is a major or minor character, write the scene from Sally’s point of view and let Bill be the secondary character. That means you have to enter the scene from Sally’s point of view and see the purpose of the scene through her eyes.

			This is an amazing little exercise. It removes any resistance you might have to the scene, and somehow dissolves the blocks that keep it from working. Once you’ve written the scene this way, go back and rewrite it from Bill’s point of view. See what happens.

			These little things can literally change the tone and texture of the screenplay. They can add depth and dimension to the scenes so the reading experience does not end up being dull, thin, and boring.

			The Passive Active


			There are times during the screenwriting process when the main character seems to vanish, literally disappears off the page. No matter what the character does, either in terms of fulfilling the story’s action or in revealing information about himself/herself, the personality, the behavior, or the dramatic need vanishes and the character is lost within the matrix of the action. And then, at other times, a minor character suddenly emerges, developing such a strong and vibrant personality that he or she totally overshadows the main character.

			I call this phenomenon the passive active. It’s where the main character seems to wander around looking for something to do, and, no matter what he or she does do, always reacts instead of acts, and is portrayed as passive instead of active.

			It can be a real problem, especially if your story line is built around this particular character and he/she gets lost in the narrative story line or seems to disappear off the page. One of the best ways of becoming aware of this problem is to evaluate the material and determine whether the main character is reacting to the situation or is actively creating it.

			You’re writing for the visual medium. One of the strongest rules governing the craft is that your main character must be active, and be the catalyst of the action, the spark that causes things to happen. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t let your character(s) react to a particular situation during the screenplay, just the opposite. Characters are always reacting to events or forces that affect them.

			In Three Days of the Condor (Lorenzo Semple and David Rayfiel), the Robert Redford character is literally “out to lunch” when the entire cell of his CIA unit (they read books looking for information) is wiped out. When he discovers this, he understands it won’t be too long before the assassin comes after him, and he enters the Second Act not knowing what to do or whom to trust. For the entire First Half of Act II the Redford character is only reacting. It is only at the Mid-Point, about sixty pages in, that he kidnaps the Faye Dunaway character and begins to be active again. And it works perfectly. If you haven’t seen it in a while, check it out.

			Action and reaction are two sides of the same coin. As a matter of fact, Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that “for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” It’s just something to be aware of, and it can be a good rule to follow. If something happens to a character, if he or she is affected by an incident or event, the reaction is a normal part of character revelation. It only becomes a problem when the character is reacting constantly, not only to an incident or event, but also to other characters. Things always seem to happen to him/her; the character doesn’t cause or trigger them. If you show your characters reacting too much of the time, they’ll simply disappear off the page or, as sometimes happens, disappear off the movie screen.

			A few nights ago I was watching television, and a Steven Seagal movie, On Deadly Ground, came on. I started watching. This was a film that Seagal starred in as well as directed. The film opens with some beautiful location shots of the Alaskan wilderness, and we cut to an oil well fire that’s burning out of control. A helicopter wings its way over the rugged country, bringing the Seagal character to the fire. He lands, gets out, and approaches the team of firefighters. They can’t handle it and they don’t know what to do. So what does the Seagal character do? With only a few words he dons his fire suit and walks directly into the raging inferno. He stands there, surrounded by flames, casually plants some explosives, then just as casually walks out. The other characters scatter, looking for cover, but the Seagal character simply stands there as the oil well explodes, putting out the fire.

			Pretty strong stuff, right? Strong action, a strong character, and some powerful visual images. What I saw during the thirty or forty minutes I watched the film was that it was a perfect example of the passive active. Why? Because the portrayal of characters was so thin, the film became laughable. Michael Caine, the fine English actor, played the mean and totally corrupt oil baron, but his performance (I’m sure it was written as it was played) was a one-dimensional, histrionic, over-the-top characterization of a man obsessed with carrying out his evil scheme.

			Opposing him, of course, was the good guy, Seagal. The portrait of the Seagal character is the perfect expression of the passive active. As the main character he’s the strong, silent type, a man who doesn’t talk too much, a man who wants to avoid trouble, except when pushed too far, and only then will he react and take action—and as we see, he’s a character who can literally do everything. Whether it’s putting out the oil fire single-handed, or being a master of martial arts, or breaking into a computer and uncovering secret passwords, or protecting the rights of a drunken and downtrodden Eskimo. He is a man who is reacting to the situations caused by others, the bad guys. And all this is shown in the first fifteen minutes, by the way!

			The unscrupulous oil baron, the bad guy, and the Seagal character, the good guy, quickly square off and it’s pretty predictable who’s going to come out on top.

			It’s easy to see what Seagal and the writer were striving for here; they wanted to portray the Seagal character as the strong, silent type, but because we’re not privy to what he is thinking or feeling, he comes across as a character who only reacts to the events instigated by the Michael Caine character. That makes him a reactive character. Throughout the film the main character does not once instigate any actions, he only responds to actions initiated by someone else; so all we know about him is that he’s reacting to what’s happening to him and how it affects the tribal community of Eskimos.

			His character, portrayed as the strong and silent type, is a man who seemingly knows everything, is right about everything, and lives according to a strict moral code that came out of the early westerns of Tom Mix. He was so busy being the “good guy,” and reacting to the things the bad guys have done, that he becomes a boring character and literally disappears off the screen.

			For example, here’s a situation that is supposed to reveal an aspect of his character. It’s a typical bar fight, and it could have been taken right out of a Tom Mix western. Seagal’s sitting in the bar, drinking alone at a table. Three big tough guys, oil riggers, are hassling a drunken Eskimo who wants another drink. They taunt him, then begin pushing and shoving him around until he collapses into a corner. Seagal doesn’t do anything, he simply stares at them. When they belligerently ask what he’s looking at, Seagal at first does not reply. When they continue taunting him, he stands and the oil rig workers exchange words with him. Seagal walks toward them and, before they can continue talking, launches into them, throwing them all over the place, and in only a matter of minutes he reduces the oil workers, and there must be at least ten of them, into whimpering weaklings, begging and groveling for mercy.

			Ho-hum. It’s pretty standard fare. We’ve seen it hundreds of times, for it’s a predictable bar fight: the hero sits alone minding his own business when some tough guys pick on someone who can’t take care of himself, usually a drunk, and the hero steps in and rescues him. What makes this interesting for our purposes is that the Seagal character is so passive, portraying an attitude rather than any emotion. And that’s the way he is during the entire film. We don’t know anything about him, and all we see about this character is a strong, silent, passive attitude. He becomes the passive active. It’s not very interesting.

			The screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader interested enough to keep turning pages, or in this case, keep my fingers off the remote. The real lesson to be learned in this case is that at no time do we know enough about Seagal to see or understand his thoughts, feelings, or emotions; all he reflects is his attitude. His humanity, or believability, is all contained inside his head.

			That being the case, the only thing this kind of a character can do is react to the situation. By placing a character in these types of situations, reacting to something someone else has initiated, the screenwriter causes his main character literally to vanish, to disappear off the page.

			In many of Robert Redford’s films he portrays this type of active/reactive character. Take a look at Sneakers (Larry Lasker and Walter Parkes), Indecent Proposal (Amy Holden Jones), or Out of Africa (Kurt Luedtke). In Sneakers he plays a character who doesn’t show any thoughts or feelings, he simply states that he has a plan and then we see him implementing the plan and then he seems to disappear into the background. He is a passive yet active character.

			So if you’re writing, or rewriting, a screenplay, and you sense that your character is washed out, or unseen on the page, or he or she is overshadowed by another character, or the story line seems contrived or predictable, or conflict seems to be missing, the chances are your character is too passive and is busy reacting to other characters or situations rather than creating or initiating the action.

			One of the “rules” of screenwriting is that action is character. It must be remembered that film is behavior, and what a person does, his or her actions, reveals who he or she is. But there has to be a way for the reader to connect with the character; there must be a character-audience bond established for the script to be effective. If this bond is not formed, then there’s a whole dimension missing in the illumination of character. And when that’s the case, there is no “willing suspension of disbelief.”

			How do you go about solving the problem of the passive character? First, it has to be approached from the perspective of Character. A lot of writers try to solve the problem by approaching it through Structure; they seem to feel that if they can add enough action sequences, or tense dramatic moments, that will take care of the problem. All that does, however, is accentuate the passivity of the main character. Just like On Deadly Ground. It’s not enough to pile on a number of action sequences, because it doesn’t really solve the problem.

			So, how do you recognize the problem of the passive/active?

			Take a look at the Problem Sheet, and see if you can recognize some of the symptoms. When you reread your material, does your main character seem be lost in the background of the action? Do you find that one of the minor characters seems to leap off the page and draw attention away from the main character? Do your characters all sound alike, as if there is only one voice for all? What about conflict? Is there enough? Is your character’s point of view clearly established and defined? Do you find your dialogue dull and boring? Or maybe your main character is constantly explaining things, and the story moves forward through dialogue rather than action? Are your scenes focused, or flat and one-dimensional, with no color and texture?

			All of these symptoms could be indicative of the problem of a character who’s too passive.

			So what do you do? There are many ways to solve this kind of problem, but perhaps the easiest is to examine the character from the perspective of conflict. Do you know the character’s point of view? Have you gone into the background of the main character and established a strong Circle of Being? What about the point of view within each scene? And what about your character’s dramatic need? Is it clearly defined in your own mind? If not, go back and redefine your character’s dramatic need and point of view in relation to the conflict of the story line. Go through and extract the elements of each scene and make sure you’ve got enough conflict, either on an emotional level in terms of the scene’s subtext, i.e., what’s not said during the scene; or on the level of direct confrontation or even physical conflict. Don’t make things too easy for your character. If things happen too easily, the action becomes contrived and predictable.

			Which brings up another point. Sometimes the screenwriter, wanting to avoid being too direct, or too “on target,” in the dialogue, tries to be a little too subtle, a little too indirect. That creates a sense of confusion and a lack of understanding, so the needs of the character become lost in what the character is not saying. The dialogue seems vague and off center and the reader really doesn’t know what’s going on, and the story line seems to wander off in several directions. It’s a symptom of the screenwriter’s wanting to be too clever.

			There are times in a screenplay when the dialogue has to be direct, for exposition purposes, in order to move the story forward, whether on a physical or an emotional level. And sometimes these scenes are the hardest to write just because they are so direct and on the mark. They’re so easy, you think there’s something wrong. This is where you don’t need subtlety of action or dialogue, you need clarity and definition to keep your character active and interesting. The great American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald always felt that the hardest thing a writer has to do is to “write down” to his readers; what he meant by that was that it’s very hard to write material that is too specific and too direct, with no subtlety either in thought, action, or exposition.

			This happens all the time if you “try” to make your character alive and interesting. If you think you’re really being smart and clever writing “indirect” dialogue, there’s a good chance the motivation and need of your character will simply wash out and disappear off the page, lost in the twilight zone between clarity and confusion.

			That’s when another character will start to take over and become more interesting than the main character. If you get the feeling a minor character is dominating or overshadowing the main character, and is more lively and more interesting, it’s a pretty good indication the main character might be too passive, and you’re going to have to strengthen the characterization. It should be noted that there will be moments when your main character will be reacting to another character, action, or situation, and that’s not bad—it’s when reaction becomes his or her only response that it proves a detriment, and that’s why you have to be careful walking the line between action and reaction.

			A case in point is The Accidental Tourist. Adapted from the novel by Ann Tyler by screenwriter/director Lawrence Kasdan and Frank Galati, the film, starring William Hurt and Geena Davis, is a quirky comedy about a man who has recently lost his son in a senseless shooting in a mall. William Hurt portrays a writer of travel books for people who detest traveling, and by nature he’s a character who is withdrawn and reclusive. His only companion is his dog, who, it is understood, loves to travel. They’re quite a pair together. And when the Hurt character accepts a new assignment, he takes his dog to be boarded in a kennel and there meets the delightful and wacky Geena Davis character. And she makes it her “mission” (her dramatic need) to bring him out of his shell because she’s looking to find a father for her own son.

			The novel is so unique that it poses major problems adapting it into a screenplay. In the first place you have a main character who’s divorced, alone, and reclusive, and the fact that he’s just lost his son in a senseless killing simply compounds the problem; his main action is moping around feeling sorry for himself. This is very delicate material that works wonderfully on the printed page under the gifted talent of Ann Tyler. But translating this kind of material to the screen is very difficult. If you want to visually portray a character reacting to the death of another person, you have to know from the beginning that the character’s gaze will be mostly focused inward, that he will be self-absorbed in grief and somewhat reluctant to engage in any kind of action, physical or emotional. This depends on the story of course, but in the case of The Accidental Tourist it’s a primary force that’s working on the character.

			The Hurt character is obsessed with the injustice of life, and withdraws into a comfortable routine of inaction and noninvolvement. This can work part of the time, but since we’re trying to take a passive character and make him active, we have to find a way of incorporating some kind of emotional reaction and making it more visually active. Sometimes, in this situation, you can simply slide over the grief and get the character back on his feet by throwing him into a new situation. For example, one of my students was writing a script, a thriller, and the film opens up with a lovely anniversary dinner between a husband and wife. When the evening’s over, they decide to exchange cars for the drive home. So the wife drives home in the husband’s car, but as she’s driving, the windows, doors, and sunroof suddenly seal shut, poison gas is released, and she’s killed.

			The man’s dramatic need is to pursue and find the killer(s) of his wife and bring them to justice. But he never really accepts the mourning process, so he is constantly moving through the action devoid of any emotional reaction or grief. You could say that he’s in shock and total denial, and that may be so, but he becomes so obsessed with justice and revenge that he literally becomes a passive character in the midst of nonstop visual action.

			This is totally opposite the passive-active character portrayed by William Hurt in The Accidental Tourist. So it really doesn’t matter what kind of story you’re telling, whether an action, adventure, drama, or comedy. That the Hurt character is a writer makes him even more difficult to portray visually. And it just didn’t work. What happened in the film is exactly what happened in the screenplay: the main character Hurt portrays literally disappears off the page. Oh, yes, he’s there physically, but there’s no connection with the audience, and no sympathy for him whatsoever. Which, of course, is part of his character.

			The Geena Davis character, on the other hand, is striking in her “activity.” She’s always in motion, and livens up the page, and the screen, by her presence, delightfully active in her quest to bring the Hurt character back into life again.

			But it isn’t enough.

			The passivity of the Hurt character drags the whole film down. It was an attempt to make a passive character work on the screen, and it didn’t work; it was, as they say in Hollywood, an “interesting failure.”

			On the other hand you have a character like Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (Andrew Davis), who is constantly reacting to a particular situation; in this case he’s wanted for the murder of his wife, and is on the run, trying to elude capture by the law in the form of the Tommy Lee Jones character. His dramatic need, to prove his innocence and find out who actually committed the crime, is what drives him through the screenplay. It’s the engine that keeps the story moving forward. So even though he’s continually reacting, he’s an active character because he causes things to happen, he’s always doing something to try and prove his innocence. And he’s not adverse to helping a little child who’s been misdiagnosed, by going back into the hospital and making a notation on the chart. The little side journey reveals his character through his behavior. Film, as I am so fond of saying, is behavior.

			Even if you have a character confined in a physical location does not mean that he or she has to be passive. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (Ted Tally) is a good case in point. Locked inside a prison cell, he is far from being passive. Through insight and perception he prods, probes, and finally provokes Clarice Starling to confront and deal with her past, for two reasons: One, of course, is that he is tutoring her to bring the serial killer Buffalo Bill to justice, and by doing that he can achieve his dramatic need, which is to be moved to another prison facility where he can be placed in a cell with a window. His motivation, and the way he manipulates Clarice, even though he’s locked inside a small six-by-eight-foot cell, is honed to achieve his dramatic need; everything else is secondary. So, he manipulates her to serve his own purpose. That’s makes him an active character even though he’s locked in a passive location.

			When I was working with the Brazilian filmmaker on the screenplay about the famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos, he was very nervous giving me the screenplay to read, he confided, because it was such an unconventional story line. It was a nonlinear screenplay told in a series of flashbacks that traced five different threads of the composer’s life: his boyhood; his search for musical inspiration and direction; his relationships with the two significant women in his life; his life of celebrity and worldwide recognition; and lastly, his final concert and death.

			He thought the problems in the screenplay were structural; but what I discovered was that structure wasn’t really the problem; the main character, the composer, was the problem. Because of the nature of the script, the composer was always reacting to the forces that were shaping his life. That made him a passive character, not an active one. It made the screenplay a simple biography, not a visual experience of the man’s life. That kind of story simply doesn’t work well. No matter that the five different story threads were structured in a jigsaw-puzzle fashion; it didn’t change anything. Throughout the screenplay the main character was constantly reacting to other people, and this created a kind of visual landscape that forced him into the background, and made the secondary characters stronger and more dynamic.

			Once I identified the problem, we could approach it from the vantage point of Character and not Structure, even though it touched both. So we went back to the foundation of the screenplay in order to make the composer more active. The composer had to create the action that would cause other people to react. And this had to be set up from the very beginning, so we had to restructure the entire First Act, adding several new scenes in which the composer created the action, and the other characters reacted. Even though this was an unconventional script, it was not difficult to find a way to solve this particular problem once we identified it.

			Another way to make the character more active is to go back into your scenes and redefine the dramatic need, both in terms of overall story and in the context of each individual scene. If you determine the point of view of each character in each scene, then it’s possible to rewrite the scene adding conflict to achieve the maximum dramatic value. Part of the reason a character seems to be passive and reactive is because there’s a lack of conflict. Nine times out of ten if you feel your character is too passive, or is reacting too much to an external situation or character, it’s due to a lack of conflict. So go back and redefine the internal and external forces working on the character.

			If it’s an internal, emotional reaction to a situation or event, try to create a visual metaphor and let us see it. For example, in Dances With Wolves after the John Dunbar character arrives at the fort at Plot Point I, the first thing he does is give himself the task of cleaning up the area; his behavior tells us that he’s cleaning up his life and putting things back in order.

			If you find it too difficult, then write a new character biography that will create a new Circle of Being, and in this way you can establish a strong and perceptive point of view that will generate more conflict.

			That’s the essence of transforming a character from passive to active.

			The Flash Point


			What’s the best way to use a flashback? When does it work the best and when is it the most effective?

			These are some of the most common questions I encounter regarding the flashback; it really doesn’t matter what country I’m in, or whether the writers are students or professionals. For some reason, the use of flashbacks in a screenplay seems to elicit indecision and insecurity. So, when I’m asked what’s the best way to use a flashback, I listen patiently, then ask why the screenwriter wants to use one in the first place. The person usually becomes very serious and states that the flashback gives information that’s essential to the story.

			That’s cool, I respond, but if you use the flashback in this particular situation, does it move the story forward? Or, does it reveal something about the character? Remember, the flashback is simply a tool, a device, which the screenwriter uses to provide the reader with information that he or she cannot incorporate into the screenplay any other way. That’s something most writers don’t understand or take into consideration. That’s why there seems to be so much confusion about whether to use a flashback or not.

			The purpose of the flashback is simple: it is a device that bridges time and place either to reveal information about the main character, or to move the story forward.

			When flashbacks are done well and integrated into the narrative line of the story, as in How to Make an American Quilt, The Usual Suspects (Chris McQuarrie), Courage Under Fire (Patrick Duncan), The Long Kiss Goodnight (Shane Black), Lone Star (John Sayles), The English Patient (Anthony Minghella), or are absorbed into the Third Act as in The Shawshank Redemption, the flashback works wonderfully. But when a flashback is thrown into the screenplay because the writer doesn’t know how to move the story forward any other way, or decides to show something about the main character that could be better stated in dialogue, then the flashback only draws attention to itself and becomes intrusive. That’s when it doesn’t work.

			The flashback is a tool; it should be used to give the viewer information about the character or story that he can’t get any other way. It can reveal emotional as well as physical information (as with Andy Dufresne’s breakout from Shawshank), though it often does both, and can show different points of view of the same event, as in The Usual Suspects or Courage Under Fire. Or it can reveal thoughts, memories, or dreams, as in The English Patient or Shine (Jan Sardi).

			That’s when the flashback is most effective. If it is incorrectly used, as the Problem Sheet reveals, it only highlights flaws: characters who are too thin and weak, action too subtle or episodic, and the story itself seeming to wander around searching for itself, like a dog chasing its tail.

			I firmly believe that flashbacks are an aspect of Character, not story. As a matter of fact, I tell my students that a flashback is really a “flashpresent,” because what we’re really seeing is what the character is thinking and feeling in present time, whether a memory, an event, or fantasy, or the illumination of the character’s point of view. What we see in a flashback is shown through the eyes of the character, so we’re seeing what he or she is seeing, thinking, or feeling in present time; in this time and in this place. No matter what it is. Take a look at The English Patient again, or Shine, or Lone Star; the action all takes place in present time with the character remembering moments in time past. The “flashpresent” is anything the character is thinking and feeling in the present moment, whether a thought, a dream, a memory, or a hope, a fear, or fantasy, for time has no restraints or limits. In the character’s head the “flashpresent” could be past, present, or future.

			In Courage Under Fire, for example, the same incident is seen through the eyes of different characters, and each one views it differently. The subject of the script is honor; it dramatizes how a person must learn to live with a mistake he made that resulted in the death of a friend. Not only that, but the Denzel Washington character is forced to lie to the dead man’s family at the urging of the military. The context of the film, what holds it together, the circumstances or situation, is the Gulf War. Each particular flashback reveals what happened when a medic helicopter on a rescue mission was shot down by Iraqi soldiers.

			What happened when the helicopter went down? That’s the assignment of the officer in charge, Colonel Serling, played by Denzel Washington. The pilot who flew the mission is being considered for the Medal of Honor, America’s highest and most prestigious military award. But it turns out there are some discrepancies in the survivors’ stories, and to add further fuel to the fire, the captain of the medic helicopter is a woman, played by Meg Ryan. Colonel Serling is told by the White House that it is important politically for her to receive the medal, for it will be the first time a woman would have been so honored for courage under fire.

			The script begins with an incident in the Gulf War that takes place at night, in the heat of battle. Colonel Serling makes a decision to fire at a tank that does not respond to his message. Only after the tank is destroyed, and all men lost, does he learn the tank was one of his own, captained by his friend. That’s the inciting incident of the screenplay, the incident or event that catapults the story into motion. When he returns to the States, he’s given the assignment of investigating the woman’s actions, and is forced to look into the mirror of his own soul to examine his own actions under fire, which he cannot forgive or forget.

			So we explore the subject of “courage under fire.” As he’s investigating the actions of the Meg Ryan character, he forces himself to seek out the truth, while under constant pressure from the White House and the military. He finds that for each step he takes, his actions are reflected back at him through his own experience.

			But it’s the perfect setup for using the flashback. This is the kind of story I call an “emotional detective story,” for each member of the surviving crew sees the action differently. It’s a Rashomon-type story, and it’s up to the Denzel Washington character to sort things out and find “the truth.” His search becomes a journey of transformation and self-forgiveness.

			It’s true there are two different stories in this screenplay, but both stories reflect the emotional scar that remains unhealed in Colonel Serling’s heart, and his dramatic need is to resolve the conflict within himself.

			Two other examples that use the flashback effectively are The Long Kiss Goodnight (Shane Black) and The Usual Suspects. The Long Kiss Goodnight is the story of an amnesia victim (Geena Davis) who has a memory of only “three thousand days,” eight years by her count. Her name is Samantha, Sam for short, and she has no memory of her past life other than being washed up on the beach in a T-shirt and jeans. Since that time she has married a nice man, Hal, and has a wonderful eight-year-old daughter, and continuously wonders about her past. As she says in her voice-over in the opening scenes, when she woke up, her daughter was “two months grown in my belly. I don’t know who put her there. I may never. I just know she’s mine, and she’s about to turn eight.”

			When the script opens, it is near Christmas Eve and as she’s driving her father-in-law home, she inadvertently hits a deer that kills her father-in-law, and she lands in the hospital. But something’s wrong, something she can’t explain, and she feels the need for a cigarette, even though she doesn’t smoke. As she lights up, she sees herself in the hospital mirror and suddenly her reflection becomes alive, drenched in blood, and the reflection says her real name is Charly and she smokes Marlboro Reds. This starts a series of quick-cut flashbacks where she learns more about her identity.

			Things start heating up on Christmas Eve when a group of carolers are singing carols in front of the house. Only something’s wrong; the carolers are singing horribly off key. And when Sam throws open the door to welcome them and offer some Christmas cheer to them, no one is there except a trained killer pointing a shotgun at her. And he calls her Charly. And she reacts, yanking the gun out of his hand, leading to a wild and woolly fight sequence where we learn (as she learns) that she definitely has the ability to take care of herself. She ends up killing him, brutally, shocking herself as much as her family. Plot Point I. She’s really incredible at what she does and she’s astonished that somewhere within her memory banks is this amazing killing machine. It frightens her and she begins her journey of self-discovery to recover her lost life.

			It’s easy to see how the script is an ideal vehicle for the flashback. Every time Sam finds herself in a certain situation, the screenwriter draws upon a wonderful tool to show us some of the incidents and events of her past life. And it’s not until the Mid-Point that she fully steps into her identity as Charly, and learns (at the same time we learn) that she was an assassin for the CIA. And they want her dead because she “knows too much.”

			She is truly a lethal weapon—so lethal, in fact, that she wonders, as we do, how she could have lived so contentedly as a wife and mother with this killing machine inside her. And this is what she’s trying to resolve.

			We’re not talking about the quality of writing here, or how good or bad the film is, we’re simply talking about creating the cinematic context of taking a particular situation and effectively incorporating flashbacks into the material. All the flashbacks used are points of present time, the “flashpresent.”

			Which is illustrated very clearly in The Usual Suspects. What makes the screenplay so unique is that we’re examining one particular event, an explosion on board a ship in the San Pedro harbor that kills some twenty-seven men over a reported $91 million in cocaine. This event is seen through a series of voice-over flashbacks narrated by “Verbal” Kint (Kevin Spacey), a palsied con artist with a twisted foot and a penchant for talking. Verbal is one of two survivors of the blast (the other is an aged Hungarian gangster), and under the relentless questioning of the customs agent played by Chazz Palminteri, Verbal tells the story of “what happened.” The context of the script is tailored to become the perfect vehicle to show the events leading up to the shipboard blast, the inciting incident that opens the film.

			There is no linear story-line progression here, meaning we don’t go through the story from beginning to end, chronologically, but the flashbacks reveal what happened in visual bits and pieces.

			As Verbal is being questioned, he tells us, in voice-over, how the five suspects were picked up, placed in the same holding cell, and questioned about the hijacking of a truckload of gun parts. And as Verbal answers the policeman’s questions, we start fitting the individual pieces of the visual jigsaw puzzle together. These questions work as lead-ins to the individual flashback sequences and, again, should be thought of as a “flashpresent” because Verbal is literally making the story up as he goes along. It’s a bold cinematic demonstration of taking a singular incident, as in Courage Under Fire, and presenting it in a nonlinear fashion.

			Which brings us back to the question of when to use a flashback, and when not to, and how to solve a problem with it, either by incorporating it into the story line or by removing it.

			There are no “rules,” of course, about this; it really depends upon whether you’ve designed the flashback to be an integral part of the story, as in Courage Under Fire, The Usual Suspects, The Long Kiss Goodnight, How to Make an American Quilt, or The English Patient.

			If your screenplay was not conceived to incorporate flashbacks and still doesn’t seem to be working, see whether “the problem” exhibits some of the symptoms listed on the Problem Sheet. If the answer is yes, and you think a flashback may solve the problem, whatever it is, then the simple rule If you can say it, don’t show it, may apply.

			Now, I’m sure this sounds like a contradiction, because the object of a screenplay is to tell the story in pictures, not words. The dialogue only becomes an adjunct to the visual information that moves the story forward; either that, or it reveals information about the character. Suppose, for example, you want to show an event that has affected your character, and you decide to incorporate it into the script. So you go through the scene and find a place to lead into the flashback, which naturally results in your cutting away from the middle of the scene to insert the flashback. What happens? In the case of The English Patient it works wonderfully, because the patient is a mystery, and slowly we begin to learn who he is, and his affair with Katherine, but each time we cut away there is a natural and solid transition point. Plus, the entire love affair, though told in flashback, is really the structural foundation of the entire film. We learn what happened to the English patient at the same time Hana (Juliet Binoche) does. It works wonderfully.

			By the same token there’s also a good chance that you might destroy the integrity of the scene. And that, of course, is not the point of the flashback. If you cut away in the middle of a scene, it could also create another problem instead. Why?

			Take a look at The Silence of the Lambs. When Clarice Starling visits Hannibal Lecter in his makeshift prison cell after he’s been transferred to Memphis, she wants to obtain the name of the serial killer Buffalo Bill. And she knows that Lecter knows the identity of the killer. She wants that name, but they don’t have much time before she’ll be forced to leave. His reply is that “we don’t measure time in the same way, do we, Clarice?” and then he insists that she tell him more about her childhood after the death of her father. Knowing the guards will return any moment (which creates a tremendous tension in the scene), she proceeds to tell him that she was sent to live with her uncle in Montana. One night, she tells Lecter, she woke up hearing “screams,” and when she sneaks out of bed to investigate, she finds men slaughtering the spring lambs in the barn. Horrified, she tries to save one of the lambs, but can only carry it about a mile before she’s caught and returned to the ranch. Her uncle is furious, and, in retaliation he sends her away to an orphanage, and that’s where she spends the rest of her childhood growing up. It’s a powerful scene, and especially significant since the title of the book and screenplay was taken from it.

			The scene was originally conceived as a flashback with the dialogue in present time playing over the images of Clarice as a little girl. But when Jonathan Demme filmed it, he saw the emotional dynamic of the scene between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster was so intense that if he cut away to show the child discovering the slaughtering of the spring lambs, he would absolutely destroy the integrity of the scene. As mentioned, this is one of the most important scenes in the film because it is the final flashback that shows her confronting the events of her past. Without completing this incident in her childhood, Clarice would have been incomplete in her growth, both as a person and FBI agent. Which is a major part of her character. On film the scene was so strong that the director couldn’t cut away and incorporate the flashback. The price would have been too high had he chosen to use it. He would have lost the emotional integrity of the scene. So he decided to keep the action in present time to maintain that. And, if you remember, the entire scene is played in close shot and it’s so powerful that it remains firmly fixed in the memory. The information revealed about the character was more revealing and more dramatic stated in dialogue than it would have been in flashback.

			This is not a hard-and-fast “rule,” but it is something to remember. So if you can say it, don’t show it.

			You can use flashbacks for any number of reasons but their primary purpose is to bridge time and place; to reveal a past emotional event or physical conflict that still affects the character, as in The English Patient; or to move the story forward, as in Courage Under Fire; and to give insight into, and understanding of, a character’s behavior, as in How to Make an American Quilt. Or to solve a mystery of the past, as in Lone Star.

			Using a “flashpresent” is also effective at showing memories, or visually giving expression to a thought or expectation or to wishful thinking; remember that scene in True Lies (James Cameron) where Arnold is driving in the Corvette with the salesman he thinks is having an affair with his wife and he busts him in the nose? Only wishful thinking. You can show that, no problem. You can also use the flashback to show how, or why, an event happened, or maybe flashforward to an event that may or may not happen in the near future. These all are ways to incorporate the “flash point” into your screenplay and make it work.

			In The Shawshank Redemption the flashback of how Andy Dufresne escaped from the prison at the end of Act II is a very good example of how and when to use the flashback. It’s important to remember that there are one or two things that are unresolved when you reach the Plot Point at the end of Act II. These must be resolved during Act III. In The Shawshank Redemption two things remain unresolved: one, how did Andy escape, and two, what happens to him and Red?

			The flashback that opens the Third Act is beautifully structured, and incorporates the flashback at this point as an integral part of the story. It’s what every flashback should do and be. “Get busy living or get busy dying,” Andy tells Red in the scene after Tommy is killed by the warden. The sequence opens with Andy waiting in his cell as the lights go out, and Red, in voice-over, tells us that “I’ve had some long nights in stir. Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade….” No one knows what Andy’s going to do. We watch as Andy gathers his belongings, pulls on the rope, and then we cut away to Red, waiting, wondering.

			The next morning Andy is missing from cell count. No one knows where or how he disappeared, and it drives the warden crazy. As the warden questions Red and the guards, he throws one of the rocks Andy left behind at the large poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. But a strange thing happens; the rock goes right through the paper. Everybody stops. The warden moves toward the poster, pokes his finger through the hole, then shoves his entire arm through. He yanks the poster off the wall and we discover (as the characters discover) that a tunnel has been hollowed out of the wall. We cut to a montage of several police cars racing down the highway, and guards combing the countryside, and all they find is part of Andy’s torn shirt and his loyal rock hammer, which has been worn down to the nub. That’s the flashpoint by which we lead into the flashback and Red tells us, in voice-over, how Andy got out of Shawshank Prison.

			We see a couple of scenes of Andy picking at the wall with his rock hammer to carve his name when a chunk of rock falls out; then we see him in the movie requesting the Rita Hayworth poster; then shots of Andy digging into the tunnel at night, and emptying the gravel from the tunnel into the prison yard. Then we flashback again and see Andy’s last night as he polishes the warden’s shoes, only this time we see it from Andy’s point of view; we see him substituting the false ledger for the warden’s, and he puts the false one into the safe. Then we see him walking back into the cell block, only this time we see the shoes he is wearing; bright and shiny. In Andy’s cell we see him taking off his prison garb, revealing the warden’s shirt and tie underneath, then he places his goods into the plastic bag and starts his escape to freedom. Red tells us in voice-over that “Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I can’t even imagine. Or maybe I just don’t want to. Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile.”

			This is just a wonderful flashback. Structured in a nonlinear way, it moves the story forward and reveals a part of his character that we never knew existed. Not once during the entire Second Act did he ever mention that he was considering escape. But if you think about it, that is his character’s dramatic need; to get out of prison must be the dramatic need of every convict doing time. We don’t need to state it, but the screenwriter must know it.

			Andy’s escape is a physical use of the flashback. It shows us how he escaped. But there’s also an emotional use of the flashback. In How to Make an American Quilt there are six different stories that deal with various aspects of love. The subject of the quilt, “Where Love Resides” is what the story is about. The screenplay itself is structured very much like a quilt; piece by piece, story by story, certain situations in life and love are shown that allow Finn to ferret out what she needs to learn so as to let go of her fear of commitment.

			What works so well is the lead-in point where the flashback dovetails into present time, and it’s this weaving of narrative story line between past and present that illuminates Finn’s dilemma so well. Each piece of the quilt the women are making gives us some insight and understanding into the nature of love.

			Using flashbacks in this manner offers a unique perspective on the action. Before she can deal with the commitment of marriage, Finn must learn to confront her own emotional fear. This is shown in two ways: one, through the dissertation she’s now working on (her third, she explains); we see her past history is constant as we learn, that when her thesis is almost complete, she decides that’s not the subject she really wants, and so begins another thesis on another subject. I think we’re all like Finn in a way, because most of us have struggled with the fears and insecurities of an emotional commitment at some point in our lives.

			The first thing we learn about Finn is that her fear of commitment has been passed down to her from her mother. “Maybe she was just afraid that their relationship had become just like everyone else’s,” she confides, and that’s why her parents separated. So, when Sam proposes to Finn, she, caught in this emotional turmoil, runs away to the safety of her grandmother’s house.

			As mentioned, each of the quilters’ particular stories reflects a certain emotional aspect in relationship to love and commitment. There is something Finn must learn from all the stories so she can resolve the conflict of “where love resides” within herself. This is a very good example of the way flashback reveals the emotional conflict that resides at the core of Finn’s character.

			Which brings us back to the basic question of this chapter: When can you use a flashback to solve a particular problem?

			The examples given illustrate the basic context of the flashback; either physical or emotional, it is the point at which you slide into the “flashpresent.” If you feel you have a problem the flashback creates or can solve, what do you perceive the problem to be? First, ask yourself what you want to use the flashback for. Is it to reveal character? Or is it to show how an event reveals the character, in terms of their actions and reactions? What incident are you going to show, and what does it reveal about the character, and how is it going to move the story forward?

			If, for example, you have a situation where you think your story is wandering around in circles, or your character is too talky and explains too many things, you might consider using a flashback to reveal a certain aspect of your character. If your character is too passive and reactive, or feels too thin or one-dimensional, you could use a flashback to provide more depth and dimension to your story line.

			But—and it’s a very big but—you just can’t insert a flashback because you think it will work to expand character. You need to go back into the character and define those forces that are working on him or her during the screenplay; if need be, write essays about the relationships between the characters just to clarify them in your own mind.

			“What is character but the determination of incident? And what is incident but the illumination of character?”

			These are questions you must ask yourself as you start contemplating the use of flashback to solve a particular problem. If you decide to use it, think of it in terms of a “flashpresent”; what is your character thinking or feeling in the present moment? If you can get into your character’s head, and find some thought, memory, or event that reflects, or acts, upon the present moment, and, through it, show how it affects your character, you gain an optimal advantage. Go into your character’s Circle of Being (Chapter 13) and see what you can find.

			The best use of the flashback is to provide some kind of emotional insight and understanding for your character. The transformation between Sam and Charly in The Long Kiss Goodnight is all about regaining a side of her character that’s been buried for the last eight years. That’s why I always think of a flashback as a “flashpresent.” It’s what’s inside your character’s head at the present moment; it either moves the story forward or reveals information about the main character.

			Could you have used a flashback in Thelma & Louise to show her Circle of Being? Possibly. There might have been an opportunity to show what happened to Louise when she was raped in Texas. It might have helped clarify why she killed Harlan in the parking lot. But would it have been as effective? Not really. There’s no sense spoon-feeding the reader or audience. We’ve become too sophisticated in terms of movie culture to do that. As far as I’m concerned, a flashback revealing this event in Louise’s life would have been redundant and surely not be as effective as the way Callie Khouri originally conceived it.

			So be careful when you use a flashback.

			Some films incorporate the flashback as a major part of the story; they use it to “bookend” their main story line, meaning they open the script with an incident or event, and then flashback to the actual story, then end it in present time again. A few films that do this well are: The Bridges of Madison County, Sunset Boulevard, Annie Hall, and Citizen Kane. And, of course, Pulp Fiction.

			Should you decide to use a flashback, make sure it doesn’t intrude upon the flow of the action, or get in the way of the story, or draw too much attention to itself.

			If you can say it, maybe you don’t have to show it after all.

			Sceneus Interruptus


			Structure is the foundation of screenwriting. The word itself means “to build, or put together,” so when you start structuring your script, you’re building and putting scenes, sequences, and acts together into a unified whole with a definite beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. Structure can be either linear or nonlinear, depending on the needs of your story.

			The second definition of structure, as it relates to screenwriting, is “the relationship between the parts and the whole.” Since you have to build, or put together, various parts of the screenplay, whether a scene, or the individual shots that comprise the scene, or the separate scenes that make up a sequence, or the necessary character elements you need to integrate into the narrative line, the insertion of a flashback or flashforward structure becomes the glue that holds everything together. It’s like gravity, the force that sustains the entire physical universe.

			When you read and analyze a good screenplay it’s like seeing bits and pieces of film joined together to create a series of moving images, the story told in pictures. A clock ticking, a car moving slowly down a crowded city street, a woman peering out a window, the sound of a baby crying or a dog barking, the car pulling into a parking space, all these bits and pieces of little pictures can be joined together to create a tense and suspense-filled sequence that has the reader, or audience, on the edge of their collective seats. That’s what film is all about, building, or putting together, these little bits and pieces of images that are joined together to create an organic story line. Remember the definition of a screenplay: “a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.”

			When we approach the dynamics of Problem Solving in screenwriting, all the solutions, to whatever the problem, will utilize Structure. That’s because when you fix, or correct, a particular problem, you have to reconstruct, or rebuild, the elements, or content, that make up the narrative line. A story is a whole made up of specific parts: the action, the characters, the locations, sets, scenes, sequences, Acts, Plot Points, music, effects, and so on, all these parts go into the craft of building and putting together a story. It’s the understanding of this relationship between the parts that make up the story, the whole, which allows you to approach Problem Solving from the confidence and security that you know what you’re doing.

			Yes, structure is the foundation of screenwriting, and it’s also an essential part of the problem-solving process. If you have a scene that doesn’t play well, for whatever reason, and you define it as a problem of Plot, Character, or Structure, you’re going to have to go back and create new incidents, episodes, or events to blend into the material, and that’s going to create a new mix. Anything you add is going to have to be restructured and rebuilt; as Newton’s Third Law of Motion states, “For every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction.” For every cause there is an effect, and if you’ve not fleshed out a particular scene to the necessary degree, you’re going to have to go back into that material and change a few things. And whatever you change, you’re going to have to restructure. It’s as simple as that.

			So what kind of problems are you dealing with within the context of Structure?

			First, you have the context of story. Is your story focused, clear, and precise, or does it seem to wander around trying to find its line of action? Even the most complicated script, like The Usual Suspects, is clear and concise, at least from the writer’s point of view. Does your story seem to skirt on the edge of things and not go deeply enough in terms of action and character? Does it appear that your scenes have no dramatic payoff? Do your characters seem to be wandering around searching for their dramatic need?

			All these are symptoms of something that’s not quite right with your structure. It could be the scenes are too short, or not paid off, or the story line seems to wander around with no sense of development, which, remember, is defined as “a line of direction.” In short, with a problem of Structure, something seems to be missing.

			I believe that good structure in a screenplay should not be seen. Good structure should simply disappear into the content of the story line. When I first started developing my concepts of structure, I would go to a movie, watch and notebook in hand, and dutifully time the individual Plot Points, because I wanted to clarify and define screenplay form. Form, not formula. Looking back on it now, I see I was trying to locate and define the building blocks of the screenplay, and what I discovered was that structure was like the DNA of screenwriting.

			When I read a screenplay now, or see a film, I really don’t pay too much attention to structure; I just let the material wash over me. If the script or film doesn’t feel right, if there seems to be some kind of problem, then I’ll go into the material and analyze it structurally. I can recognize structure by the particular beats in the story line. I’ve always maintained that the screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader turning pages, so if I find myself becoming bogged down in the reading experience, that’s a signal there may be something wrong structurally. If I can’t follow the story line, if it wanders around, or something seems to be missing, or if too much is happening, or there are too many characters, or nothing seems to be paid off, that’s a symptom that something’s wrong; that’s when I’ll start breaking it down into its component parts.

			Good structure alone does not make a good screenplay. That’s simply a fact of life that everyone has to remember. So many times people will tell me they’ve written a screenplay “just the way you say it should be done,” and immediately I get suspicious. By the same token the opposite is also true: you can’t have a good screenplay without good structure. Structure is only the foundation, the start point, not the be-all and end-all. Characters, action, dynamic visuals, and strong situations are only some of the things that make up a good screenplay. So many times people ask me for examples of movies that don’t have a good structure and I really can’t give too many examples. That’s because a film without good structure doesn’t hold up. It wanders, is slow to develop, and the only thing that can save it is the dimension of its characters. The audience perceives this, so the film only has a run of a few weeks and then disappears deep into the bowels of the film graveyard.

			The definition of structure, remember, is to build, or to put something together, and as so often happens, when you correct one problem in a screenplay it always affects something else, so you have to add elements, or remove elements, to make it work. That means building, or putting together, a new scene or sequence.

			So what we’ll try to do in this section is uncover various problems that exist as a result of structure, and which can be solved by restructuring the material. And, at the risk of repeating myself again, no matter what the problem, you’re going to have to restructure the material, whether it’s a problem of Plot, Character, or Structure. In the arena of Problem Solving, Structure is an integral part of every solution.

			One of the problems I’ve become aware of in my teaching experience is that writers will sometimes write key scenes, either action or dialogue, which are not paid off; the scenes usually end too early. In a dramatic scene, for example, the screenwriter will cut to the next scene before the purpose of that particular scene is realized. And then, when I’m reading the material, I get the feeling something’s missing; the action feels incomplete. It’s so important—essential—to determine the purpose of the scene in order to dramatically realize the intention of that scene.

			A few years ago I was commissioned to read and analyze a screenplay for a producer/writer. It was an action-thriller set in the Cayman Islands, a marvelous location for this kind of film. The story, about a photographer who accidentally stumbles into a situation where he becomes a target for murder, was interesting and well written. There were good action sequences and the script was well structured.

			But as I was reading the screenplay, I kept getting lost in the story line. I was confused and so many characters were pulled into the narrative line, I didn’t know who the main character was and what the whole thing was about.

			Even though the premise was good, with solid visuals and locations, good action sequences, and interesting characters, somehow I got the feeling that something was missing, something just wasn’t right. I couldn’t pinpoint the problem, so I started examining it more closely. As I read through the screenplay again, I saw that many of the key scenes were not complete, that the action had stopped before the dramatic requirements of the scenes had been satisfied. In the middle of a confrontation scene, for example, the writer would cut away to another scene, or to another character, and this altered the focus of the story line. I had the impression that something was definitely missing.

			With that in mind, I went back and looked at the material again, and saw that this particular trait had become a tendency on the part of the writer. In scene after scene, a scene or situation would be set up, and then before the purpose of the scene was realized, he left the scene; the scene was not really paid off. So while the idea of the scene had been planted, it had never come to fruition, and therefore the action and story line seemed hazy and uncertain.

			Now, I had been aware of this phenomenon before, but I never had a name for it. But this was such a clear example of the problem that I labeled it Sceneus Interruptus. Leaving the scene too early simply means the purpose of the scene is unsatisfied, unfulfilled. It does not accomplish its dramatic function and therefore leaves a gaping hole in the action. And when that happens, something is definitely missing.

			This particular problem could be approached from either Character or Plot, of course, but I chose to put it under the heading of Structure because if you leave the scene too early, you’ve got to add components back into the material in order to reconstruct the unit of dramatic action. That’s how you build tension and pacing, by going into the elements of the material and finding ways of expanding it visually. That’s why when you see a shot of a key being placed in a lock, or thread being stitched into a piece of fabric, or a bullet placed into the chamber of a gun, it expands the visual tension of the scene. That’s why film is such an art form where time can be stretched or condensed and becomes larger than life. Pacing is always related to Structure. If there aren’t enough elements in the scene to hold it together, the chances are it will bog down and not go anywhere. The tension will be dissipated. Conversely, if you have too many elements in the scene, the pacing will also be off, and the material will have a slow, wandering feel to it. Again, no tension.

			In the particular screenplay I had been asked to read, there is a series of short scenes that I’m going to use as an example to illustrate what I’m talking about in terms of Sceneus Interruptus. Now I know the material I’m using is totally out of context, and therefore may not be as illustrative as I would like it to be. But I’m going to take a shot at it anyway.

			The main character, DeFoe, a professional photographer, had been commissioned by the local museum to photograph some ancient artifacts, and a few days later these treasures are stolen and several people are killed. He becomes involved when his studio is ransacked and his assistant killed. In this particular section of the screenplay (it occurs in the Second Half of Act II), one of the major characters, the policeman Gary, is on the hunt, tracking down the first major lead. Gary has uncovered a clue, a utility vehicle a witness claims he had seen leaving the museum around the time the cime was committed.

			The owner of the vehicle has been tracked through the Motor Vehicles Department to a man named Helo, and we know that he is definitely involved in the crime. Gary is snooping around, trying to find out if Helo is really the owner of the vehicle, so he inquires at a neighbor’s apartment hoping to establish that fact. That’s where we’ll start:

			 				INT. HELO’S APARTMENT BUILDING—AFTERNOON

				Gary makes his way down the long, dark, and dingy corridor, stops in front of Apartment 207. Carefully, he scans the area, ready for anything. He knocks on the door.

				We HEAR a muffled voice inside, then the door swings open and a YOUNG WOMAN, obviously expecting someone else, stands in the doorway of her apartment, her smile fading when she sees Gary.



			 				GARY

				Excuse me, but I have a terrible confession to make. I scraped the white truck that’s parked in the garage, and I’m trying to find the owner. Is that your truck? It’s only a scratch, but I’d like to settle things without going through the insurance company.



			 				The woman looks at him for a moment, weighing his words.



			 				WOMAN

				You a cop?



			 				Then she slams the door in his face. Gary stands for a moment, breathing deeply, then moves to the next door, Helo’s apartment. He adjusts his gun, then rings the bell.

				CUT TO:

				EXT. LINSEY’S HOUSE—DAWN

				Linsey (the man responsible for the crime) stares out the window, his back to a woman, Marta, who smokes casually and idly leafs through a fashion magazine.

				CUT TO:

				INT. STAIRWELL, BED AND BREAKFAST—DAY

				A WAITER carries a breakfast tray up the curved, polished wood stairwell and limps down the long corridor bathed in early morning sunshine. He stops at a door and knocks loudly.

				CUT TO:

				INT. BED AND BREAKFAST—DAY

				CARRIE, lying in bed, opens her eyes and looks around for DeFoe (the main character), but the bed is empty. There are photographs spread haphazardly all over the floor.

				CUT TO:

				INT. HELO’S FLAT—DAY

				Helo stands in the doorway, defiant, belligerent, refusing to look directly at Gary.



			 				GARY

				Are you telling me you don’t know anything about that truck…It is yours, isn’t it?”



			And then the writer cuts to yet another scene which is totally unrelated to anything that has been seen or alluded to so far.

			Now, at first glance it may appear that nothing is really “wrong” here, that whatever problem there is might be fixed by simply adding some dialogue or opening up the scenes visually. But if you take the context of the story line into account, you’ll see there’s really no narrative thread. The writer cuts away from the scene before the purpose of the scene is established. And that’s what made me so uncomfortable reading it. This little scene where Gary confronts Helo is way too thin, and really doesn’t say anything that will move the story forward or reveal information about the character. Granted, the whole section is taken out of context, but it’s pretty clear that more has to be added, not only from the story line’s point of view, but also from the character’s perspective. Helo is Gary’s first link to the crime, so we must see these two men warily circling each other before they confront each other. As you can see, the writer cuts away from every scene before anything significant happens. Because the purpose of the scene has not been satisfied (establishing a link between Helo and the crime), cutting away too soon simply dissipates the action. Whatever tension there might have been has simply vanished.

			The result of Sceneus Interruptus can lead to serious problems in the screenplay. Once the tendency of cutting away before the purpose is established, chances are it’s going to be reflected in a variety of scenes, and that means it’s going to influence the entire story line.

			That’s what happens here in this short section. The action seems disjointed and listless, the natural transitions are forced and contrived, and the action moves along like a car with a flat tire. For the reader, concentration is lost, the interest in the story line wanes, and the script is usually shelved before it’s been completely read.

			I think the most difficult thing about this problem is simply recognizing it. So many times we read and reread the material looking for ways to improve it, and we have a hard time seeing that a scene ends too early.

			Once you become aware that the problem exists, you can fix it. And the way to do that is to break every scene down and restructure it into a beginning, middle, and end. First, what’s the purpose of the scene? What’s it doing there? What does the character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the scene? In what way does this scene relate to the character’s dramatic need in the screenplay? Where has the character come from, and where is he/she going after the scene is finished? These questions must be addressed and resolved before the scene begins.

			If you don’t know what’s going on during the scene, who does? That means knowing what the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of your character are, and keeping them clearly in mind as the scene plays out.

			How do you know when you’ve satisfied the requirements of the scene? There’s no real way of knowing that, of course, except that each scene becomes a link in the chain of dramatic action. Each scene, as mentioned, is like a living cell; it should contain everything within it, either to move the story forward or to reveal information about the character. Just like the DNA molecule in living cells. Every scene serves a particular function, and it’s up to you, the screenwriter, to know or determine what that function is. What is its purpose? If you don’t know what it is, or what it does, or why it’s there, you’ll probably have to drop it. Just cut it. The chances are it doesn’t belong in the screenplay. You have to be ruthless when you’re writing a screenplay, especially when you’re trying to solve a problem. Screenwriters all over the world have the same complaint; they always have to cut what they think are their best scenes, their best writing, out of the scripts.

			To solve the problems of Sceneus Interruptus, start by rethinking the parameters of the scene. What are the character’s thoughts, feelings, or emotions when the scene begins? Where is he or she coming from, and what is the emotional reality working on the character? Does your character have a sore throat and does he seem to be cold? Has he/she just managed to escape from a would-be attacker? Is he/she preparing for a big showdown, or confrontation scene? So, define the emotional forces working on your character when the scene begins.

			The next step is to find out what elements you have to work with within the scene. Where does it take place? What time of the day or night? Is there anything within the setting of the scene that you can use to your advantage, dramatically? The weather, a crowded art gallery, a crowded restaurant, a market, or on the street? Or is it late at night, where the silence and emptiness of the location seem to create their own ambience? Once you establish the environmental elements, you can break the scene down into beginning, middle, and end.

			On a separate piece of paper, break down the scene. To start, where does your character come from before the scene begins? Write it down. If the scene takes place in a library, for example, your character may have come from the office, or maybe an exercise class; if the latter, then it means that he will have to dress, leave the area, walk to the subway or car, ride or drive to the destination, park, get out, walk up the steps, and enter the lobby. That’s the beginning. And remember conflict. Maybe something happens on the way to the scene that affects the character, so you might want to create a little back story to the scene.

			Then, find a way to dramatize the purpose of the scene. Why is the character at the library? To find a certain book, do some research on the Internet, or have a clandestine meeting?

			Isolate the flow of events that make up the middle of the scene. The character arrives, walks into the lobby, searches for someone or something, then finds the person or book he or she is looking for, finds a corner table to sit down at, and then the purpose of the scene begins to unfold. What’s the nature of the dialogue? Is it direct, for exposition, so the story can move forward? Or is there a subtext to the dialogue, a hidden meaning, or an indirect threat? Is this a scene that reveals something about the character, that gives us some insight into the emotional or physical landscape of the character? It doesn’t have to be much. In Courage Under Fire we can tell what Colonel Serling is thinking or feeling when he pulls out a bottle of Scotch and takes a long pull. We don’t need any more explanation than that.

			Then, the end. The character(s) get up, leave the library, and then where do they go or what do they do? Do you follow the main character, or the other person? In Pulp Fiction the interesting thing about the bar scene in the beginning where Vinnie (Travolta) meets Butch (Willis) is that we could have followed the Butch character just as easily we do Vinnie on his “date” with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). This is all creative choice. Does anything happen on the way to the next scene? How much time elapses between the scene in the library and the next scene?

			Look it over. Have you satisfied the purpose of the scene? That is, does it contain the correct information, either visually, or emotionally, or physically, or through the dialogue, to be complete within itself, or to act as a link to another scene? As we’ll see in Chapter 19, it’s always better to enter the scene late and get out early, but the only way you can really do that is if you are totally clear on what each beat or movement is, within the body of the scene.

			Is there enough conflict within the scene? Are the characters’ points of view clear, concentrated, and focused? That’s something you have to be clear about yourself. That’s your homework, and nobody can do it but you.

			If you’re not clear about the relationship between the main character and the person he or she is meeting in the library, then write a short, free-association essay of two or three pages about their relationship. When did they first meet, and where? What happened? What you’re really trying to do is to get enough information so you can make sure your scene works and is totally effective for the purpose it serves in the screenplay.

			When you complete the necessary preparation, then do your breakdown of beginning, middle, and end, and then select bits and pieces from each category to set up and then pay off the scene. For example, we could start with a shot of the office clock, followed by a shot of the character looking and thinking, then cut to him or her riding in the subway, or driving, then entering the lobby of the library, searching for the other character, their meeting, and then pay it off with a shot of the character leaving, and walking down the steps, or simply go into a transition. Clean, lean, and tight.

			In this way you know that the purpose of the scene is satisfied, complete unto itself, providing as well a necessary link in the chain of dramatic action, so the story can move forward with concise skill and visual continuity.

			Set-Ups and Pay-offs


			In the first few pages of Thelma & Louise, Thelma is “packing,” literally throwing stuff into a suitcase for their weekend excursion to the mountains, and the last thing she does is open the nightstand drawer next to the bed, and “we see a gun, one Darryl bought her for protection. It is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets. She picks up the gun like it’s a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse…”

			This little scene, more like a mention, doesn’t seem like much at the time, just part of her ditzy character, like eating a frozen candy bar for breakfast one bite at a time. Later, when Thelma and Louise are driving toward their anticipated weekend, Thelma hands the gun to Louise, saying, “You take care of this.” Louise is shocked: “What in the hell did you bring that for?” “Oh, you know…” Thelma replies. “In case there’s any crazy psycho killers on the loose,” and they both laugh at her outrageous behavior. Louise tells her to “put it in my purse.”

			In reality, this little bit seems like a “throwaway,” something to shed light on the character, nothing that’s really too important. It’s only later, when Harlan is in the parking lot, forcing himself on Thelma, that the gun comes into play. Louise takes it out of her purse, orders him to stop, which he does reluctantly, and when he exchanges words with her, she loses it and blows him away.

			This gun is integral to the plot of the screenplay. If Thelma had not taken the gun with her, had not given it to Louise, Harlan would not have been killed, they would not become fugitives from the law, and the whole story wouldn’t have happened; in short, if there were no gun there wouldn’t have been any Thelma & Louise.

			Setting up some of the various story elements of the screenplays is essential to the art of Problem Solving. Whether a particular element, an object or an event, deals with setting up the story, setting up a character, or character trait, understanding when and when not to establish a story point is the difference between a script that works and one that does not.

			The setting up of these story elements often becomes the “glue” that holds everything together, which is why it’s a problem of Structure, not Plot or Character. If it ain’t on the page, it ain’t on the stage is the old Hollywood expression, and knowing when to set something up and then pay it off is fundamental to the craft of screenwriting.

			Different things must be set up, then incorporated into the story line—that’s one of the principal rules of all writing. One of the most important elements is setting up the dramatic premise of the screenplay; that is, what the story is about. The Set-Up also refers to setting up the first ten pages of the screenplay, establishing the inciting incident, as well as providing enough exposition to move the story forward. Setting up these elements gives texture and direction, the natural line of development, to the narrative.

			Characters also have to be set up, along with their characteristics and manners of behavior. Character aspects serve a variety of dramatic functions, like Louise knowing how to handle a gun. What happened to her in Texas when she was growing up, the Circle of Being, is a character element that is essential to know. As mentioned earlier, it was Louise, the young girl raped in Texas, who really pulled the trigger, not the Louise of the present.

			If certain elements of character are set up, then they have to be paid off. In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne had been a respectable banker in a Portland, Maine, bank, before being convicted of his wife’s murder, so he knows enough about the system to create a fictitious identity, to establish a phony driver’s license, birth certificate, and passport as well as duplicate a set of account books. So we believe he could take the warden’s money—which he has laundered and deposited in banks all over the Portland, Maine, area—to Mexico. “On the outside,” he says to Red, “I was an honest man. I had to come to prison to learn how to be a crook.” And that information, which had been set up early in the screenplay, was not finally paid off until the end of the Second Act. So it really doesn’t matter where the story point is paid off, as long as it’s set up properly, whether it’s related to the character or the plot.

			There are other elements that need to be set up in a screenplay, specific objects, for example, like the gun in Thelma & Louise, or the rock hammer in The Shawshank Redemption. These particular objects are essential to the story line, so they need to be planted in the screenplay at different points within the landscape of the story. In The Shawshank Redemption we have seen the warden giving Andy clothes to take to the prison laundry, and shoes to shine, so when he gives Andy his clothes and shoes on the night he makes his escape, it’s totally believable, meaning it’s paid off. The “willing suspension of disbelief” has been set up and we buy it. It’s good writing.

			So understanding how to set up characters, situations, and objects in a screenplay and then paying them off is necessary to the Problem-Solving process.

			This was something I had to learn in my own screenwriting experience. When I first started writing screenplays, I didn’t know anything. I didn’t know what a screenplay was, I didn’t know what it meant to tell a story with pictures, I had no idea about structure or building a story, and didn’t know anything about setting up a story or situation, or paying it off, for that matter. Though I had been an English major at UC Berkeley, as well as a published film and book reviewer, I still didn’t have the foggiest notion about the nature and craft of screenwriting.

			When I began experimenting with the screenplay form, I understood I had to learn it, literally, from the ground up. Which meant I had to teach myself how to write a screenplay. There were no books or anything about it, and the only thing I had at my disposal was Lajos Egri’s great book The Art of Dramatic Writing, written in the forties about the craft of playwriting. So I did the only thing I could do: I got hold of some screenplays from the two filmmakers I admired the most and started reading and rereading the material.

			These were really my mentors in the art and craft of screenwriting. I have mentioned Jean Renoir’s contribution to my understanding of film education in both Screenplay and The Screenwriter’s Workbook. But I consider two writer-directors to have been my teachers, and both were masters of the cinema. One of them was the great Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and The Ballad of Cable Hogue, to name just a few). I was so impressed with Peckinpah’s Ride the High Country that I wrote a piece for the magazine Film Quarterly on it. A few years later I had the great good fortune of being with Sam when he was actually writing The Wild Bunch, and we spent many an afternoon in Malibu talking about the West from Peckinpah’s point of view. It was quite an extraordinary time in my life. Peckinpah’s style, his mastery of storytelling, was an incredible education in the art of screenwriting. Especially the way he introduced and set up certain story points.

			The other filmmaker I studied was the magnificent, revolutionary, and influential Michelangelo Antonioni. The Italian director is a master of setting up and weaving emotional attitudes and characterizations throughout his films. I was so impressed and inspired when I saw La Notte (The Night), that I literally began my writing career with it, and thus entered the world of contemporary film. La Notte is masterful study about the relationship and values of a well-to-do Italian couple. The way Antonioni sets up his characters, his mastery of the situation, the visual expressions of behavior, were revolutionary in terms of film, and when you see any of his films today, they stand firmly on the timeless pedestal of great film art. During the last few years I’ve had the privilege of getting to know Antonioni (he’s the only director I address as Maestro), and I’m as much in awe of him today as I ever was. The way he sets up an emotional situation in just a few visual strokes is phenomenal.

			These filmmakers taught me everything. And, as mentioned, I was so struck with Peckinpah’s Ride the High Country that I decided that this was what great screenwriting was all about. So when I managed to get hold of the script of Major Dundee (written by Peckinpah with Oscar Saul), I think I must have read it at least a hundred times, analyzing it, taking it apart, memorizing it scene by scene, action by action, character by character, trying to understand what made it tick and what made it work so successfully. It was a wonderful education.

			The script, like so many of Peckinpah’s films, was a Western (he loved the theme of “unchanged men in a changing time,” which he incorporated in almost every film he did), and takes place right after the Civil War. The story concerns an obsessed renegade Union officer, Charlton Heston, who refuses to accept the peace between the North and South even though the war is over. A major in the Confederate army, he fled to Mexico rather than accept the peace treaty. He’s determined to fight his own war. In this case he breaks a group of misfits out of prison and together they hunt the band of Apaches responsible for the slaughter that opens the screenplay.

			The script opens at a ranch on the frontier on Halloween. The men, women, and children are preparing for the large celebration and it’s a joyous and festive time, with the children playing “cowboys and Indians” in makeshift holiday masks and warpaint, as the grown-ups dance and enjoy themselves getting ready for the evening’s feast.

			But as the children play their games, we suddenly start cross-cutting between the costumed children and a band of renegade Apaches creeping toward the ranch house in what will eventually turn into a bloody massacre. The fierceness of their faces, emblazoned in war paint, contrasted with the children’s decorated faces, and surrounded with the festive music of the fiddles playing and the people dancing, is as visually striking as it is terrifying. When the massacre begins, the laughs and squeals of the children are interwoven with the war cries of the attacking Apaches, resulting in a truly memorable sequence.

			The opening is a remarkable example of the power and magic of film. (Unfortunately, because of budgetary problems, the studio brutally recut the film. Peckinpah wanted to take his name off it, but the studio prevailed.) It is this particular incident, the inciting incident, that sets up the entire film, and the story line is a reaction to this event, tracing the obsession of the renegade Union officer, Major Dundee (Heston), who relentlessly tracks down the Apaches, hoping to avenge the massacre of the homesteaders.

			The script of Major Dundee is a wonderful illustration of how to set up the dramatic premise of the story line. Sometimes, going back over the material you’ve written, you may find a scene or a sequence that seems unclear, or maybe you think the dialogue needs to be sharpened, or another scene added to clarify the narrative or define the character, and many times the problem can be solved by making sure that certain story elements have been set up appropriately. Setting up necessary story elements, then paying them off, allows you to keep the story moving forward. No moments are too small or too subtle to be set up. If these points are not set up appropriately, the reader will sometimes shift his or her focus away from the story. And this, of course, results in a “problem.”

			There are a several good examples of how you set things up in order to pay them off later. If you do want to set something up, think of it as a “noun”; you’re going to be setting up a “person, place, or thing,” either a character, or a situation, or an object. As mentioned, Thelma & Louise is a great example: the gun Thelma puts into her purse at the beginning of the film is paid off at Plot Point I when Harlan is shot in the parking lot. In that case it was setting up an object, or “thing.” Setting up her character, in order to expand the situation, is revealed later when Louise was raped in Texas. As a matter of fact, when you read the screenplay of this film, everything is carefully set up from the very beginning; Louise’s relationship with her boyfriend, Jimmy, actually the back story that results in the two women going to the mountains for the weekend; and tracing the emotional arc of Thelma’s growth from being locked in her marriage with Darryl in the opening allows her to grow into a free-thinking, independent woman.

			When and where to set up things in a scene, sequence, or act, and when, where, and how to pay them off, means knowing your story and characters well. If you don’t know the basic and essential elements of your story line, or if you’re vague and unclear about the progression of events, or the character’s arc, this lack of information, this lack of preparation, will often create problems in the screenplay. This is really what writing’s all about, asking yourself the right questions so you can reach levels that keep the story moving forward with depth and dimension. It creates a framework of universality around your work. This is your responsibility as writer; if you don’t know what’s going on in your story, then who does?

			There are times in the screenplay when a particular piece of information, or a physical item, is set up in one scene, and then paid off in the very next. Or the information or object can be paid off several scenes later, or even later than that, as is the case in The Shawshank Redemption and Crimson Tide.

			In Shawshank, at Plot Point I, Andy Dufresne approaches Red for the first time and asks if he can get him a rock hammer. Red asks some questions about it, and through Andy’s answers we begin to see and understand a little bit about his character; on the outside, before he was sent to prison, he was a “rock hound.” That, of course, sets up an important piece of information we need to know, that will be paid off at the end of Act II. Later, we see the hammer being “delivered,” and then, as Act II unfolds, the rock hammer, and rock cloths, are only referred to, and shown in a few shots. After we’ve seen the hammer a few times, it’s something we simply take for granted. Only at Plot Point II is the rock hammer really paid off and we “see,” through the flashback, how Andy escaped from prison. Suddenly, all those little scenes and references make a lot of sense.

			What happens when you don’t set up these story points properly, or pay them off appropriately? You’ll notice that the story line appears to lose momentum and seems to wander around in search of itself. When I’m reading a script and I feel my focus shifting and my interest waning, I start looking for what’s going on, the “through line” of the story. If I don’t find it, if I have to keep looking for what the story’s about, that’s an indication that something’s missing; either a particular story point or a character or an object needs to be set up, or accentuated more.

			The symptoms of a failure to set things up properly are pretty obvious, and different for every screenplay, of course, but they all share some similar traits; take a look at the Problem Sheet, and you’ll see that problems of this nature seem to make the material soft, so it might seem that there’s a lack of conflict, or the story line has no focus and wanders around looking for direction, insight, and clarity. Sometimes various story points will be introduced and then left hanging and unresolved. As you’re rereading the material, you’ll probably find yourself asking, “What happened to this or that point?” or “What’s this story really about?” so the action appears to be washed out and the story unfolds on a single narrative line without any dimension, tension, or suspense.

			It doesn’t work. Things that are set up have to be paid off. Structure, as we’ve seen, is the relationship between the parts and the whole, and each part is directly related to the whole, so if you set something up, whether it’s a story point, or situation, or a particular object, it has to be paid off. Otherwise, whatever you’ve set up doesn’t make any sense. Can you imagine a film like The English Patient (Anthony Minghella) working as well as it did without the principal issues of the story line in relationship to the characters having been set up?

			If you feel there’s a problem because something has not been set up properly, or paid off, go back into the material and determine where you set it up, and then how it’s paid off. Whether it helped to set up the story’s premise, or a particular plot element, find out the specific location where you first introduced it, then how you did it, and whether through a visual image or in an exchange of dialogue.

			We can learn so much from The Shawshank Redemption in terms of setting up the dramatic premise and the inciting incident. As mentioned earlier, the opening sequence incorporates three threads of dramatic action; one, Andy Dufresne is sitting outside in his car drinking, when he takes the gun out of his glove compartment as we witness his wife and her lover in the house wrapped in an erotic embrace; two, we see him on trial being cross-examined by the prosecutor for the murder of his wife and her lover; and, and three, the judge sentences him to two life terms back to back, and then we cut to the prison, where we’re introduced to Red.

			That’s the first ten pages of the screenplay. In the second ten pages he enters prison and we see things through his eyes; this audience-character bond allows us to identify with him and what he’s going through. Audience and character should always be united by the dramatic action; the audience learns as the character learns what’s going on.

			At this point in the story I really didn’t know whether Andy Dufresne was guilty or innocent. But as the story line unfolded, it really didn’t matter. At Plot Point I, the first moment he approaches Red to request the rock hammer, he learns the “truth”; in prison, everybody’s innocent, so as I was watching the film, it never really occurred to me to wonder whether he was innocent or guilty. That wasn’t the story; the story was about his relationship with Red and how he adapts to life inside prison. It’s only later, at Pinch II, when Tommy tells him that a former cell mate had confessed to committing the murder of his wife and lover, that we understand Andy is really innocent. And while this is set up within the first ten pages of the screenplay, Andy’s actual guilt or innocence is not paid off until almost the end of Act II.

			So what’s your story about? Have you set it up properly in the first ten pages? If you feel there’s a problem in setting up something, go back into the material and see what it is that you’ve failed to establish. What needs to be set up? Is it essential to the story? Is it a story point within the script, or a “thing,” like the gun in Thelma & Louise, or the rock hammer in Shawshank? Or maybe it’s an integral part of the character that needs to be set up. Or maybe it’s answering the question of what happened and why the plane is shot down and crashes at the beginning of The English Patient. It’s up to you as the writer to clarify and define what it is that needs to be set up, and then go back into the script and determine the best way to solve that particular problem.

			In Crimson Tide the story is set up from the opening scene of the screenplay. A news reporter is shown at sea on an aircraft carrier and he explains, with the help of actual newsreel footage, that a band of Russian rebels have taken over the government and are threatening to launch a nuclear attack against the U.S. In response, the nuclear sub Alabama is ordered to sea, and Act I is devoted to setting up the Russian threat, introducing and setting up the Denzel Washington character—Hunter, the XO—and the Gene Hackman character—Ramsey, the captain of the vessel—and preparing the sub for its mission. At Plot Point I the sub casts off and begins its underwater mission.

			That basically sets up the story. But there’s another dimension here, and that’s the setting up of the characters. I’ve already mentioned Captain Ramsey’s dog, and how the little Jack Russell terrier goes everywhere with him. It’s a wonderful touch. But the Hunter character is somewhat different. First of all, we learn that he spent a year at Harvard, which makes him “suspicious” in the eyes of Ramsey; he’s an “intellectual,” and that sets up a situation that might create problems with Ramsey’s journeyman ethics as the captain of the nuclear sub. More important, however, is when Ramsey asks Hunter about his likes or hobbies, and Hunter replies that he rides horses. “What’s the best horse you’ve ever ridden?” Ramsey asks. “Arabian,” Hunter replies. That impresses Ramsey. Just a little exchange, and, at first glance it could easily be a throwaway line, something to just illuminate the difference in character.

			But that line about the horses is introduced where it is so it can help set up the clash between the two characters that explodes at Mid-Point; because the radio has been damaged when the emergency action message has been cut off before it is complete.

			The First Half of Act II deals with expanding the characters and clarifying their points of view. Drama is conflict, remember, so one of the first scenes in this unit of dramatic action shows the officers sitting at their first meal, in a scene said to have been written by Robert Towne. Hunter is the new member of the crew, so the captain, Ramsey, is trying to find out what his philosophy of war is, and what kind of “man” his new XO is, what he believes in. The difference between “you and me,” Ramsey explains, is that when “I was taught, things were simpler in a war situation; I was taught how to push a button and told when to do it.” It’s not a question of strategy, he states, but simply a matter of military and political procedure. And he quotes von Clausewitz. He pauses for a moment, then continues his observation: it’s different now, he says; the brass, meaning the Pentagon, want you (referring to Hunter) to know “why you’re doing it.” The Denzel Washington character nods in agreement, then responds “that in a nuclear world the true enemy can’t be destroyed, because the real enemy is war itself.”

			This little dialogue exchange succinctly summarizes the differences in their philosophies of war. It also shows us the differences in their points of view, because it is this conflict that fuels the entire film. If the differences in their points of view had not been set up and established, the entire story would fail to work; there would be no conflict, no mutiny attempt, no story, and the Alabama would just cruise the waters until the situation in Russia resolved itself. Basically, their differing points of view would be like two parallel lines moving toward infinity without ever connecting. That’s not how you build and structure a screenplay.

			Some screenwriters might argue that the scene is too direct, too obvious, and they would either omit it or write it in a more subtle way. But some scenes in a screenplay have to be written directly, no matter how obvious, or expository, they are, and this happens to be one of them. It is set up to be paid off later so it can follow the natural law of cause and effect, action and reaction. If the essential seed of the screenplay is planted appropriately, in the right place and at the right time, it can blossom into a full-grown narrative, replete with the structural and character dimension.

			It’s all in how you set it up. Establishing Hunter’s interest in riding horses in the very beginning, the third scene of the screenplay to be exact, sets us up for what follows. When the conflict between their characters explodes at Mid-Point, Ramsey insists they follow the orders received to launch ten nuclear missiles against Russia rather than wait for the confirmation of the incomplete second emergency action message received. This results in Hunter’s taking over the sub and placing Ramsey under arrest.

			Later, when a small group of men regain control of the Alabama for Ramsey the radio is almost repaired. Ramsey gives Hunter three minutes for the radio to be fixed so the message can be completed; if, at the end of three minutes, the message is not received, he’s going to launch the missiles as ordered.

			So begins a long three-minute wait. It’s an ideal moment for tension and suspense. In the scene, which it is said that Quentin Tarantino wrote, Ramsey asks Hunter if he knows about the Lipizzaner stallions. They’re all white, he adds, almost as an afterthought. Hunter nods, yes, he knows about them. Again, this kind of dialogue emphasizes their character differences; it illuminates that one of them is “right,” and one of them is “wrong.” When the EAM message is finally received, it orders the Alabama to cancel the previous orders of the nuclear missile strike. Hunter has been proven “right.”

			This “right” and “wrong” scenario is then resolved, or paid off, in the last scene of the film, the little tag. The military tribunal assembled to weigh evidence in the case of the two men, clearly determines that both men “were right” in their actions. What they did only points up the ambiguity of the military law that was then on the books. As they stand outside the courthouse, Hunter pays off the horse scene that was set up early in the film. He tells the captain that the Lipizzaner stallions are from Spain, not Portugal, and at birth, they are black, not white. (See explanation this page.) Another case of “being right,” as it reflects the basic conflict in the film. It is a powerful statement, made more powerful in the way it is set up at the very beginning.

			Crimson Tide is a very good film and it reflects the nature of the classic “tragic situation.” Hegel, the nineteenth-century German philosopher, always proclaimed that the true nature of tragedy is not a conflict between “good and evil,” or “right and wrong,” but resides in the conflict between “good versus good,” or “right versus right.” Both sides of the conflict are right in the actions they pursue. And Crimson Tide personifies this in an exciting and entertaining presentation. It’s a very good film.

			The setting up and paying off of story points is integral to the art and craft of screenwriting. Every scene, every sequence, every Plot Point and story point, must be set up, established, and then, at the right moment, paid off. Nothing can be set up without later being paid off.

			For every action, remember, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

			Enter Late and Get Out Early


			In William Goldman’s book Adventures in the Screen Trade, he talks about the best place to enter the scene, and to hypothetically illustrate his point he gives an example. Suppose, he says, you’re writing a scene in which a reporter is interviewing a subject, and it’s laid out like this: The reporter arrives at the place of the interview, the two introduce themselves to each other, get comfortable, chat for a while, and after a few moments the reporter suggests they start the interview. So he turns on the cassette recorder, pulls out his notepad, and starts asking his questions. They discuss the topic, going back and forth for a while until the reporter is satisfied and terminates the discussion. He turns off the recorder, thanks the subject, picks up his belongings and prepares to leave, says his good-bye, and walks to the door. But when he reaches the door, he suddenly stops as if struck with an afterthought, turns back to the subject, and says, “Oh, by the way. One last question…”

			Where is the best place for the screenwriter to enter the scene? When the reporter arrives? When he turns on his recorder? At some point during the interview? At the end? None of the above, Goldman says. Instead, he feels the best place for the screenwriter to enter the scene is when the reporter is standing at the door, on his way out, and remembers “one last question.”

			Every screenwriter deliberates this question, mulls it over and over, and finally, at some point, decides where to enter the scene. What’s the best point to enter the scene? When I first read this in Goldman’s book it always struck me as being a good rule of thumb, so when I was writing my book Selling a Screenplay, I thought I might give it a try just to see what happened.

			I had an interview with Peter Guber scheduled, just before he took over control of Sony Pictures, so I decided to see whether Goldman’s advice worked in real life as well as in the screenplay. We met in his office on a beautiful cloudy day in L.A., and I had a list of questions laid out in my notepad, and we spent an informative session together discussing what a buyer looks for when a company is considering purchasing material.

			When I completed the interview and it came time to leave, I turned off the cassette recorder, got up, and put on my jacket. I walked to the door, then I paused, turned to him, and said, “Oh, by the way, one last question: Why do some movies get made and others don’t?” Which had been my key question right from the beginning. He laughed, and asked why I’m wearing the jacket I’m wearing, and why is he wearing the jacket he’s wearing? Still standing at the door, we started talking about the market and personal taste, but as he started getting into it and answering my question, I took off my jacket, sat back down, and turned the cassette recorder back on. Peter Guber is a pretty amazing, as well as astute, producer and we sat there for another forty-five minutes talking about why some movies get made and others don’t. It was really a fascinating discussion and provided the most intriguing and insightful part of the interview with Peter Guber. And most of the chapter on producers draws upon this part of the interview and gives great insight into the moviemaking process.

			I use this interview in many of my screenwriting courses as an example to help clarify and define the best point at which to enter the scene. So many times a screenwriter starts a scene and fills it with unnecessary dialogue that basically says nothing, and by the time the purpose of the scene is revealed, the scene is way too long and whatever dramatic tension should have been, or might have been there, is lost in a plethora of empty dialogue.

			So, what’s the best point to enter the scene? A good rule of thumb is to “enter late and get out early.” Which means that in many scenes (depending on their purpose) it’s best to enter the action at the last possible moment. I usually tell my students that you enter the scene about two lines before the purpose of the scene is revealed. In this way you only need a minimum of dialogue to state the dramatic purpose.

			Now this, of course, is only a general rule; it doesn’t apply to every scene in the screenplay, because the dramatic function of each scene is singular and unique. Some scenes have to be constructed, or built, in terms of their beginning, middle, and end, and it always depends on what information you need to communicate, either to move the story forward, or to satisfy the dramatic purpose of the particular scene. Where you enter the scene is absolutely an individual decision, and hopefully the scene itself will dictate the best point to enter. If you’re able to see it.

			The same principle applies to ending the scene. At what point do you leave one scene so you can move into the next? The main things to remember about getting out of one scene and into the next are: First get out with a sense of tension so the reader will want to see what happens next. Second, make the transition from one scene into the next interesting, visually arresting, smooth. Remember that it’s the writer’s responsibility to keep the reader turning pages.

			If you write a scene that is complete unto itself, it will have a definite beginning, middle, and end, and if you do that consistently, you’ll end up with an episodic, or sequential, screenplay. Every scene has a definite end, a definite place to get out; you just have to find it, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s transitional, or deliberate (like a fade-out). Every scene should lead into the next one, like a force of nature, spring turning into summer. The connection between these units of dramatic action, whether effected by picture-to-picture, sound-to-sound, dialogue-to-dialogue, or special-effect-to-special-effect transitions, should always be pulling and guiding you from one scene into the next. The story must always move forward, from beginning to end, beginning to end.

			Just look at The English Patient; the relationship between the two lovers is the focal point of the story, and how the love affair grows and blossoms between the Ralph Fiennes (Almásy) and Kristin Scott Thomas (Katherine) characters is always unfolding. As Fiennes is languishing on his deathbed, vividly recalling his memories, we learn what happened between them. The script itself is a distinct mosaic being pieced together by the context of their emotional relationship. So the end of the film is seen at the beginning of the film, a “bookend” device that works wonderfully.

			In order to keep the tension going, and keep the reader turning pages, enter late and get out early. That’s what screenwriting is all about.

			If you don’t pay attention to the point at which you enter the scene, there is a possibility that your screenplay will drag and sag, or be too long, so that the sense of tension and suspense is lost, and if that happens, the chances are you’ll be overwhelmed with problems of a script that is not working. This is really not too unusual. Many times I’ve received screenplays that are very long, well over a hundred and fifty pages, and as I go through the material, the first thing I notice is that the screenwriters have usually started their scenes too early and have had to fill them with unnecessary dialogue. You know: “How are you? Nice to see you again. Won’t you sit down? What’s going on?”

			When and where you enter the scene is the central question as you set about structuring each particular moment of the screenplay. To do that you need to ask yourself certain questions: What is the purpose of the scene? Why is it there? Does it move the story forward? Does it reveal information about the character? Is it driven by the need for exposition, or transition? If you don’t know the answers to these questions, who does?

			There are many times when the scenes are too long and episodic and the writer has to rethink and create a new approach to them. What is the problem? If it’s Plot, you have to approach it from one perspective; if Character, from another; and if it’s a Structural problem, still another. The writer can approach the problem by first breaking the scene down into its component parts, beginning, middle, and end, and then spend time rethinking the elements of the scene; describing the location, what it looks like, the various aspects or dynamics of character that need to be revealed. By refocusing on these components, it’s easy to judge whether you are entering too early or too late. If too early you’ll probably find the scene is approximately two or three pages long and top heavy with trite and unimportant dialogue, redundant and verbose. Yet there are other times, when you enter too late, where the true dramatic purpose is unrealized, and then the scene comes out short and the story line seems vague and unfulfilled.

			Every scene, as we know, has a definite beginning, middle, and end. If you have a problem that answers to some of the symptoms listed on the Problem Sheet, restructure and redefine the scene into its basic parts of beginning, middle, and end. This way you can reevaluate some of those long scenes that seem to achieve no dramatic purpose except to slow the narrative down. The same exercise can be used if the scenes are too short and don’t give enough information to move the story forward.

			How do you determine the best place to enter the scene? That’s the real question. I think the only way to gauge this is to ask yourself what happens before the scene begins, what happens during the scene, and what happens after the scene is over. Whether your scene takes place in an office, or at a concert, or in a car, where does the scene begin, what is its middle, and how does it end?

			Let’s say you have an important scene that’s too long, too wordy, and drags the action down. And let’s say, just as an example, that your scene takes place in an office. The first question to ask yourself is where is your character coming from before the scene begins? From his or her office? From a meeting outside the office? From home or the airport? What is the purpose of the scene, and what function does it serve? In other words, why is it there? And from the other characters’ point of view, what are they doing when your character enters the office? Are they in the middle of a phone call or conversation? What’s the back story to the scene? Are there any pleasantries exchanged? Or are the characters irritated and pissed off? When the characters enter the office, maybe your main character might be asked to wait before entering in turn. Conflict, remember? Getting your character into the office would be the beginning of the scene. So you could enter the scene anywhere along the flow of physical action of getting the character to the office.

			The middle would be the actual conversation taking place. What’s the conversation about? How does it fit within the context of the story? What function does it serve? Does it move the story forward or does it reveal information about the character? Is it a dramatically charged scene, or is it mainly subtext, meaning that what’s not said is more important than what is said?

			As far as I’m concerned, subtext should, if possible, become a major part of each scene. For example, in The English Patient, a formal dinner party is being given and Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her husband, Colin, are getting ready to leave. The war is becoming a reality and getting too close and their archeological expedition has been shut down. Now, we know that Almásy and Katherine are deeply in love. The scene opens with the group seated around the long table, when Almásy walks through the door drunk and, with only a few lines of dialogue, makes a total fool of himself. The dramatic purpose of the scene is not found in the dialogue, it is seen in what is not said: the looks, the uncomfortable glances from Katherine; her husband, tense and uptight; and the other people there trying to endure the embarrassing behavior of Almásy. It is during this scene that Colin, Katherine’s husband, suspects, maybe knows, that his wife and Almásy are having an affair. From Almásy’s point of view, he knows he has fallen hopelessly in love with her, does not want her to leave, and cannot stand to see her with her husband. It’s a beautiful scene that on an obvious level shows us the drunken words and gestures of a person who is hurting deep inside, but more importantly conveys the character’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions by the words that are not said. The dialogue itself during this encounter is really irrelevant. That’s subtext.

			Getting back to our office scene, what happens at the end? Does the character say his or her good-byes and simply leave? Does the character go back to his or her own office, leave the building, or get into a car or cab and then we move into the next scene? In other words, what’s the ending of the scene?

			When my students find themselves in this dilemma, and have to deal with this kind of problem, I have them break down the scene and lay out the parameters of beginning, middle, and end. Again, what is the purpose of the scene? Where does it take place? How does the character get into the scene? When those answers are known, then I have them list these events on a separate piece of paper so they can determine which elements lead up to the character’s entering the scene, what events take place during the scene, and what happens when the scene is over. When they have completed this little exercise on a separate piece of paper, they have three complete columns of beginning, middle, and end, for these events lead up to, are part of, and conclude the scene.

			Then I ask them to examine the characters’ emotional state. What are the characters thinking and feeling before they enter the scene? Is there an emotional subtext? What is their dramatic need in this particular scene? What do they really want to say (basically stating the purpose of the scene), and what is said to them? If there’s any doubt or question in the students’ minds, I have them write the scene out in an obvious and direct way. What is this scene really about? Just write it and don’t worry about whether it says what you want it to say. There’s still time for that. Sometimes I’ll have them do this in a free-association essay, of a couple of paragraphs or a page. This is only background to the scene.

			Then, move on. What is the character’s point of view during the scene? Does it alter or affect the scene? How so? What about the other person(s) in the scene? What are their thoughts, feelings, and emotions before the scene begins? And what is their point of view during the scene? What is their dramatic need in the scene? Do they achieve it? Every character in the scene has a different agenda, a different dramatic need, and it’s important, absolutely essential, for writers to know what that need is so they can express it either visually or through dialogue.

			If you’re unclear about what the relationship is between the characters interacting in the scene, write a short two- or three-page essay about them. Free-associate. What is their relationship? Where or how did they meet? What is their purpose in being together? Do they like or dislike each other? What is their point of view? What is it that keeps them together? Where did they come from before the scene begins, and again, what thoughts, feelings, or emotions do they carry into the scene? Why are they there and what do they want to get or achieve in the scene? All these points should be determined so you can enter the scene at the best moment dramatically. Once you know the answers to these questions, then enter the scene a few lines before the purpose of the scene is stated.

			Enter late and get out early. It makes for a good reading experience, as well as moving the story forward. Here’s a example from The Shawshank Redemption. It’s a scene that takes place in the First Half of Act II, and occurs right after the tarring-of-the-roof sequence when Andy tells the prison guard Hadley how to keep the $35,000 he inherited from his brother and, in exchange, manages to obtain some beer for his fellow inmates, which he does not drink. Be aware of the scene in terms of beginning, middle, and end.

			 				EXT—PRISON YARD—THE BLEACHERS—DAY

				Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move.



			 				RED

				King me.



			 				ANDY

				Chess. Now, there’s a game of kings.

				Civilized…strategic…



			 				RED

				…and totally fuckin’ inexplicable.

				Hate that game.



			 				ANDY

				Maybe you’ll let me teach you someday.

				I’ve been thinking of getting a board together.



			 				RED

				You come to the right place. I’m the man who can get things.



			 				ANDY

				We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I’d like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz…the opposing side in limestone.



			 				RED

				That’d take you years.



			 				ANDY

				Years I’ve got. What I don’t have are the rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim.



			 				RED

				How’s that rock hammer workin’ out, anyway? Scratch your name on your wall yet?



			 				ANDY

				Not yet. I suppose I should.



			 				RED

				Andy? I guess we’re gettin’ to be friends, ain’t we?



			 				ANDY

				I suppose we are.



			 				RED

				I ask a question? Why’d you do it?



			 				ANDY

				I’m innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here.



			 				Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing.



			 				ANDY

				What are you in for, Red?



			 				RED

				Murder. Same as you.



			 				ANDY

				Innocent?



			 				RED

				The only guilty man in Shawshank.



			And we cut to the next scene.

			This little scene is a masterpiece of understatement, and though short, it reveals many different facets of their character. Even though the scene is taken out of context, it is an insightful illustration of entering late and getting out early.

			First, what’s the purpose of the scene? You could say there are a couple of things here; first and foremost the scene reveals information about the characters. As mentioned, this particular scene takes place near the beginning of the Second Act, so it’s really a scene about them solidifying their relationship. As Red says, “I guess we’re gettin’ to be friends, ain’t we?”

			We can also see the difference between Andy and Red, in terms of background and interests; they’re playing checkers, a game that most everyone knows, but Andy would rather be playing chess and as far as Red is concerned, chess is “totally fuckin’ inexplicable. Hate that game,” he says. So much for that. What it does reveal is a vast difference in terms of their backgrounds and interests. The two men met because Andy wanted to obtain a rock hammer and to further pursue his interests as a rock hound, he wants to carve the chess pieces himself, “one side done in quartz…the opposing side in limestone.” This says something about him. He was probably raised in a solid middle-class or upper-middle-class family, he’s intelligent, logical, a good craftsman, he pays close attention to detail, likes to make things, and is always looking to see how things work by taking them apart. He’s a hands-on kind of person, and of course Red’s line about “scratching his name on the wall” is setting us up for the way he escapes from Shawshank Prison.

			But there’s another element in this scene as well: when Red asks why he killed his wife, Andy replies humorously, “I’m innocent, remember? Just like everybody else in here.” And the stage directions say that “Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing.” Andy senses this and asks, “What are you in for, Red?” “Murder. Same as you.” “Innocent?” Andy inquires, smiling slightly. But Red is serious: “The only guilty man in Shawshank.” We hold for a moment, then cut to the next scene.

			The scene ends on a statement that really raises more questions than it answers. Whom did Red murder? Why? How old was he when he committed the crime? What were the circumstances surrounding his act? We leave the scene before we have any answers. We get out at a moment of thoughtfulness, a natural end to this particular scene, but it spurs us on to know more about Red. Only later do we learn about the crime that brought Red to Shawshank. But entering late and getting out early keeps the tension going and the reader turning pages.

			It’s a good “rule” to remember.

			If we wanted to break this scene into the elements of beginning, middle, and end, it would begin with Andy and Red in the yard, walking up the bleacher steps, laying out the checkerboard and pieces, and they would start playing the game. The middle would deal with the game itself, and the dialogue would play, as it does, over the action of checker moves of the two men. The end would be when the game is over. They’d pack up their goods, either with dialogue or in silence, and they would walk back to the cell block. They’re getting closer as friends, but there’s still a distance between them, otherwise Andy would have answered Red’s question on a more serious note. It’s the manner in which he says it that implies that he actually committed the crime, and of course, that’s what we’re being set up to believe.

			The scene is structured so we begin toward the end of the middle section. “King me,” Red says in the opening line. Which means they’ve been playing awhile, because you don’t king someone in checkers until you’ve made several moves to get into the right position. So the scene opens toward the end of the middle section and that’s exactly what this little dialogue exchange is; a little “window” allowing us to learn what we’re supposed to learn about their characters, and then moving on.

			That’s where we enter. And we get out early, after the last thought, Red’s admission of guilt, is stated but before it’s completed. If the author had wanted to continue the scene, Andy would have asked Red why and how he committed the murder. But he doesn’t. We don’t learn that until much later. We entered the scene late and then we got out early, before the explanation of how and why Red did what he did.

			Where you enter depends upon the dramatic purpose of the scene, and where you end it depends on what you’re leading into for the next scene. Structuring the scene so you enter late and get out early is what keeps the action moving forward smoothly, seamlessly. When I read a good screenplay, the reading experience is smooth and easy, and the pages have an almost liquid texture, with each scene continually moving the story forward. The only way I can describe it is by saying a good read is like “honey on the page.”

			And a good read is what we’re all looking for.

			Okay, Fasten Your Seat Belts


			OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS, HERE IT COMES….

			That’s the line that begins the Third Act of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, one of the most significant action films of the last decade. Not only is the action singular and the characters sound, but it is the uniqueness of James Cameron’s vision that drives the film into our consciousness. The same holds true with any great film, whether it be an action-adventure, science-fiction, or mystery thriller, or simply a great action sequence nailed into the scenario of a good drama or detective story. The Star Wars trilogy has been rereleased with astonishing results, once again proving that the action film, accompanied by the mythic vision of the filmmaker, is what truly drives the film into our collective celluloid immortality.

			The action film is actually a significant staple of our movie fare, and at least half of a major studio’s production schedule is devoted to developing and nurturing this particular brand of entertainment. And now, with the advent of the computer-graphic revolution, it’s only going to become more popular. Writing the action film, or even an action sequence, is really an art unto itself. So many times I read screenplays whose pages are filled with nonstop action—in fact, there is so much action that it becomes dull and repetitive, with little or no characterization. The reader, and the viewer, are overwhelmed and numb. Sometimes, it’s a good action script with strong individual action sequences, but the premise is weak and derivative of earlier films. In other words, we’ve seen it all before. It needs a “new look,” or a more interesting concept. And when that happens, you’re in trouble.

			Why? Because there are problems. Lots of problems. Either with the plot, or the characters, or the action itself. Some writers have a natural ability to write action films, and there are others who are more comfortable writing character, but it’s important to note that before you can write any kind of an action film, or sequence, it’s essential to understand what an action film is, what its nature is. I had a student who wrote a screenplay about a navy pilot sent on a mission to a foreign country to rescue a kidnapped scientist being held hostage. It’s a good premise, and there were several opportunities to create some notable action sequences and keep the story moving forward at a fast pace. So that’s what he did, and his entire screenplay was one action sequence after another; the story moved like lightning, but it didn’t work at all. What he didn’t do was create an interesting main character. Because he didn’t know his main character, most of the dialogue consisted of expository elements designed to keep the story moving forward. It didn’t work. We didn’t know anything about this person sent to rescue the scientist, had no idea about his thoughts or feelings, or about the forces working on his life.

			This is not all that uncommon. When you’re writing an action screenplay, the focus must be on the action and character; the two must reside in and interact with each other. Otherwise there are going to be problems. What usually happens is that the action overpowers the story and diminishes the characters, resulting in a screenplay that, no matter how well written, is flat and uninteresting. There has to be an appropriate balance of peaks and valleys, places in the material where the reader and audience can pause and catch their collective breath.

			So, what do we have to know in order to avoid creating these problems in an action screenplay? Let’s start from the top. Action is defined in the dictionary as “a movement or a series of movements,” or “the state of being in motion,” so film, a medium that moves at twenty-four frames per second, is a natural medium for “showing” action. Writing an action script, or sequence, is a definite skill, and good action scripts are written with color, pacing, suspense, tension, and, in most cases, humor. Remember the Bruce Willis character mumbling to himself in Die Hard (Steven de Souza) or the bus making the leap across the enormous freeway chasm in Speed (Graham Yost)? We remember good action films like Jurassic Park or The Fugitive (David Twohy) or The Hunt for Red October (Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart) by the uniqueness of the action, but we usually forget all the cool car chases and explosions that occupy the majority of action films that fill our theaters. They all look alike.

			The key to writing any action film lies in writing the action sequence. (Plot and character come later.) In an action film like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, for example, the entire film is structured and anchored by six major action sequences. After the introduction of Terminator, the T-1000, and John and Sarah, the first major sequence is where young John Connor is rescued by Terminator; two, Terminator and John break his mother out of prison; three, the “rest period” at Enrique’s gas station where they load up with weapons; four, Sarah’s attempt to kill Miles Dyson, creator of the microchip that makes possible the future Age of Machines; five, the siege at Cyberdyne Systems; and sequence six, their breakout and chase, winding up in the steel factory. The entire Third Act is literally one long nonstop action sequence. These key sequences hold (the function of structure) the entire story together, but within this structural framework Cameron and Wisher have created a dynamic and intriguing premise, as well as some interesting characters. That along with the special effects, is what makes this a truly memorable action film. And let’s not forget that at the Mid-Point, there is the “rest period” at the abandoned gas station so we can “breathe” and learn more about the characters. Then we’re off and running again.

			What is it that makes a good action film great? The electricity of the action sequences. Remember the chase scene from Bullitt? Or “the walk” at the end of The Wild Bunch? Or Butch and Sundance jumping into the river’s gorge after being relentlessly chased by the Super Posse in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? The list goes on and on.

			The key word in writing a great action sequence is the way it’s designed. A sequence, remember, is a series of scenes, connected by one single idea, with a beginning, middle, and end. A sequence is usually a complete entity, held together by one single idea: a chase sequence, wedding sequence, party sequence, fight sequence, love sequence, storm sequence. As mentioned earlier, Twister is a film that is really four major sequences, held together by the characters’ racing from one to the next. And, of course, each new sequence is more intense than the last.

			So let’s take a look at an action sequence. This little tidbit is from Terminator 2: Judgment Day and takes place at the beginning of Act III, right after the Terminator, Sarah, and John, with the help of Miles Dyson, have broken into Cyberdyne Systems to destroy the microchip left behind in The Terminator, seven years earlier. The police are summoned, there’s a huge gunfight action sequence, and, at Plot Point II, they break out of the building and flee with a SWAT team van. They race away, followed by the T-1000, who’s chasing them in a police helicopter. This is the beginning of Act III.

			 				OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS, HERE IT COMES….

				INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY—NIGHT

				Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van onto a divided highway. Sarah and John are catching their breath, still coughing from the CS gas. Terminator looks to the rearview mirror. He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them, gaining.

				Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van. It is a rolling armory. There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment….Then she grabs two M16’s from the wall rack and loads them. She starts on a shotgun as—

				The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed. Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks, which seem to be crawling. The van hits its top speed of eighty. They swerve to miss the back end of a WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEEL TANKER.

				 					The chopper [flown by the T-1000] swings in behind them, closing fast.

				T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine pistol and FIRES. The back of the van CLANGS WITH HITS. The door windows are BLOWN IN.

				Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000’s aim.

				The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.

				One of the doors is kicked open. Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest, crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M16. SHE OPENS FIRE.

				Bullets riddle what’s left of the chopper’s canopy as the T-1000 returns fire. The van is stitched with hits.

				INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls, ripping up the interior. The vests covering John are hit repeatedly. We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her. She pops back out and fires in controlled bursts. The M16 empties and she grabs another.

				Terminator swerves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it and knocking it skidding.

				Sarah reloads and keeps firing. The van swerves around a Toyota. A moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top of the car.

				T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.

				Sarah has popped out to fire. She takes a HIT in the thigh, and several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest. She is blown back onto the floor of the van. She lies there, an exposed target—

				Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.

				He locks up the van’s brakes. Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies. Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.

				And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.

				The rotor disintegrates. The back doors of the van are crushed in as the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK, trapping the T-1000 inside twisted metal. The chopper hits the pavement, flips sideways, and cartwheels…smashing itself into a shapeless mass of twisted metal.

				It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.



			Whew! And, that’s just the beginning of the Third Act. The chase sequence continues on from there, the action building upon itself, the pace quickening, the tension heightening. Just reading this little section, even though it’s taken completely out of context, brings thrills and chills and has me clinging to the edge of my seat.

			If you’re writing an action film, and you feel there’s a problem, determine what it is. Go through the Problem Sheet and see if there’s anything that applies to your specific script. Is the action too dull, or too slow? Does your story move from INTERIOR to INTERIOR to INTERIOR without moving the action to an EXTERIOR location? Are scenes too expository? Are the stakes high enough? Does your character talk about an action that may have happened in the dialogue, and is it possible for you to show the action they’re talking about? This is what happens when you adapt a play into a screenplay. You show what the character is talking about, and that means creating action sequences to keep the story moving forward and reveal information about the main character.

			And you most definitely have to pay attention to the film’s budget. Films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Speed II, Waterworld, Jurassic Park, The Lost World, or Titanic are budgeted at millions and millions of dollars. But they’re also written and directed by people whose previous movies have grossed millions and millions of dollars. Pay attention to the budget. It costs so much to produce a film today, almost $12,000 to $15,000 a minute, that you have to make an effort to keep the production cost under some kind of control, if possible. If you’re fortunate to have a major studio or production company buy your screenplay, great, then let them drive the budget up and add things that will visually enhance your story.

			If your script doesn’t seem to be working as well as it should, or you have some problem areas in terms of pacing, or it seems dull and boring, you might think about adding some kind of action sequence to keep the story moving and the tension taut. Examine the material and see whether the proposed action will blend in with your original concept. Your script is only a start point; sometimes you have to make some drastic creative choices to allow you to fix your film. But always remember that you can’t just throw in an action sequence because your story line drags and sags, or is dull and boring. To approach any action film or sequence, the material has to be designed for and incorporated into your story line and be executed to the best of your ability.

			In today’s market I think it’s essential that every screenwriter should know how to write a good action sequence, no matter what kind of film he or she is working on; whether a character study like Shine (Jan Sardi), or The English Patient, or Lone Star (John Sayles), even a comedy like Michael (Nora Ephron). You’ll find that most of the screenplays funneled through the studio pipeline will have some kind of action sequence woven into the story line. The trick is to make sure it fits into the overall concept and design. I can’t stress this enough.

			There are many problems in screenwriting that can be solved by a knowledge of good action writing, but there is always the tendency to sacrifice character for action. The trick is to weave the two together in such a way that the characters support the action, and the action supports the characters. Crimson Tide, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day are good examples in which the action and characters complement each other.

			In my many travels and workshops I meet a lot of writers who confide in me that they have difficulty crafting an action sequence; when I ask why, their answers, generally, are the same: because film is really “a director’s medium,” they say, anything they do will be ignored anyway. If I probe a little deeper, it turns out that, depending on what their strengths or weaknesses are, it’s because they don’t want to write everything out. As a result they will be the first to admit that their efforts lack focus. Either that or they write such detailed action that it becomes bogged down in a lot of words. The result is usually what I term “thick pages,” pages that are so dense, they’re difficult to read. In the nineties and beyond, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to design the action scene or sequence in the screenplay. You can’t give that responsibility to the director; it’s your job to write the best action you can.

			It wasn’t always that way. In the sixties and seventies a screenwriter could simply write the words There is a chase, and the director would do the rest. One of the most memorable action scenes in the action genre was written that way—the dynamic chase sequence in The French Connection (Ernest Tidyman) stunningly directed by William Friedkin. No longer. Today, action sequences have to be designed and choreographed with the utmost care, skill, and patience.

			So, how do you write a good action sequence?

			William Wisher (Terminator 2, Judge Dredd) says that “ideally, the action is on the page. It’s a very smart thing to do because the script serves different purposes at different times in the [filmmaking] process. The first people who read it are going to be the producers. Your job is to get them to actually see the movie on the page and get them excited enough to write you a big check so that you can make the movie. The second group of people who read your script are directors and actors. Your job with them is to not just get them excited, but to give them a sense of character and structure. There should be enough information to let the actors know how to play their roles and give the director an understanding of how the movie should be made.”

			There’s a fine line to be drawn here, because it’s important not to write too much. David Twohy (The Fugitive, Waterworld, Terminal Velocity) says that “if it gets too detailed, then you’re doing the director’s job and you’re taking things away from him. And he won’t appreciate that. It’s best to give the maximum effect with the minimum amount of words.”

			That means finding the right visual components to describe the sequence. David Koepp, who wrote Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park, and The Lost World, to name a few, says that the key to writing a good action sequence “is finding more ways to say that someone runs. You tend to use a lot of adjectives. For example: He runs to hide behind the rock. He races over to the rock. He scrambles over to the rock. He crawls frantically on his belly over to the rock….Those are the things that drive me crazy. Hurries, trots, sprints, dives, leaps, jumps, barrels, slams. The word slams, that’ll appear a lot in your action script.

			“In an action scene,” Koepp continues, “the reader is sometimes forcing their eyes along because what’s tremendously entertaining to watch on film is not necessarily so thrilling to read. I think the challenge is to make that stuff fly by at the pace you would like it to fly by in the movie. So you’ve constantly got to find ways to make the action sequences readable and easy for the reader to picture in his mind.”

			What’s the best way to write an action sequence?

			Design it, choreograph the action from the beginning, through the middle, and to the end. Choose your words carefully when you’re writing. Action is not written on the page with a lot of long and beautifully styled sentences, the way Tom Clancy does in his novels. Though Clancy builds his cross-cutting scenes with rapid style movements, his intention is to hook his readers so they will move from scene to scene quickly. It’s a very cinematic style. Writing an action sequence has got to be more intense, more visual. As Bill Wisher says, the reader must see the action as if he or she were seeing it on the screen. We’re dealing with moving images that hopefully keep you glued to the edge of your seat, filled with excitement, or fear, or great expectation, locked in that great “community of emotion” that unites everybody in the darkened movie theater. Just look at the great action sequences: Bullitt, The French Connection, Psycho, Terminator 2, the long walk and final shootout from The Wild Bunch. These are all action sequences that have been designed and choreographed with immense care and strict attention to detail.

			Sometimes people tend to write too little, and then the action line becomes thin and doesn’t carry the gripping intensity that you must have in a good action sequence.

			Suppose, for example, your screenplay is slow, it drags and sags, and seems dull and boring. If you reexamine the material, it may be possible to insert some kind of action into the narrative that pumps up the story line. But you must be careful that the action you want to insert belongs in the tone and style of the script. Often the easy way out, a car chase, or a kiss, or a shootout, or a murder attempt, draws attention to itself and therefore will not work.

			And there will be times when the problem will not be in the action, but in how the action is conceived and written. We’ve become so sophisticated, in terms of reading screenplays, that the reader wants some kind of “involvement,” so you want to include the reader in such a way that he or she will be drawn into the action.

			Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) is a master at this. And even then, as in The Long Kiss Goodnight, for example, he overdoes it and somehow the action loses its effectiveness. Cute and clever does not always work. A few pages into the screenplay, Sam, the main character, and her father-in-law, are driving at night. Snow is everywhere. And “that, gentle reader, is when the DEER walks into the road—Fucks up their night altogether.”

			 				 					DEER FACT #25: It’s been said, confronted with roadway deer, that the best course of action is to punch the gas. The idea, presumably, is to pop the animal over the roof, rather than risk dragging him under the car.



			It may work once or twice, but that’s about it. Screenwriters sometimes have the tendency to overwrite their action sequences; that is, they get bogged down in detail, thinking that every piece of “business” needs to be written and explained with absolute minuteness. In that case the pages become “too thick,” and it makes for a very difficult read.

			If the reader ever sees a single-spaced full page or three-quarter page of dramatic action, it becomes a burdensome reading experience. I tell my writers that a good action sequence should be lean, clean, and tight, as well as being totally visual. Each action paragraph should be no longer than four or five sentences. Any more than that and it appears to be a “thick” page. And make sure there’s a lot of white space on the page.

			Here’s an example of an excellent action scene; it’s lean, clean, and tight, totally effective, extremely visual, and not bogged down with details. This is a little piece out of Jurassic Park, by David Koepp. The scene takes place on the island off Costa Rica just as it has been hit by a violent tropical storm, and the security systems have been shut down by an employee trying to smuggle out dinosaur embryos. The two remote-controlled electric cars, one with the two children and the attorney Gennaro, the other with the Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum characters, are stalled next to the massive electric fence that keeps the dinosaurs enclosed in their restricted area. The power is out all over the island, and the kids are scared, nervous.

			 				Tim pulls off the goggles and looks at two clear plastic cups of water that sit in recessed holes on the dashboard. As he watches, the water in the glasses vibrates, making concentric circles—

				then it stops—

				—and then it vibrates again. Rhythmically.

				Like from footsteps.

				BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

				Gennaro’s eyes snap open as he feels it too. He looks up at the rearview mirror.

				There is a security pass hanging from it that is bouncing slightly, swaying from side to side.

				As Gennaro watches, his image bounces too, vibrating in the rearview mirror.

				BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.



			 				GENNARO

				(not entirely convinced)

				M-Maybe it’s the power trying to come back on.



			 				 					Tim jumps into the backseat and puts the night goggles on again. He turns and looks out the side window. He can see the area where the goat is tethered. Or was tethered. The chain is still there, but the goat is gone.

				BANG!

				They all jump, and Lex SCREAMS as something hits the Plexiglas sunroof of the Explorer, hard. They look up.

				It’s a disembodied goat leg.



			 				GENNARO

				Oh, Jesus. Jesus.



			 				Tim whips around to look out the side window again. His mouth pops open, but no sound comes out. Through the goggles he sees an animal claw, a huge one, gripping the cables of the “electrified” fence.

				Tim whips the goggles off and presses forward, against the window. He looks up, up, then cranes his head back farther, to look out the sunroof. Past the goat’s leg, he can see—

				Tyrannosaurus rex. It stands maybe twenty-five feet high, forty feet long from nose to tail, with an enormous, boxlike head that must be five feet long by itself. The remains of the goat are hanging out of the rex’s mouth. It tilts its head back and swallows the animal in one big gulp.



			Well, there it is….Quite impressive. The sequence is the beginning of the action that will carry us through the end of the film. We literally see the action as it unfolds, step by step, bit by bit. Notice how visual it is, and how short the sentences are, almost staccato in their presentation, and how much “white space” is on the page. This is the way a good action sequence should read.

			What do the sequences from Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park have in common? First, the reader and the characters experience the same thing at the same time. We are literally bonded together, “one on one,” so we can experience what the characters are experiencing.

			Take a look at the sequence dynamics: there is a definite beginning, middle, and end to the action. Each visual moment builds the action line, incident to incident.

			We open at the beginning, with the cups on the dashboard vibrating. We know something’s going on here, we just don’t know what.

			Notice how visual it is, then look how the writing of the sequence builds upon the fear and terror of the characters. “BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.” Relentlessly, each sound expands and heightens the moment, stimulating the antennae of our imaginations. The writing style, besides being visual, uses short, clipped words or phrases. No long, beautifully formed sentences here. And of course, Spielberg is a master at putting this kind of sequence on film. Go back and take a look at the opening sequence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

			So far everything still remains unseen, which heightens the fear and causes us to expect the worst. The goat is another visual aid that amplifies the tension and pacing. Generally, a good action sequence builds slowly, setting things up, drawing us into the excitement so the action gets faster and faster. Good pacing allows the tension to build upon itself, no matter whether it’s a chase sequence like Speed, a thriller sequence like Seven, the killing of Harlan in Thelma & Louise, or the tense waiting period for the emergency action message to arrive in Crimson Tide.

			A good action sequence builds image by image, word by word. Notice after the goat has vanished and the chain is swinging freely, suddenly there’s a BANG! and we literally jump in our collective seats. Then, we see the “disembodied goat leg.” That’s when the fear starts rising among the characters, and that’s when our palms begin sweating and our mouths become dry, waiting for and dreading what we know is coming…Tyrannosaurus rex.

			It’s just good writing. Sometimes writers will try to cover a weakness in character writing by inserting action sequences, thus avoiding any attempt at characterization. Sometimes the action sequences are written up in such detail that it looks like there’s a blanket of words on the page, and any attempt to create a good reading experience is simply lost in the excess verbiage.

			Writing a good action film, or a good action sequence, can often create as many problems as it solves. But if you find that your script drags and sags, and needs an extra shot of something, consider some kind of action sequence that can be incorporated into the story line to visually expand the attributes of your character.

			Action and character, joined together, can often sharpen the focus of your screenplay and make it a better reading experience. And that’s what it’s all about.

			Endings


			Endings.

			If there’s one problem that screenwriters have to deal with more than any other, it’s the problem of endings. How to end the screenplay so it works effectively, so it’s satisfying and fulfilling, so it makes an emotional impact on the reader, so it’s not contrived or predictable, so it’s real, believable, not forced or fabricated; an ending that resolves all the main story points; an ending, in short, that works.

			Endings have always fueled the industry dream factory; is there anyone who hasn’t heard about the problems of ending Casablanca (Jules and Philip Stein) or Fatal Attraction (James Deardon)? And what about the endings of White Palace (Alvin Sargent) or The Silence of the Lambs (Ted Tally) or any of the myriad of other films released each year? Stories abound about endings that did not work, or the trials and tribulations of screenwriters and filmmakers trying to achieve the “right” ending.

			What’s so interesting about endings is that, most of the time, the ending is not really the problem, it’s the fact that it doesn’t work effectively. It’s either too soft, or too slow, too wordy or too vague, too expensive or not expensive enough, too down, too up, too contrived, too predictable, or too unbelievable. Sometimes it’s simply not dramatic enough to resolve the story line, or maybe a surprise twist in the story line comes out of nowhere, with no relationship to the story or characters; it just creates a solution to the script, is an easy way to end the story line. This happens a lot with young film students; the easiest way to end the screenplay is by having the main character die, or having everybody die.

			So many times we hear stories about film endings having been changed after audience previews. In many cases the ending of a screenplay is agreed upon, then changed, or sometimes two or three endings will be shot during production, and then a decision will be made in the cutting room, or after audience previews, about which one to use. It happens all the time, and because of the high financial risk factors that go along with making movies, the filmmakers and studios have learned to take their cues from the preview audience, so changing the ending has become part of the moviemaking process.

			Strong endings are an essential part of the screenplay. Whether it’s a drama, comedy, or action thriller, or whatever, doesn’t really matter; what’s important is that the ending be a dynamic conclusion to the story line.

			By itself the ending means the last part, or finish, or the conclusion. The best way to achieve the ending of the screenplay is to let it evolve, or be born, from the resolution of the story. Like a star evolving from the interstellar dust, a good and appropriate ending will always be born from the resolution. That’s the start point, the beginning of a good ending.

			Understanding the basic dynamics of a story’s resolution is essential. By itself resolution means “a solution or explanation; to make clear.” And that process begins at the very start of the screenwriting process. When building or constructing a story line, you must first determine the resolution. What is the resolution of your story? At the initial conception of your screenplay, when you were still working out the idea and shaping it into a dramatic story line, you made a creative choice, a decision, and determined what the resolution was going to be: does your character live or die? Succeed or fail? Successfully escape from Shawshank Prison and make it safely to Mexico? Reenter the earth’s atmosphere and survive the ordeal of the damaged spacecraft as in Apollo 13? Confront her fear of commitment and access her own inner courage and commit to marriage as in How to Make an American Quilt? Does Larry Flynt win the court decision in the legal battle over the First Amendment or not, as in The People vs. Larry Flynt (Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski)? Does the Emergency Action Message arrive in time to prevent the launching of nuclear missiles in Crimson Tide?

			The resolutions of all these films contain the seeds of each particular ending. It’s important to note that resolution and ending are not the same thing. They are connected, in the same way that an ice cube and water are connected, or fire and heat, or the green in a leaf, in terms of their relationship between the parts and the whole. The resolution is a whole, whereas the ending is made up of parts. It is the resolution that contains the seed of the ending, and, if planted and nurtured correctly, it can bloom into a full-fledged dramatic experience. And that’s what we all strive for. Endings are manifested in the resolution, and the resolution is conceived from the beginning. It’s a natural law that endings and beginnings are related; the ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else. Be it a wedding, or a funeral, or a life change like a new job or career, the ending of a relationship or the beginning of a new one, or a move to a new city or country, or whether it’s winning or losing in the lottery, it’s all the same; the end of one thing is always the beginning of something else.

			The surest way for your ending to work is to know the resolution, then find the best way to show the specific scene or sequence so you can make it visually and dramatically effective.

			What happens at the end of your story? If you don’t know (and this ambivalence usually occurs when you’re first evolving your story line), then ask yourself what you would like the ending to be, regardless of whether it’s too simple, too trite, too happy, or too sad. And please don’t get caught up in the game of “What kind of an ending would they like?” Whoever they are. What ending do you want?

			The ending of the screenplay is that point where the entire story line is paid off, so you have to design it carefully from Plot Point II. Seven has a great ending, and that’s what makes the film so disturbing, so you literally carry it with you when you leave the theater. If necessary, retrace your steps from Plot Point II.

			When you reach the Plot Point at the end of the Second Act, what elements are left unresolved? There will be one or two things that need to be resolved in Act III. What are they? Can you define them? In The English Patient the two things left unresolved at the beginning of Act III are whether Almásy comes back in time to save Katherine, seriously injured from the plane crash and waiting for his return in the Cave of the Swimmers; and two, does Caravaggio carry out his mission to kill the English patient as he had planned? The other points to be resolved are what happens to the English patient and to the nurse, Hana.

			These elements must be resolved before you can even think, or construct, the ending. So we follow Almásy as he trudges through the desert looking for help to save Katherine, but drama is conflict, and he’s captured by the English and believed to be a German spy. We see how he escapes, then learn he traded the maps of the desert to the Germans for an airplane. But when he arrives at the Cave of the Swimmers, he’s too late; Katherine has died, but she shares her love and her death with him in the notebook she left behind. He picks her up and carries her in his arms to the airplane and they take off, which, of course, is the opening shot of the movie.

			At that point we cut to present time, where Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) tells the English patient he had intended to kill him, but the dying man replies that he can’t, because he’s “already dead.” At this point his life is over, and Hana (Juliette Binoche) fulfills his wish and gives him an overdose of morphine, so he’s able to leave his body and join his true love. Day breaks, and we follow Hana as she climbs aboard a truck, to begin a new life as a new person, the ghosts of her past buried, and as the truck pulls away, she begins her journey into the light of a new day.

			That ending had to be designed, mapped out. It had to be conceived as emotional, yet symbolic. The same with The Shawshank Redemption. As mentioned, Act III begins with two basic things unresolved: how does Andy escape, and what happens to Red? Act III resolves those two story points; it shows how Andy escapes, and in the process the warden and Hadley are brought to justice. Red is finally paroled, knows he can’t make it on the outside, for he has become institutionalized, and decides to break his parole and join Andy in Mexico. That’s the resolution. The end shows Red walking toward Andy on the sands of the Pacific and their embrace as they are reunited.

			The ending cannot be a separate and isolated incident or event. Everything is connected in a screenplay, everything exists in relationship between the parts and the whole. So, if you feel your ending does not work, if it’s too soft or subtle, or comes out of nowhere, or the main character seems to be lost, or you really don’t know what to do to write an ending that works, then it’s time to sit down at the drawing board and begin the ending from a specific point: Plot Point II.

			First, set up what you have to pay off. Determine what elements of the story must be resolved at the end of the screenplay. If need be, write an essay about what happens in Act III so the story line can be resolved. Then you might want to go through the action and, in free association, in a page-or-two essay, begin to list the ways this film can end. Don’t be attached to any one single shot, scene, or sequence. Just list the various ways the ending can be achieved. If that doesn’t clarify the action, and you’re still unclear about how the material should end, simply write down how you would like it to end, regardless of budget, believability, or anything else that gets in the way. Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas, without any regard as to how to do it. That’s really the first step in the completion process. It’s important to tie together all the loose ends of the narrative line so the screenplay becomes a complete reading experience that rings true and is integral to the action and the characters.

			There are other ways to end your screenplay as well. There may be an instance where Act III becomes an entire sequence, a full and complete unit of action; Apollo 13 is such a case; so is Witness, so is Crimson Tide. And if you look at Pulp Fiction, the end is really the “bookend” ending with the Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer robbery attempt in the restaurant, which, coincidentally, opens the movie. Endings and beginnings are connected, right? In each of these scripts the ending completes the action of Act III.

			In Apollo 13 the entire Third Act focuses on their reentry back to earth, and we follow the action from the moment the LEM separates from the spacecraft, cutting back and forth to the command center, to the anxious three minutes that turns out to be four, waiting for them to plunge through the atmosphere, not knowing whether the heat shield will protect them or not. When they finally do break through the cloud cover and safely land in the ocean and are rescued, that is the resolution; the ending is simply the voice-over of Jim Lovell telling us what happened to the three astronauts after their ordeal in space. It’s played over shots of them on the aircraft carrier.

			The Plot Point at the end of Act II in Witness has John Book (Harrison Ford) and Rachel (Kelly McGillis) completing their relationship as they embrace underneath the birdhouse that Book had broken when he first arrived, and has now restored. Act III opens when the three crooked cops pull over the ridge, park their car, pull out their weapons, and make their way down to the farmhouse. Once there, they break into the farmhouse and hold Rachel and the grandfather hostage while they hunt Book and young Samuel, trying to kill them. So the entire Third Act is really a shootout, and the end comes out of that action; John Book says good-bye to Rachel and young Samuel, and over the end credits, as he drives the car up the long dirt road leading back to Philadelphia, Daniel, played by Alexander Godunov, Rachel’s suitor, walks toward the farmhouse. Witness is a great little film that works on all levels. The ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else.

			It’s different with Crimson Tide. At Plot Point II the emergency action message is interrupted and the Denzel Washington character takes over the command of the sub as the countdown to launch the nuclear missiles continues. Act III is the entire sequence, and ends when they finally receive the complete message telling them to cancel the nuclear strike. That’s the resolution.

			The ending is something else. There is a little tag added on after the action is complete; a naval inquiry is held, and it is decided that both men were right in their actions, because the naval regulations happen to be unclear in this particular situation and must be changed. The Gene Hackman character retires from active duty, the Denzel Washington character will be promoted to captain and receive command of his own ship. When the two men walk outside, the Denzel Washington character tells Gene Hackman that the Lipizzaner horses are really from Spain, not from Portugal, as the Hackman character had claimed, and they’re born black at birth and as they grow into adulthood, they turn white. And, that’s the final comment on the film; the conflict between them was not really a question of right versus wrong, but a question of right versus right. Which is what the entire screenplay is all about. The Lipizzaner is of mixed Arabian, Italian, and Spanish ancestry. The breed was founded in Trieste. Lipizzaner show horses are trained at the Spanish Riding School in Vienna.

			Two different points of view, resolved, effective, complete. It’s what a good ending is meant to do.

			A good ending is only as strong as Act I; in other words, a good ending is set up from the very beginning of the screenplay. It will always come out of the integrity of the story. In many scripts the ending seems predictable; that is, we know what’s going to happen, we just don’t know how. Jerry Maguire (Cameron Crowe) is a script like that. We know from the very beginning what’s going to happen, and the two people are going to get together, but the fun comes in watching how it happens.

			Of course, there are other ways to approach an ending in relationship stories. One of my favorite examples is Michelangelo Antonioni’s classic L’Eclisse (The Eclipse), with Alain Delon and Monica Vitti. In the opening shot two people are sitting silently in a room. The only sound we hear is the whirring of a small fan as it swings back and forth. For almost four minutes nothing is said. That’s because there is nothing left to say, it’s all been said. The curtains are drawn. The silence is loud except for the fan. And we know, by the words not spoken, that the relationship, whatever it might have been, is over. The woman suddenly turns and draws back the curtains, letting in the light of a new day. “Well,” she says, “I’ve got to go.” The man, obviously exhausted, jumps up and says, “Let me drive you.” “No, no…” she replies. He insists. She walks out and he follows her; “Please,” he begs, “let’s have dinner tonight…let’s talk it over.” She doesn’t reply but strides forward with purpose and determination.

			That’s the opening. It’s wonderful, because even though nothing has been said, we understand immediately what has happened; the relationship is over. Film is behavior.

			The Monica Vitti character goes back into her life, and meets Alain Delon, a very attractive and successful stockbroker. They like each other, and begin seeing each other, and as they get closer and spend more time with each other, we like them; they’re attractive, they have many things in common, and we “hope” they can stay together. But as the film progresses, we begin to see things that separate them; he lies to his clients, which she can’t stand, and sometimes he’ll do something dishonest, and then try to justify it to her. She believes in being totally honest, living with integrity, and while we notice her reaction to this part of his personality, nothing is really said. We only see it.

			The end of the film is incredible. There are two scenes very close together. First, they are in his apartment, and he asks if she thinks “we can get along together.” She considers this, hesitating. “I don’t know,” she replies. “There you go again,” he says, “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know….Why do you see me, then?…And don’t tell me you don’t know.” She pauses for a long moment and says, “I wish I didn’t love you…Or that I loved you much more.” He looks at her, not understanding.

			Then, in a continuation of the first scene, we cut to his office, late afternoon. The phones are off the hook. They embrace after they’ve made passionate love, and talk of this and that, when suddenly, the doorbell rings. He freezes, telling her to be silent. He puts on his jacket, as she prepares to leave. He puts the phones back on the hook, and one by one they start ringing. It’s time to go back to work. “See you tomorrow?” he asks. She nods yes. “And the day after, and the day after that…” he says playfully. “And, tonight…” she replies, smiling. “Eight o’clock. Same place,” he says. And they continue to look at each other, the phones ringing incessantly; they embrace passionately, then she turns and walks down the stairs and we follow her outside.

			There follow seven minutes of the most incredibly striking sequence. The two characters we’ve followed for almost the entire film are nowhere to be seen during it, only the places they’ve been together. Shot after shot after shot fill the screen. We see someone who looks like her from behind, but it is not her. We see someone walk out of his building, but it’s not him. Places and faces and objects are focused on, and at the end a bright streetlight fills the frame. The film ends, wrapped in discordant music.

			It’s breathtaking, perhaps the greatest ending I’ve ever seen. We continually expect to see the couple again, and only at the very end do we realize that their relationship was not strong enough for them to stay together. It’s a visually haunting and demanding sequence and derives its power from the opening scene. Both relationships, at the beginning and at the end, have failed to bear fruit for her, and we’re left wondering what it was that she wanted in a relationship and whether it was realistic or idealistic. We’ll never know, for the landscape of love and relationship is always challenging.

			In one way this is an ambiguous ending, and yet it has been totally paid off. We know that she’s a person searching for love, and we understand that she never found it, but because we don’t see the actual ending of the relationship, it lets us make our own decisions as to what really happened. As an ending it works effectively, even though our expectations, however unrealistic, would like to have a more romantic resolution. But the power of that ending is like an eclipse: extraordinary.

			So what makes a good ending? It has to work, first of all, by satisfying the story; so when we reach the final fadeout, or walk out of the movie experience, we want to feel full and satisfied, much as if we were leaving the table after a good meal. It’s this feeling of satisfaction that must be fulfilled in order for the ending to work effectively. And of course, it’s got to be believable. An unsatisfying ending occurred in the thriller Jagged Edge (Joe Eszterhas). The story, about a woman attorney called out of retirement to represent a wealthy publisher accused of murdering his wife (the script opens with the murder), totally believes he is innocent and despite herself falls in love with him. She convinces the jury that he’s innocent and gets him an acquittal. Only then does she begin to suspect that he really is guilty. When she investigates her suspicions, she searches a closet and there finds the critical piece of incriminating evidence. Uh-oh. Too pat, too contrived, too forced, too simple, totally unsatisfying. Doesn’t work.

			The same is true of Presumed Innocent. Taken from Scott Turow’s best seller, and adapted by Frank Pierson and Alan Pakula (who also directed), a well-known prosecutor is assigned to investigate the murder of an attractive assistant prosecutor with whom he’d had an affair. As the evidence piles up, he is charged with the murder, manages to get acquitted, and guess what? Trite and unconvincing.

			If you contrast this with Deceiver (the Pate brothers), Tim Roth portrays a wealthy liar suspected of killing a hooker. Two detectives believe he is guilty, but when he takes the lie detector test, he literally defeats the machine; the two cops know he’s guilty but can’t prove it. After he suddenly, and mysteriously, “dies,” the case is closed; and then, in the last shot, we see Tim Roth approaching another woman, and we know, with chilling certainty, that he has staged his own death in order to beat the rap. This particular ending is more satisfying than the endings of the other two films. It’s a new twist on an old theme.

			In order for an ending to truly work, it has to satisfy the requirement of believability. Absolute Power (William Goldman) is slick and well done, and Clint Eastwood’s direction is marvelous. The story moves along with tense sophistication and ease. Now, this is a case, at least for me, where I admired the film even though it did not engage the “willing suspension of disbelief.” Not for one instant did I believe that the President of the United States, with only three people in the Secret Service, could bring this all about: The opening sequence, the inciting incident, shows a man and woman, drunk, staggering into the bedroom of a large mansion, just as a burglar is cleaning out the vault. The thief can only watch as the sexual encounter turns violent and the woman, defending herself from the man, picks up the letter opener and prepares to stab him. The door bursts open and two Secret Service agents appear and kill the woman.

			When the chief of staff and the two agents discover that the Clint Eastwood character, the burglar, has seen the whole thing, they go after him. Naturally, they find out who he is, but, of course, they must break all laws to kill him. In this case I don’t buy it at all, but what’s so interesting to me is the relationship between the father (Eastwood) and his estranged daughter. This relationship is a significant part of the film, and when the President orders the Secret Service agents to kill Eastwood’s daughter, Plot Point II, the master thief gets really pissed and decides to take on the President. And, in the end, justice is served, and father and daughter are reconciled.

			So, even though I did not “willingly suspend my disbelief,” I bought the ending. It was a fulfilling and satisfying experience.

			What you want to accomplish is the “best” possible ending that works. You want to be true to your story line, and not have to resort to any tricks, gimmicks, or contrived elements, in order to make it work. What’s the best way to do this? First, and I think this goes without saying, you have to be clear on what kind of film you’re writing; then you can begin to devise and execute an appropriate ending.

			So, how would you like it to end? What is the resolution? Then, what do you have to do to achieve it? If the ending doesn’t work the way it is, or how you think it should, feel free to go back and play with it a little. Think about the ending in terms of the reader or viewer’s satisfaction, because the key to a successful ending is the feeling of satisfaction or fulfillment. Whether it’s happy or sad makes no difference. Is the story line resolved? In The English Patient, the ending and the beginning are the same.

			If I could sum up the concept of endings, and declare what is the one most important thing to remember, I would say that the ending comes out of the beginning. Someone, or something, initiates an action, and how that action is resolved becomes the story line of the film.

			So, whatever problem you might have, whether it’s one of Plot, Character, or Structure, know that if you created the problem, then you can solve it. Don’t be afraid to rethink the material, don’t be afraid to rewrite. Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) told me he did twenty-one rewrites on the material, and he was still rewriting in the editing room while they were cutting the film. It’s not how many times you need to rewrite the material, it’s what you need to do in order to make the material the best it can be. That means being able to recognize, define, and then solve whatever problem you might have.

			If there’s one quality I feel is the most essential within the cauldron of Problem Solving, it’s patience. If you become impatient with the material, impatient with yourself, impatient with a lack of progress, impatient with how many times you have to rewrite the same material, impatient with the results, just put your impatience aside and keep to the task at hand. Your job, your responsibility, is to make the material the best it can be, regardless of how long it takes. I know people who write their first draft, dabble a little on some scenes, then send it out into the world. It’s not ready, and it comes back with the results that you would expect. Nobody’s interested, everyone has an idea on how to make it better, and you hit the wall of rejection that is so debilitating it’s possible you’ll put the script on the shelf somewhere and never go back to it.

			There’s another side to this coin. The more people you give your script to read, the more diverse and contradictory the opinions will be about what you have to add, change, or delete in a rewrite. So many times writers give their material to people to read and the opinions and criticisms they receive are so diverse, so contradictory, and alter the story line so much, they don’t even recognize the material anymore. That’s because it’s not their story anymore.

			That happens all the time in the studio system of making movies. The cost of making studio movies has become so exorbitant, costing almost $12,000 to $15,000 per minute, and that, coupled with the cost of prints and advertising and distribution rising at an almost fifteen-percent increase every year, makes the studios hedge their bets. So they appeal to the lowest common denominator; the higher the budget, the more people become involved in adding things to the screenplay. It doesn’t matter whether it’s “right” or not, or whether it “works” or not, studio executives and producers give their input all the time, and their opinions and suggestions are not always right for the material. But because of the money at stake, the ideas are accepted and written into the shooting script. Most of the time the results are a disaster. Look at Waterworld, or Judge Dredd, as two such examples.

			The same happens in writing classes. Everyone in the class is invited to give their opinion about what the writer should do to make the script better, and since everyone has their own opinion, you have a tendency to think that “maybe they’re right,” and you’re “wrong,” because you’re so close to the material you can’t see it anymore. If you think that, if you really buy into that, you’ll very soon succumb to the haze of confusion and uncertainty.

			If you follow everybody’s suggestions, just to follow the suggestions, you’ll find it’s no longer your screenplay. At that point it doesn’t belong to anybody; the changes will be so far removed from what your original intention was that it’s neither your screenplay nor theirs. If their suggestions feel right and you think they’re accurate, use them. But if you know they’re wrong, and what they suggest won’t work for your story, don’t use them. Whatever works, works, and whatever doesn’t, doesn’t, it’s really that simple. At least in theory.

			If you make changes that you don’t feel are right for your screenplay, that’s when it can become a real problem, indeed a nightmare. It never works. The only thing that works, in terms of your material, is whether you feel satisfied with it when you put it out into the world. Deep down inside, when you’re “one on one,” you have to know that you’ve done the best job you can do, at least at this time. Only you can know that with certainty. Only you can trust your own instincts, your own creative Self.

			As I’ve said many times over, everybody’s a writer; everybody has an opinion about how to make your script better, how to sharpen the characters, how to make it more “commercial,” how to be more acceptable to the current temper or trend of the times.

			There will be occasions when someone will make a particular comment or observation that strikes a chord, or a feeling, within you. That’s what you’re looking for, that’s what you have to follow as you walk along the path of Problem Solving; that’s the only map you can follow, that’s the spark of truth and light that illuminates your own creative vision.

			Are you willing to do what has to be done to make your screenplay the best it can be? Are you willing to be true to your own vision? Are you willing to sit down and honor your own inner voice, and mine whatever problems the material might have and turn them into a workable solution? A solution that becomes an opportunity for your own growth and expansion, a solution, whether you know it or not, that will only sharpen your skills as a screenwriter?

			Problem solving is really two sides of the same coin, a process that contains both sacrifice and commitment, for it’s either a challenge or an obligation.

			Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it or you don’t. “The World is as you see it,” reads the ancient scripture. Either you see it as an opportunity, or a burden. Either you honor your own creative vision, or you don’t.

			It’s your choice.

			The Troubleshooter’s Guide


			The Troubleshooter’s Guide is exactly what it says it is; a checklist, or guide, that helps identify and define the “problem,” whatever it may be. Once you’ve gone through the material, and begun to isolate and define the problem as it applies to your screenplay, locate it on the Troubleshooter’s Guide. If you feel there are many problems, go through the guide and checklist the chapters where the solutions might be found. Define them one at a time, whether the problem is one of Plot, Character, or Structure.

			Check what applies:

			 				1. Are you:

				☐ Preparing to write your screenplay?

				☐ Writing the first words on paper draft?

				☐ Rewriting?



			 				2. Is it a problem of:

				☐ PLOT?

				☐ CHARACTER?

				☐ STRUCTURE?



			 				3. Where are you encountering the problem?

				☐ Throughout the screenplay?

				☐ In Act I?

				☐ In the First Half of Act II?

				☐ In the Second Half of Act II?

				☐ In Act III?



			 				4. Where does the problem occur?

IF THE PROBLEM IS IN ACT I, IS IT:

				☐ In the first 10 pages?

				☐ Second 10 pages?

				☐ Plot Point I?

				IF THE PROBLEM IS IN ACT II, WHERE IS IT?

				☐ The First Half of Act II

				☐ Between the end of Plot Point I and Pinch I

				☐ Between Pinch I and the Mid-Point

				☐ The Mid-Point

				☐ Between the Mid-Point and Pinch II

				☐ Between Pinch II and Plot Point II

				☐ As Plot Point II

				IF THE PROBLEM IS IN ACT III, WHERE IS IT?

				☐ What are the one or two points left unresolved at Plot Point II? Define them…just write them out.

				☐ What is the resolution?

				☐ Does the ending work effectively?

				☐ How is it connected to the beginning?
