    <h1>WRITING HEADLINES</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Use numbers</h2>
        <p>There's a reason why so many copywriters use numbers in their headlines. It works.</p>
        <p>Do an experiment: Go to the grocery store, and scan the magazines in the checkout lane. Look at the front-page article headlines.</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter if it's a fitness magazine or a tabloid; many of them will be using numerals to start off the headline.</p>
        <p>There aren't really any rules (as far as I know) regarding what numbers work best, but people typically only remember three to five points. That said, sometimes a really obscure number like 19 or 37 can catch people's attention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Use interesting adjectives</h3>
        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Effortless</li>
            <li>Painstaking</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>Free</li>
            <li>Incredible</li>
            <li>Essential</li>
            <li>Absolute</li>
            <li>Strange</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Use unique rationale</h3>
        <p>If you're going to do a list post, be original. For example consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reasons</li>
            <li>Principles</li>
            <li>Facts</li>
            <li>Lessons</li>
            <li>Ideas</li>
            <li>Ways</li>
            <li>Secrets</li>
            <li>Tricks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If possible, never use things. Please, for the love of Pete, don't use things. You can do better than that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Use what, why, how, or when</h2>
        <p>These are trigger words. I typically use "why" and "how" the most, because I'm often trying to persuade or enable someone.</p>
        <p>Typically, you'll use either a trigger word or a number. Rarely does it sound good to do both.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Make an audacious promise</h2>
        <p>Promise your reader something valuable.</p>
        <p>Will you teach her how to learn a new skill? Will you persuade her to do something she's never done before? Will you unlock an ancient mystery?</p>
        <p>What you want to do is dare your reader to read the article. Without over-promising, be bold. Be seductive (in the most innocuous way possible, of course). Be dangerous.</p>
        <p>And then deliver what you promised.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Try this formula</h2>
        <p>Here's a simple headline-writing formula: Number or Trigger word + Adjective + Keyword + Promise</p>
        <p>Example: Take the subject "bathing elephants." You could write an article entitled, "How to Bath an Elephant" or "Why I Love Bathing Elephants."</p>
        <p>Or you could apply this formula and make it: "18 Unbelievable Ways You Can Bathe an Elephant Indoors"</p>
        <p>Another (more serious) example: Take a bold promise like "selling your house in a day."</p>
        <p>Apply the formula and you get: "How You Can Effortlessly Sell Your Home in Less than 24 Hours"</p>
    </div>
