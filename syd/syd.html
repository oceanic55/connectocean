<h1 class="chap_head" id="calibre_link-243"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-244">Intro</span></i></h1>
<div class="block">
</div>
<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-248">In 1979, when I first wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-249">Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-250">, there were only a few books on the market that dealt with the art and craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-251">The most popular was Lagos Egri’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-252">The Art of Dramatic Writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-253">, first published in the 1940s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-254">Though it was not really a book about screenwriting, but playwriting, the principles laid out were precise and clear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-255">At that time, there was no real distinction made between the crafts of writing for the stage and writing for the screen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-256">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-257"> changed all that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-258">It laid out the principles of dramatic structure to establish the foundations of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-259">It was also the first book to use well-known and popular movies of the time to illustrate the craft of writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-260">And, as we all know, screenwriting is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-261">When it was first published, it became an immediate best seller, or “an instant sensation,” as my publisher labeled it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-262">Within the first few months of publication it went through several printings and became a “hot” topic of discussion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-263">Everyone, it seemed, was surprised by its meteoric success.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-264">Except me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-265">During my teaching and lecturing on screenwriting in the 1970s at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood, I saw people from all walks of life burning with an incredible desire to write screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-266">Hundreds of people flowed thorough my course on screenwriting, and it soon became clear that everyone had a story to tell. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-267">They just didn’t know how to tell it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-268">Since that day in the early spring of 1979 when </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-269">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-270"> first arrived on bookstore shelves, there has been a tremendous upsurge in the evolution of writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-271">Today, the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking is an integral part of our culture and cannot be ignored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-272">Walk into any bookstore and you’ll see shelves and shelves devoted to all aspects of filmmaking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-273">In fact, the two most popular majors on college campuses are business and film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-274">And with the dramatic rise of computer technology and computer graphic imagery, the expanded influence of MTV, reality TV, Xbox, PlayStation, and new wireless LAN technology, and the enormous increase in film festivals both here and abroad, we’re in the middle of a cinematic revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-275">It won’t be too long before we make a short film on our telephones, e-mail them to our friends, and project them on our TV. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-276">Clearly, we have evolved in the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-277">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-278"> things.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-279">Take a look at the epic adventure </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-280">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-281"> (all three parts), or the portrait of the modern family illustrated in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-282">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-283">, or the emotional and visual impact of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-284">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-285">, or the literary presentations of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-286">The Bourne Supremacy, Cold Mountain, Memento, Rushmore, Magnolia, The Royal Tenenbaums</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-287">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-288">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-289">, compare them to any films of the ’70s or ’80s, and you’ll see the distinctions of this revolution: the images are fast; the information conveyed is visual, rapid; the use of silence is exaggerated; and the special effects and music are heightened and more pronounced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-290">The concept of time is often more subjective and nonlinear, more novelistic in tone and execution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-291">Yet, while the tools and technique of storytelling have evolved and progressed based on the needs and technologies of the time, the art of storytelling has remained the same.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-292">Movies are a combination of art and science; the technological revolution has literally changed the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-293">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-294"> movies and therefore, by necessity, has changed the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-295">write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-296"> movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-297">But no matter what changes are made in the execution of the material, the nature of the screenplay is the same as it has always been: A screenplay is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-298">a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-299">placed within the context of dramatic structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-300">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-301">That’s what it is; that is its nature. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-302">It is the art of visual storytelling.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-303">The craft of screenwriting is a creative process that can be learned. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-304">To tell a story, you have to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-305">set up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-306"> your characters, introduce the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-307">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-308"> (what the story is about) and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-309">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-310"> (the circumstances surrounding the action), create obstacles for your characters to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-311">confront</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-312"> and overcome, then </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-313">resolve</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-314"> the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-315">You know, boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-316">All stories, from Aristotle through all the constellations of civilization, embody the same dramatic principles.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-317">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-318">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-319">, Frodo becomes the ring bearer to return the ring to its place of origin, Mount Doom, so he can destroy it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-320">That is his dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-321">How he gets there and completes the task is the story. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-322">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-323"> sets up the characters and situation and narrative through line; it establishes Frodo and the Shire, as well as the Fellowship, who set off on their mission to Mount Doom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-324">Part II, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-325">The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-326">, dramatizes the obstacles Frodo, Sam, and the Fellowship confront on their journey to destroy the ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-327">They are confronted with obstacle after obstacle that hinder their mission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-328">At the same time, Aragorn and the others must overcome many challenges to defeat the Orcs at Helms Deep. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-329">And Part III, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-330">The Return of the King</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-331">, resolves the story: Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom and watch as the ring and the Gollum fall into the fires and are destroyed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-332">Aragorn is crowned king, and the hobbits return to the Shire and their life plays out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-333">Set-up, confrontation, and resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-334">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-335">It is the stuff of drama. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-336">I learned this when I was a kid sitting in a darkened theater, popcorn in hand, gazing in awe and wonder at the images projected on the white river of light reflected on that monster screen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-337">A native of Los Angeles (my grandfather arrived here from Poland in 1907), I grew up surrounded by the film industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-338">When I was about ten, as a member of the Sheriff’s Boys’ Band, I was cast in Frank Capra’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-339">The State of the Union</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-340">, starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-341">I don’t remember much about the experience except that Van Johnson taught me how to play checkers.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-342">On Saturday afternoons, my friends and I used to sneak into the neighborhood theater and watch the serials of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-343">Flash Gordon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-344"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-345">Buck Rogers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-346">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-347">During my teens, going to the movies became a passion, a form of entertainment, a distraction, and a topic of discussion, as well as a place to make out and have fun. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-348">Occasionally, there would be unforgettable moments—like watching Bogart and Bacall in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-349">To Have and Have Not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-350">, or Walter Huston’s mad dance as he discovered gold in the mountains in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-351">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-352">, or watching Brando stagger up the gangplank at the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-353">On the Waterfront</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-354">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-355">I attended Hollywood High School and was invited to join the Athenians, one of the many clubs whose members hung out together during high school. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-356">A short time after graduation, one of my best friends, Frank Mazzola, also a member of the Athenians, met James Dean and formed a strong relationship with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-357">Frank introduced Dean to what a high school “club” was like during this period (by today’s standards it would probably be referred to as a gang). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-358">Director Nicholas Ray and James Dean chose Frank to be the “gang” consultant in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-359">Rebel Without a Cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-360"> and to play the part of Crunch in the movie, so the Athenians became the model of the club/gang in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-361">Rebel Without a Cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-362">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-363">Occasionally Dean would come with us when we strolled down Hollywood Boulevard on a Saturday night looking for trouble. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-364">We were the so-called tough kids, never backing down from anything, whether it was a dare or a fight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-365">We managed to get into a lot of trouble.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-366">Dean loved hearing about our “adventures” and would continually pump us for details. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-367">When we pulled some wild stunt, whatever it was, he wanted to know how it started, what we were thinking, how it felt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-368">Actors’ questions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-369">It was only after </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-370">Rebel Without a Cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-371"> was released and stormed the world that I became aware of how significant our contribution to the movie had been. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-372">The irony of Dean’s having hung out with us during that period had no real effect on me until after he died; only then, when he became an icon of our generation, did I begin to grasp the significance of what we had contributed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-373">It was Mazzola who convinced me to take an acting class, which ultimately transformed my life; it was one of those moments that impact a series of other moments and led me to the path I’m still following to this day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-374">My family—aunts and uncles (my parents had died several years earlier)—wanted me to be a “professional person,” meaning a doctor, lawyer, or dentist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-375">I had been working part-time at Mount Sinai Hospital and I liked the drama and pace of emergency room medicine, so I entertained thoughts about becoming a doctor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-376">I enrolled at the University of California, packed up the few belongings I had, and drove to Berkeley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-377">It was August 1959.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-383">It didn’t take long for me to be swept up in the activities personifying the fervid issues of the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-384">Like so many others of my generation, I was influenced and inspired by the “beats”—Kerouac, Ginsberg, Gregory Corso: the poet/saints who were blazing a trail of rebellion and revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-385">Inspired by their voices and their lives, I, too, wanted to ride the waves of change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-386">It wasn’t too long before the campus exploded into a political frenzy initiated by Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-393">My relationship with Renoir literally changed my life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-394">I’ve learned there are two or three times during a lifetime when something happens that alters the course of that life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-395">We meet someone, go somewhere, or do something we’ve never done before, and those moments are the possibilities that guide us to where we’re supposed to go and what we’re supposed to do with our lives.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-396">People say I was extremely fortunate to be working with Renoir, that it was a chance and fortuitous accident of being in the right place at the right time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-397">That’s true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-398">But over the years, I’ve learned not to believe too much in luck or accidents; I think everything happens for a reason. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-399">There’s something to be learned from every moment, every experience we encounter during the brief time we spend on this planet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-400">Call it fate, call it destiny, call it what you will; it really doesn’t matter.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-401">I auditioned for the world premiere of Renoir’s play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-402">Carola</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-403">, and was cast in the third lead, playing the part of Campan, the stage manager of a theater in Paris during the Nazi occupation in the last days of World War II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-404">For almost a year, I sat at Renoir’s feet, watching and learning about movies through his eyes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-405">He was always commenting on film, his opinions vocal and fervent about everything he saw or wrote, either as an artist, a person, or a humanitarian. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-406">And he was all of these. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-407">Being in his presence was an inspiration, a major life lesson, a joy, a privilege, as well as a great learning experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-408">Though movies had always been a major part of my life, it was only during the time I spent with Renoir that I turned my focus to film, the same way a plant turns toward the sun. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-409">Suddenly, I saw movies in a whole new light, as an art form to study and learn, seeking in the story and images an expression and understanding of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-410">My love for the movies has fed and nourished me ever since.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-411">“Qu’est-ce que le cinéma?”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-412"> is the question Renoir always used to ask before he showed us one of his films. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-413">“What is film?”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-414"> He used to say movies are more than mere flashing images on the screen: “They are an art form that becomes larger than life.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-415">What can I say about Jean Renoir? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-416">He was a man like any other, but what separated him, at least in my mind, was his great heart; he was open, friendly, a man of great intelligence, wisdom, and wit who seemed to influence the lives of everyone he touched. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-417">The son of the great Impressionistic painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean, too, had the great gift of sight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-418">Renoir taught me about film, mentored me in the art of visually telling a story, and imparted the gift of insight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-419">He showed me the door, then held it open as I walked through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-420">I’ve never looked back.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-421">Renoir hated the cliché. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-422">He would quote his father about bringing an idea into existence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-423">“If you paint the leaf on a tree without using a model,” Renoir told us the great Impressionistic painter once said, “your imagination will only supply you with a few leaves; but Nature offers you millions, all on the same tree. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-424">No two leaves are exactly the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-425">The artist who paints only what is in his mind must very soon repeat himself.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-426">If you look at Renoir’s great paintings, you’ll see what he meant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-427">No two leaves, no two flowers, no two people are ever painted in the same way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-428">It’s the same with his son’s films: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-429">Grand Illusion, Rules of the Game</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-430"> (considered two of the greatest films ever made), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-431">The Golden Coach, Picnic on the Grass</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-432">, and many more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-433">Renoir told me he “painted with light,” the same way his father painted with oils. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-434">Jean Renoir was an artist who discovered the cinema in the same way his father “discovered” Impressionism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-435">“Art,” he said, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-451">For the past few decades, as I’ve traveled and lectured around the world on the art and craft of screenwriting, I have watched the style of screenwriting evolve into a more visual medium. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-452">As I mentioned, we’re seeing certain techniques of the novel, like stream of consciousness and chapter headings, beginning to seep into the modern screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-453">(</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-454">Kill Bill I</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-455"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-456">II, The Hours, The Royal Tenenbaums, American Beauty, The Bourne Supremacy, The Manchurian Candidate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-457">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-458">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-459"> are just a few examples.) It’s clear that a whole new computer-savvy generation, who grew up with interactive software, digital storytelling, and editing applications sees things in a more visual way and is thus able to express it in a more cinematic style.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-460">But when all is said and done, the principles of screenwriting don’t change; they are the same no matter in what time or place or era we live. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-461">Great films are timeless—they embody and capture the times in which they were made; the human condition is the same now as it was then.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-462">My purpose in writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-463">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-464"> was to explore the craft of screenwriting and illustrate the foundations of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-465">When you want to write a screenplay, there are two aspects you have to deal with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-466">One is the preparation required to write it: the research, thinking time, character work, and laying out of the structural dynamic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-467">The other is the execution, the actual writing of it, laying out the visual images and capturing the dialogue. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-468">The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-469">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-470">That was true when I first wrote the book, and it is now.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-471">This is not a “how-to” book; I can’t teach anybody </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-472">how to write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-473"> a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-474">People teach themselves the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-475">All I can do is show them </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-476">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-477"> they have to do to write a successful screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-478">So, I call this a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-479">what-to</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-480"> book, meaning if you have an idea for a screenplay, and you don’t know what to do or how to do it, I can show you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-481">As a writer-producer for David L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-482">Wolper Productions, a freelance screenwriter, and head of the story department at Cinemobile Systems, I have spent years writing and reading screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-483">At Cinemobile alone, I read and synopsized more than two thousand screenplays in a little over two years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-484">And of all those two thousand screenplays, I only found forty to submit to our financial partners for possible film production.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-485">Why so few? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-486">Because ninety-nine out of a hundred screenplays I read weren’t good enough to invest millions of dollars in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-487">Put another way, only one out of a hundred screenplays I read was good enough to consider for film production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-488">And at Cinemobile, our job was making movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-489">In one year alone, we were directly involved in the production of some 119 motion pictures, ranging from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-490">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-491"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-492">Jeremiah Johnson</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-493"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-494">Deliverance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-495"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-496">Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-497"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-498">American Graffiti</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-499">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-500">At that time, in the early ’70s, Cinemobile was a portable location facility that literally revolutionized film production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-501">Filmmakers no longer had to rely on a supply caravan to carry cast, crew, and equipment to whatever location they were using. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-502">Basically, the Cinemobile was a Greyhound bus with an eight-wheel-drive, so we could store equipment in the luggage area, then transport cast and crew to the top of a mountain, shoot three to eight pages of script each day, and return home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-503">My boss, Fouad Said, the creator of the Cinemobile, became so successful that he decided to make his own movies, so he went out and raised several million dollars in a few weeks, with a revolving fund of many million more, if needed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-504">Pretty soon everybody in Hollywood was sending him screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-505">Thousands of scripts came in, from stars and directors, from studios and producers, from the known and the unknown.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-506">That’s when I was given the opportunity to read the submitted screenplays and evaluate them in terms of cost, quality, and probable budget. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-507">My job, as I was constantly reminded, was to “find material” for our three financial partners: the United Artists Theatre Group; the Hemdale Film Distribution Company, headquartered in London; and the Taft Broadcasting Company, parent company of Cinemobile.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-508">So I began reading screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-509">As a screenwriter taking a much-needed break from more than seven years of freelance writing (I had written nine screenplays: two were produced, four were optioned, and three nothing ever happened with), my job at Cinemobile gave me a totally new perspective on writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-510">It was a tremendous opportunity, a formidable challenge, and a dynamic learning experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-511">I kept asking myself what made the screenplays I recommended better than the others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-512">At first I didn’t have any answers, but I held it in my consciousness and thought about it a long time.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-513">Every morning, when I arrived at work, there would be a stack of screenplays on my desk, waiting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-514">No matter what I did, no matter how fast I read or how many scripts I skimmed, skipped, or tossed, one solid fact always remained: The size of the pile never changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-515">I knew I could never get through the pile.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-516">Reading a screenplay is a unique experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-517">It’s not like reading a novel, play, or article in the Sunday paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-518">When I first started reading, I read the words on the page slowly, drinking in all the visual descriptions, character nuances, and dramatic situations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-519">But that didn’t work for me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-520">I found it too easy to get caught up in the writer’s words and style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-521">I learned that most of the scripts that read well—meaning they featured lovely sentences, stylish and literate prose, and beautiful dialogue—usually didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-522">While they might read like liquid honey flowing across the page, the overall feeling was that of reading a short story or a strong journalistic piece in a magazine like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-523">Vanity Fair</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-524"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-525">Esquire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-526">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-527">But that’s not what makes a good screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-528">I started out wanting to read and “do coverage” on—synopsize—three screenplays a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-529">I found I could read two scripts without a problem, but when I got to the third, the words, characters, and actions all seemed to congeal into some kind of amorphous goo of plotlines concerning the FBI and CIA, punctuated with bank heists, murders, and car chases, with a lot of wet kisses and naked flesh thrown in for local color. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-530">At two or three in the afternoon, after a heavy lunch and maybe a little too much wine, it was difficult to keep my attention focused on the action or nuances of character and story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-531">So, after a few months on the job, I usually found myself closing my office door, propping my feet up on the desk, turning off the phones, leaning back in the chair with a script on my chest, and taking a catnap.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-532">I must have read more than a hundred screenplays before I realized that I didn’t know what I was doing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-533">What was I looking for? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-534">What made a screenplay good or bad? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-535">I could tell whether I liked it or not, yes, but what were the elements that made it a good screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-536">It had to be more than a string of clever bits and smart dialogue laced together in a series of beautiful pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-537">Was it the plot, the characters, or the visual arena where the action took place that made it a good screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-538">Was it the visual style of writing or the cleverness of the dialogue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-539">If I didn’t know the answers to that, then how could I answer the question I was repeatedly being asked by agents, writers, producers, and directors: What was I looking for? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-540">That’s when I understood that the real question for me was, How do I read a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-541">I knew how to write a screenplay, and I certainly knew what I liked or disliked when I went to the movies, but how did I apply that to the reading of a screenplay?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-542">The more I thought about it, the clearer I became. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-543">What I was looking for, I soon realized, was a style that exploded off the page, exhibiting the kind of raw energy found in scripts like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-544">Chinatown, Taxi Driver, The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-545">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-546">American Graffiti</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-547">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-548">As the stack of scripts on my desk grew higher and higher, I felt very much like Jay Gatsby at the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-549">The Great Gatsby</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-550">, F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-551">Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-552">At the end of the book, Nick, the narrator, recalls how Gatsby used to stand looking out over the water at the image of the green light, beckoning him to past memories of unrequited love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-553">Gatsby was a man who believed in the past, a man who believed that if he had enough wealth and power, he could turn back time and re-create it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-554">It was that dream that spurred him as a young man to cross over the tracks, searching for love and wealth, searching for the expectations and desires of the past that he hoped would become the future.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-555">The green light.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-556">I thought a lot about Gatsby and the green light as I struggled through those piles of screenplays searching for “the good read,” that special and unique screenplay that would be “the one” to make it through the gauntlet of studios, executives, stars, financial wizards, and egos and finally end up on that monster screen in a darkened theater.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-557">It was just about that time that I was given the opportunity to teach a screenwriting class at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-558">At that time in the ’70s, Sherwood Oaks was a professional school taught by professionals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-559">It was the kind of school where Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, and Lucille Ball gave acting seminars; where Tony Bill taught a producing seminar; where Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, and Alan Pakula gave directing seminars; where John Alonzo and Vilmos Zsigmond, two of the finest cinematographers in the world, taught classes in cinematography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-560">It was a school where producers, professional production managers, cameramen, film editors, writers, directors, and script supervisors all came to teach their craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-561">It was the most unique film school in the country.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-563">What is a good screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-564">I kept asking myself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-565">And pretty soon I started getting some answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-566">When you read a good screenplay, you know it—it’s evident from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-567">The style, the way the words are laid out on the page, the way the story is set up, the grasp of dramatic situation, the introduction of the main character, the basic premise or problem of the screenplay—it’s all set up in the first few pages of the script: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-568">Chinatown, Five Easy Pieces, The Godfather, The French Connection, Shampoo</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-569">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-570">All the President’s Men</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-571"> are all perfect examples.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-572">A screenplay, I soon realized, is a story told with pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-573">It’s like a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-574">noun;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-575"> it has a subject, and is usually about a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-576">person</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-577">, or persons, in a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-578">place</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-579">, or places, doing his, or her, or their </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-580">“thing.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-581"> The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-582">person</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-583"> is the main character and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-584">doing his/her thing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-585"> is the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-586">Out of that understanding, I saw that any good screenplay has certain conceptual components common to the screenplay form.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-587">These elements are expressed dramatically within a structure that has a definite beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-588">When I reexamined the forty screenplays submitted to our financial partners—including </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-589">The Godfather, American Graffiti, The Wind and the Lion, Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-590">, and others—I realized they all contained these basic concepts, regardless of how they were cinematically executed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-591">I began teaching this conceptual approach to writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-592">If the aspiring writer knows what a screenplay is, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-593">what it looks like</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-594">, I reasoned, it can be used as a guide or blueprint to point out the path through the forest.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-595">I’ve now been teaching this approach to screenwriting for over twenty-five years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-596">It’s an effective and comprehensive approach to the writing of a screenplay and the art of visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-597">My material has evolved and been applied by thousands and thousands of students all over the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-598">The principles in this book have been totally embraced by the film industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-599">It’s not uncommon for major film studios and production companies to contractually stipulate that a delivered screenplay must have a definite three-act structure and be no longer than 2 hours and 8 minutes, or 128 pages, in length. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-600">(There are always exceptions, of course.)</span></p>

</div>
<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-668">In the summer of 1937, F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-669">Scott Fitzgerald, drinking far too much, deeply in debt, and drowning in the suffocating well of despair, moved to Hollywood seeking new beginnings, hoping to reinvent himself by writing for the movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-670">The author of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-671">The Great Gatsby, Tender Is the Night, This Side of Paradise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-672">, and the uncompleted </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-673">The Last Tycoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-674">, perhaps America’s greatest novelist, was, as one friend put it, seeking redemption.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-675">During the two and a half years he spent in Hollywood, he took the craft of screenwriting “very seriously,” says one noted Fitzgerald authority: “It’s heartbreaking to see how much effort he put into it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-676">Fitzgerald approached every screenplay as if it were a novel and often wrote long backstories for each of the main characters before putting one word of dialogue down on paper.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-677">Despite all the preparation he put into each assignment, he was obsessed with finding the answer to a question that haunted him continuously: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-678">What makes a good screenplay?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-679"> Billy Wilder once compared Fitzgerald to “a great sculptor who is hired to do a plumbing job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-680">He did not know how to connect the pipes so the water could flow.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-681">Throughout his Hollywood years, he was always trying to find the “balance” between the words spoken and the pictures seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-682">During this time, he received only one screen credit, adapting the novel </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-683">Three Comrades</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-684"> by Erich Maria Remarque (starring Robert Taylor and Margaret Sullavan), but Joseph L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-685">Mankiewicz eventually rewrote his script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-686">He worked on rewrites for several other movies, including a disastrous week on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-687">Gone With the Wind</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-688"> (he was forbidden to use any words that did not appear in Margaret Mitchell’s novel), but after </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-689">Three Comrades</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-690">, all of his projects ended in failure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-691">One, a script for Joan Crawford called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-692">Infidelity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-693">, was left uncompleted, canceled because it dealt with the theme of adultery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-694">Fitzgerald died in 1941, working on his last, unfinished novel, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-695">The Last Tycoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-696">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-697">He died believing himself to be a failure.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-698">I’ve always been intrigued by the journey of F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-699">Scott Fitzgerald. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-700">What resonates with me the most is that he was constantly searching for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-701">the answer</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-702"> to what made a good screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-703">His overwhelming external circumstances—his wife Zelda’s insti­tutio­naliz­ation, his unmanageable debts and lifestyle, his excessive drinking—all fed into his insecurities about the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-704">And make no mistake: Screenwriting is a craft, a craft that can be learned. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-705">Even though he worked excessively hard, and was disciplined and responsible, he failed to achieve the results he was so desperately striving for.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-706">Why?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-707">I don’t think there’s any one answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-708">But reading his books and writings and letters from this period, it seems clear that he was never exactly sure what a screenplay </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-709">was;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-710"> he always wondered whether he was “doing it right,” whether there were certain rules he had to follow in order to write a successful screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-711">When I was studying at the University of California, Berkeley, as an English lit major, I read the first and second editions of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-712">Tender Is the Night</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-713"> for one of my classes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-714">It is the story of a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients, who, as she slowly recovers, exhausts his vitality until he is “a man used up.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-715">The book, the last one Fitzgerald completed, was considered technically faulty and was commercially unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-716">In the first edition of the novel, Book I is written from the point of view of Rosemary Hoyt, a young actress who shares her observations about meeting the circle that surrounds Dick and Nicole Diver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-717">Rosemary is on the beach at Cap d’Antibes on the French Riviera, watching the Divers enjoying an outing on the sand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-718">As she watches, she sees them as a beautiful couple who appear, at least from her point of view, to have everything going for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-719">They are, she thinks, the ideal couple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-720">Rich, beautiful, intelligent, they look to be the embodiment of what everyone wants for himself or herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-721">But the second book of the novel focuses on the life of Dick and Nicole, and we learn that what we saw through Rosemary’s eyes was only the relationship they showed to the world; it was not really true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-722">The Divers have major problems, which drain them emotionally and spiritually, and ultimately destroy them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-723">When the first edition of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-724">Tender Is the Night</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-725"> was published, sales were poor, and Fitzgerald thought he had probably been drinking too much and might have compromised his vision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-726">But from his Hollywood experience, he came to believe he did not introduce his main characters early enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-727">“Its great fault,” Fitzgerald wrote of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-728">Tender Is the Night</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-729"> to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, “is that the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-730">true</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-731"> beginning—the young psychiatrist in Switzerland—is tucked away in the middle of the book.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-732">He decided that when the second edition was printed, he would interchange the first section with the second and open the novel with Dick Diver in wartime Switzerland in order to explain the mystery about the Divers’ courtship and marriage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-733">So he opened the book focusing on the main character, Dick Diver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-734">But that didn’t work either, and Fitzgerald was crushed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-735">The book was financially unsuccessful until many years later, when Fitzgerald’s genius was finally acknowledged.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-736">What strikes me so vividly is what Fitzgerald </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-737">didn’t</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-738"> see; his opening section focusing on how Rosemary saw the Divers was more cinematic than novelistic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-739">It’s a great cinematic opening, setting up the characters as others see them, like an establishing shot; in this first edition, Fitzgerald was </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-740">showing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-741"> us how this model couple looked to the world, beautiful and rich, seeming to have everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-742">How we look to the outside world, of course, is a lot different from who we really are behind closed doors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-743">My personal feeling is that it was Fitzgerald’s insecurity about the craft of screenwriting that drove him to change that great opening.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-744">F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-745">Scott Fitzgerald was an artist literally caught between two worlds, caught between his genius as a writer and his self-doubt and inability to express that genius in screenplay form.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-746">Screenwriting is a definite craft, a definite art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-747">Over the years, I’ve read thousands upon thousands of screenplays, and I always look for certain things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-748">First, how does it look on the page? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-749">Is there plenty of white space, or are the paragraphs dense, too thick, the dialogue too long? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-750">Or is the reverse true: Is the scene description too thin, the dialogue too sparse? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-751">And this is before I read one word; this is just what it “looks” like on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-752">You’d be surprised how many decisions are made in Hollywood by the way a screenplay looks—you can tell whether it’s been written by a professional or by someone who’s still aspiring to be a professional.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-753">Everybody is writing screenplays, from the waiter at your favorite bar or restaurant to the limo driver, the doctor, the lawyer, or the barista serving up the White Chocolate Dream Latte at the local Coffee Bean. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-754">Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East, and out of that number maybe four or five hundred scripts were actually produced.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-755">What makes one screenplay better than another? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-756">There are many answers, of course, because each screenplay is unique. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-757">But if you want to sit down and spend six months to a year writing a screenplay, you first have to know what a screenplay </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-758">is—what its nature is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-759">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-760">What is a screenplay?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-761"> Is it a guide, or an outline, for a movie? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-762">A blueprint, or a diagram? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-763">Or maybe it’s a series of images, scenes, and sequences strung together with dialogue and description, like pearls on a strand? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-764">Perhaps it’s simply the landscape of a dream?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-765">Well, for one thing, a screenplay is not a novel, and it’s most certainly not a play. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-766">If you look at a novel and try to define its fundamental nature, you’ll see that the dramatic action, the story line, usually takes place inside the head of the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-767">We see the story line unfold through the eyes of the character, through his/her point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-768">We are privy to the character’s thoughts, feelings, emotions, words, actions, memories, dreams, hopes, ambitions, opinions, and more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-769">The character and reader go through the action together, sharing in the drama and emotion of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-770">We know how they act, feel, react, and figure things out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-771">If other characters appear and are brought into the narrative line of action, then the story embraces their point of view, but the main thrust of the story line always returns to the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-772">The main character is who the story is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-773">In a novel the action takes place inside the character’s head, within the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-774">mindscape</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-775"> of dramatic action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-776">A play is different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-777">The action, or story line, occurs onstage, under the proscenium arch, and the audience becomes the fourth wall, eavesdropping on the lives of the characters, what they think and feel and say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-778">They talk about their hopes and dreams, past and future plans, discuss their needs and desires, fears and conflicts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-779">In this case, the action of the play occurs within the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-780">language</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-781"> of dramatic action; it is spoken in words that describe feelings, actions, and emotions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-782">A screenplay is different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-783">Movies are different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-784">Film is a visual medium that dramatizes a basic story line; it deals in pictures, images, bits and pieces of film: We </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-785">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-786"> a clock ticking, a window opening, a person in the distance leaning over a balcony, smoking; in the background we hear a phone ringing, a baby crying, a dog barking as we see two people laughing as their car pulls away from the curb. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-787">“Just making pictures.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-788">The nature of the screenplay deals in pictures, and if we wanted to define it, we could say that a screenplay is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-789">a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-790">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-791">That is its essential nature, just like a rock is hard and water’s wet.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-792">Because a screenplay is a story told with pictures, we can ask ourselves, what do all stories have in common? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-793">They have a beginning, middle, and an end, not necessarily in that order, as Jean-Luc Godard says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-794">Screenplays have a basic linear structure that creates the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-795">form</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-796"> of the screenplay because it holds all the individual elements, or pieces, of the story line in place.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-797">To understand the principle of structure, it’s important to start with the word itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-798">The root of structure, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-799">struct</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-800">, has two definitions that are relevant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-801">The first definition means “to build” or “to put something together,” like a building or car. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-802">The second definition is “the relationship between the parts and the whole.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-803">The parts and the whole. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-804">This is an important distinction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-805">What is the relationship between the parts and the whole? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-806">How do you separate one from the other? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-807">If you take the game of chess, for example, the game itself is a whole composed of four parts: (1) </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-808">the pieces</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-809">—the queen, king, bishop, pawns, knights, etc.; (2) </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-810">the player(s)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-811">, because someone has to play the game of chess, either against another person or a computer; (3) </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-812">the board</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-813">, because you can’t play chess without a board, and (4) </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-814">the rules</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-815">, because you can’t play a chess game unless you play by the rules. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-816">Those four parts—the pieces, the player(s), the board, and the rules—are integrated into the whole, and the result is a game of chess. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-817">It is the relationship between these parts and the whole that determines the game.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-818">The same relationship holds true in a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-819">A story is the whole, and the elements that make up the story—the action, characters, conflicts, scenes, sequences, dialogue, action, Acts I, II, and III, incidents, episodes, events, music, locations, etc.—are the parts, and this relationship between the parts and the whole make up the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-820">Good structure is like the relationship between an ice cube and water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-821">An ice cube has a definite crystalline structure, and water has a definite molecular structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-822">But when the ice cube melts into water, how can you separate the molecules of ice from the molecules of water? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-823">Structure is like gravity: It is the glue that holds the story in place; it is the base, the foundation, the spine, the skeleton of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-824">And it is this relationship between the parts and the whole that holds the screenplay together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-825">It’s what makes it what it is.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-837">This is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-838">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-839"> of a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-840">Here’s how it’s broken down:</span></p>
<p class="a_head"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-841">ACT I IS THE SET-UP</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-842">If a screenplay is a story told with pictures, then what do all stories have in common? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-843">A beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily, as mentioned, in that order; it is a story told in pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-844">Aristotle talked about the three unities of dramatic action: time, place, and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-845">The normal Hollywood film is approximately two hours long, or 120 minutes; foreign films tend to be a little shorter, though that’s changing as we bridge the language of international film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-846">But in most cases, films are approximately two hours in length, give or take a few minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-847">This is a standard length, and today, when a contract is written in Hollywood between the filmmaker and production company, it states that when the movie is delivered, it will be no longer than 2 hours and 8 minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-848">That’s approximately 128 pages of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-849">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-850">Because it’s an economic decision that has evolved over the years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-851">At this writing, it costs approximately $10,000 to $12,000 per minute (and getting higher and higher every year) to shoot a Hollywood studio film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-852">Second, a two-hour movie has a definite advantage in the theaters simply because you can get in more viewings of the movie per day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-853">More screenings mean more money; more theaters mean more screenings, which means more money will be made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-854">Movies are show </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-855">business</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-856">, after all, and with the cost of moviemaking being so high, and getting higher as our technology evolves, today it’s really more business than show.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-857">The way it breaks down is this: One page of screenplay is approximately one minute of screen time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-858">It doesn’t matter whether the script is all action, all dialogue, or any combination of the two—generally speaking, a page of screenplay equals a minute of screen time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-859">It’s a good rule of thumb to follow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-860">There are exceptions to this, of course. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-861">The script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-862">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-863"> is only 118 pages, but the movie is more than three hours long.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-864">Act I, the beginning, is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately twenty or thirty pages long and is held together with the dramatic context known as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-865">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-866">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-867">Context is the space that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-868">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-869"> something in place—in this case, the content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-870">For example, the space inside a glass is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-871">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-872">; it holds the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-873">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-874"> in place—whether it’s water, beer, milk, coffee, tea, or juice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-875">If we want to get creative, a glass can also hold raisins, trail mix, nuts, grapes, etc.—but the space inside doesn’t change The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-876">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-877"> is what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-878">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-879"> the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-880">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-881"> in place.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-882">In this unit of dramatic action, Act I, the screenwriter </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-883">sets up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-884"> the story, establishes character, launches the dramatic premise (what the story is about), illustrates the situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and creates the relationships between the main character and the other characters who inhabit the landscape of his or her world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-885">As a writer you’ve only got about ten minutes to establish this, because the audience members can usually determine, either consciously or unconsciously, whether they do or don’t like the movie by that time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-886">If they don’t know what’s going on and the opening is vague or boring, their concentration and focus will falter and start wandering.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-887">Check it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-888">The next time you go to a movie, do a little exercise: Find out how long it takes you to make a decision about whether you like the film or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-889">A good indication is if you start thinking about getting something from the refreshment stand or find yourself shifting in your seat; if that happens, the chances are the filmmaker has lost you as a viewer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-890">Ten minutes is ten pages of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-891">I cannot emphasize enough that this first ten-page unit of dramatic action is the most important part of the screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1402">By doing research—whether in written sources such as books, magazines, or newspapers or through personal interviews—you acquire information. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1403">The information you collect allows you to operate from the position of choice, confidence, and responsibility. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1404">You can choose to use some, or all, or none of the material you’ve gathered; that’s your choice, dictated by the terms of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1405">Not using it because you don’t have it offers you no choice at all, and will always work against you and your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1406">Too many people start writing their material with only a vague, half-formed idea in their heads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1407">This works for about thirty pages, then falls apart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1408">You don’t know what happens next, or what to do next, or where to go, and you end up getting angry, confused, and frustrated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1409">Then, in most cases, you give up.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1410">There are two kinds of research. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1411">One I call </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1412">text</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1413"> research. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1414">That means going to the library and pulling out books and newspaper and magazine articles and reading about a period, people, a profession, or whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1415">If you’re writing a period piece or a historical piece, you need to gather information about the time and the events that happened during it and then weave your emotional through line into your characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1416">I get most of my information from reading about the period and any first-person writings I can find. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1417">If you’re writing about a subject that you don’t know much about, you need to get information to make your story line real, believable, and true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1418">Edward Zwick, who directed </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1419">The Last Samurai</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1420">, worked extensively with John Logan, the writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1421">Zwick spent more than a year reading about the Japanese culture and the samurai tradition.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1637">One of the most articulate literary theorists of the nineteenth century was the great American novelist Henry James, author of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1638">Portrait of a Lady, Wings of the Dove, Turn of the Screw</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1639">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1640">Daisy Miller</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1641">, among other masterworks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1642">James was fascinated with the art of fiction writing, and approached it like a scientist, the same way his brother, William James, the famous psychologist, studied the dynamics of the human mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1643">Henry James wrote several essays trying to document and define the intricacies of creating character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1644">In one of those essays, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1645">The Art of Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1646">, James poses a literary question: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1647">What is character but the determination of incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1648">And what is incident but the illumination of character?</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1649">It’s a profound statement.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1650">The key word, of course, is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1651">incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1652">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1653">According to the dictionary, an incident is “a specific occurrence or event that occurs in connection or relationship to something else.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1654">Screenplays are usually about a key incident, and the story is the character acting and reacting to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1655">It is the major source of all action and all character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1656">After twenty-five years of reading and analyzing screenplays and movies, I have only recently begun to understand the importance of the incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1657">All good movies, it seems, focus on the unfolding of a specific incident or event; and it is this incident that becomes the engine that powers the story to its completion.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1674">Events in a screenplay are specifically designed to bring out the truth about the characters so that we, the reader and audience, can transcend our ordinary lives and achieve a connection, or bond, between “them and us.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1675">We see ourselves in them and enjoy a moment, perhaps, of recognition and understanding.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1688">The reason why Henry James’s statement is so relevant is because the elements </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1689">within</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1690"> the character really determine the incident; how the character reacts to that incident is what illuminates and truly defines his/her character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1691">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1692">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1693">, it’s set up immediately, at the beginning of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1694">Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) set out for a weekend holiday in the mountains, stop at a bar, and meet a guy named Harlan, who takes a liking to Thelma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1695">He plies her with drinks, then attempts to rape her in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1696">It turns ugly, until Louise comes along, threatens Harlan with Thelma’s gun, and, when he mouths off to her, loses it, pulls the trigger, and kills him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1697">Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1698">It is the key incident in the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1699">Now the “real” story is about their attempt to escape to Mexico.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1700">As mentioned, Plot Point I is the true beginning of the screenplay and swings the story around into Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1701">For the rest of the story, Thelma and Louise are on the run. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1702">As they race down the highway of their life, like so many other characters in so many other movies, they are forced to come to grips with themselves, find out who they really are, and ultimately take responsibility for their lives and actions. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1703">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1704"> is a road movie, yes, but it’s really a journey of enlightenment, a journey of self-discovery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1705">And it begins with the incident, the hub of the wheel of action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1706">It is the character that determines the incident, in this case Louise’s killing Harlan, then fleeing in fear and uncertainty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1707">What’s important for me, and you, as writers, is to ask what it was within Louise’s character that caused her to pull the trigger—because this incident is what ultimately reveals and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1708">illuminates</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1709"> the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1710">In Louise’s case, it is an incident that happened to her when she was a young woman; it’s only mentioned briefly, but it’s implied that she was raped in Texas and then brought charges against her attackers, but could get no satisfaction, no revenge, no justice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1711">Indeed, instead of being seen as the victim, she was considered by many to have been the instigator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1712">At that moment, she made a promise to herself: She would never take one step inside the state of Texas ever again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1713">This decision ultimately brings about her death.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1714">Joseph Campbell reflects in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1715">The Power of Myth</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1716"> that in mythic terms, the first part of any journey of initiation must deal with the death of the old self and the resurrection of the new. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1717">Campbell says that the hero, or heroic figure, “moves not into outer space but into inward space, to the place from which all being comes, into the consciousness that is the source of all things, the kingdom of heaven within. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1718">The images are outward, but their reflection is inward.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1719">It seems to me that the Louise in Act I who pulled the trigger, killing Harlan, is not the Louise who really killed him; rather, it was the young Louise, caught in the web of female justice, Texas style, who actually pulled that trigger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1720">She never recovered from her experience, and it simmered in her consciousness below the thin veneer of time and memory, just waiting for a chance to erupt.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1721">Writers create characters in a variety of different ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1722">I once asked Waldo Salt how he went about creating characters, and he replied that the first thing he did was to choose a simple dramatic need; then he would add to it, coloring it until it became a universal chord common to Everyman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1723">For Waldo, that became the essence of his character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1724">And he was a master screenwriter, a major artist.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2266">I read </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2267">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2268"> over and over again, taking notes, literally studying it as if I were preparing for a final exam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2269">It was an incredible education. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2270">I began to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2271">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2272"> things: how Peckinpah structured and set up the story in the opening sequence, how he established the characters visually, then built the story to highlight the centerpiece—the ambush by the Apaches.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2273">When I was making documentaries for David Wolper, I understood the importance of having a strong opening scene or sequence, something that will immediately grab the attention of the reader or audience. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2274">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2275"> opens with a Halloween party at an isolated ranch on the Western frontier just before the end of the Civil War; the music’s playing, the people are dancing, laughing, and having a good time, while costumed children run around outside, playing games. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2276">Then Sam cuts from the painted face of a child playing cowboys and Indians to the face of an Apache brave painted for war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2277">Amid the music and dance, as children giggle and scream in joy and mock fright, the Apaches launch their attack, killing everyone and everything except the male children and the horses.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2278">It’s a remarkable opening, something I call “pure Peckinpah.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2279">The contradiction between the images of the children in their Halloween costumes and the painted faces of the Apaches killing and scalping was horrifying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2280">I marveled, too, at how Peckinpah introduces Major Dundee. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2281">The way he’s described in the stage directions tells us everything we need to know: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2282">“Opinionated, strong-willed, quick-tempered</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2283">….</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2284">An artist, perhaps a sculptor of battle, who knows that for him death is as close as the owl perched upon the thigh of night….He gives orders well and takes them badly….A wise man who can be a fool…who will go his own way come hell or high water…who so far has yet to fail.”</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2285">I wanted to write characters like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2286">I wanted to enrich the characters in my screenplays so that they were fully formed and realized, multidimensional, real people in real situations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2287">So I started asking myself questions: How do you take the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2288">idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2289"> of a person that exists in a scrambled, fragmented form and make him or her into a living, flesh-and-blood person, a person you can relate to and identify with? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2290">How do you go about putting life into your characters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2291">How do you build character?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2292">As soon as I phrased the questions I knew there was no definitive answer—because building character is part of the mystery and magic of the creative process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2293">It is an ongoing, never-ending, continuing practice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2294">In order to really solve the problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2295">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2296">, it’s essential to go into your characters and build the foundations and fabric of their lives, then add ingredients that will heighten and expand the portrait of who they are.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2297">So, I kept asking myself: What makes a good character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2298">What </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2299">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2300"> character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2301">To find the answer, I needed to figure out what qualities we all have in common.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2302">When you think about it, underneath this skin of ours we’re really the same, you and I; certain things unite us. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2303">We share the same needs, the same wants, the same fears and insecurities; we want to be loved, have people like us, be successful, happy, and healthy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2304">When I went back to reread </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2305">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2306"> with this in mind, I started analyzing the characters in terms of their individual needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2307">Reading it from this perspective, I saw four things, four essential qualities that seemed to go into the making of good characters: (1), the characters have a strong and defined </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2308">dramatic need;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2309"> (2), they have an individual </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2310">point of view;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2311"> (3), they personify an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2312">attitude;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2313"> and (4), they go through some kind of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2314">change</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2315">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2316">transformation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2317">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2318">Those four elements, those four qualities, make up good character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2319">Using that as a starting point, I saw that every main, or major, character has a strong dramatic need. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2320">Dramatic need</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2321"> is defined as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2322">what your main characters want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2323">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2324">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2325">dramatic need</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2326"> is what drives your characters through the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2327">It is their purpose, their mission, their motivation, driving them through the narrative action of the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2328">In most cases you can express the dramatic need in a sentence or two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2329">It is usually simple and can be stated through a line of dialogue, if you choose; or it does not have to be expressed at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2330">But you, as writer, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2331">must know</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2332"> your character’s dramatic need.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2657">Dialogue serves two main purposes: Either it moves the story forward, or it reveals information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2658">If the dialogue does not serve either one of these functions, then take it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2659">It’s okay for the first sixty pages of your first draft to be filled with awkward dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2660">Don’t worry about it—the last sixty pages will be smooth and functional because, again, the more you do it, the easier it gets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2661">And afterward you can go back and smooth out the dialogue in the first part of the screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2674">We had a good time, and it began a process that seemingly managed to parallel the symmetrical chaos of the creative experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2675">Creating a character </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2676">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2677"> a process, and until you’ve done it, until you’ve experienced it, you’re more than likely to stumble around awkwardly like a blind man in a fog complaining about how things aren’t where they used to be.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2678">There are really only two ways to approach writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2679">One is to get an idea, then create your characters to fit that idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2680">Three people stealing moon rocks from NASA in Houston is an example of this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2681">You take the idea, then “pour” your characters into it: a down-and-out jockey getting an opportunity to ride in the Santa Anita Handicap, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2682">Seabiscuit;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2683"> or a boxer getting the opportunity to fight the Heavyweight Champion of the World, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2684">Rocky;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2685"> or a man holding up a bank to get money for a sex-change operation, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2686">Dog Day Afternoon;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2687"> or an embittered Civil War mercenary captured by his enemies and transformed by their way of life, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2688">The Last Samurai;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2689"> or a man setting out to break the Water Speed Record, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2690">The Run</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2691">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2692">In this scenario, you create the characters to fit the idea.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2747">“No,” I say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2748">Late twenties or early thirties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2749">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2750">someone asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2751">I reply that when you’re writing a screenplay, you’re writing it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2752">for</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2753"> someone, for a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2754">star</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2755">, someone who is “bankable.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2756">Right now, I would think of Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Halle Berry, Renee Zellweger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2757">We move on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2758">“What’s her name?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2759">I ask.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2760">The name Sarah comes into my head, and we go with it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2761">“Sarah what?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2762">Sarah Townsend, I decide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2763">A name is a name.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2764">Our starting point becomes Sarah Townsend, late twenties or early thirties, from Boston. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2765">She is our subject.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2766">Then we create the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2767">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2768">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2769">Let’s get her personal history. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2770">For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to give one answer to each question I ask. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2771">In class there are several answers given and I select only one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2772">Feel free to disagree with them if you want; or make up your own answers, create your own character, your own story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2773">“What about her parents?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2774">I ask. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2775">“Who’s her father?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2776">A doctor, we decide.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2777">Her mother?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2778">A doctor’s wife.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2779">“What’s her father’s name?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2780">Lionel Townsend.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2781">What’s his background?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2782">We toss a lot of ideas around and finally end up with this: Lionel Townsend belongs to the upper strata of Boston society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2783">Wealthy, smart, conservative, he attended medical school at Boston University, then went to St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2784">Louis to do his internship at Washington University.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2785">What about Sarah’s mother? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2786">What was she before she became a doctor’s wife?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2787">A teacher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2788">“Elizabeth’s her name,” someone remarks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2789">Good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2790">Elizabeth might have been teaching in St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2791">Louis when she met Lionel, and she continues teaching grade school during the time he’s completing his medical school education. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2792">When he begins his medical practice back in Boston, she gets pregnant and gives up her teaching.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2793">“When did Sarah’s parents get married?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2794">I ask.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2795">If Sarah’s in her late twenties, early thirties, her parents must have married in the early ’70s, either during or after the Vietnam War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2796">They’ve been married more than thirty years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2797">“How’d you figure that out?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2798">someone asks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2799">“Subtraction,” I reply.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2800">What’s the relationship between mother and father?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2801">Consistent, and possibly routine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2802">For what it’s worth, I add, Sarah’s mother’s a Capricorn, her father’s a Libra.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2803">When was Sarah born?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2804">Early or mid ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2805">April, an Aries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2806">Does she have any brothers or sisters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2807">No, she’s an only child.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2808">Remember, this is a process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2809">For every question asked there are many answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2810">If you don’t agree with them, change them to create your own character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2811">What kind of childhood did she have?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2812">A lonely one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2813">She wanted brothers and sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2814">She was alone most of the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2815">She probably had a good relationship with her mother until she was in her teens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2816">Then, as always between parent and child, things went haywire.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2817">What’s the relationship between Sarah and her father?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2818">Good, but strained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2819">Possibly he wanted a son instead of a daughter, and to please her father, Sarah became a tomboy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2820">Possibly Sarah is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2821">always</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2822"> trying to find a way to please her father, to earn his love and affection. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2823">Becoming a tomboy helps with this problem, but creates another one by antagonizing her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2824">This will figure later in her relationships with men.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2825">Sarah’s family is like all other families, but we’re sketching in as much detailed conflict as we can for dramatic purposes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2826">We’re beginning to grasp the dynamics of the Townsend family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2827">So far, there’s not been too much disagreement, so we continue to explore the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2828">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2829"> of Sarah Townsend.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2830">I remark that many young women search for their father or for father figures throughout their lives, much in the way that many men search for their mothers in the women they meet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2831">It’s interesting to use this as a foundation of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2832">Not that it happens all the time, but it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2833">does</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2834"> happen; therefore let’s be aware of it so that we can possibly use it to our advantage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2835">There’s a lot of discussion about this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2836">I explain that when you’re creating a character, you have to compile nuances that you can either use or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2837">I tell the class this exercise is based on trial and error: We’re going to use what works and discard what doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2838">Her mother probably educates Sarah in the ways of the world and, no doubt, cautions her about men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2839">She might tell her daughter, “You can never trust a man. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2840">They’re only after one thing—your body.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2841">Or, “They don’t like a woman who’s too smart.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2842">And so on and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2843">What Sarah’s mother tells her may be true for some of you, or it may not be, I tell the class; use your own experience in creating a character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2844">Perhaps at an early age Sarah expressed the desire to become a doctor, like her father, and her mother cautioned her against that, saying, “It’s a long, tough grind.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2845">Maybe her mother is a person who wants to be right all the time, or a person for whom looking good, appearance, is everything, like Mary Tyler Moore’s character in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2846">Ordinary People</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2847"> (Alvin Sargent). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2848">Let’s move on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2849">What kind of high school experience did Sarah have?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2850">Active, social, the beginnings of rebellion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2851">She made good grades without having to work very hard for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2852">She had many friends, and was a leader in rebelling against many of the school’s restrictive policies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2853">Her music tastes became eclectic and her parents endured these years with patience but not too much understanding.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2854">Most young people rebel, and Sarah’s no exception. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2855">She graduates and goes to Vassar, which pleases her mother, but decides she wants to major in political science because she wants to help change “the system.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2856">This, of course, upsets her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2857">Sarah is socially active, and has an affair with a graduate student in political science. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2858">Her actions, based on her rebellious nature, become part of her character—she has a unique point of view, a determined attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2859">She graduates from college with a degree in political science.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2860">Now what?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2861">She moves to New York to get a job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2862">Her father supports her in this move. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2863">Her mother does not; she’s upset. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2864">She believes Sarah’s not doing the things she “should” be doing—finding a stable career, possibly marrying and settling down, as befits an intelligent young woman from Boston.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2865">Remember, I add, drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2866">We’re searching for ways to generate tension in our material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2867">I explain that the relationship between mother and daughter may be useful during the screenplay, or it may not be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2868">Let’s see whether it works or not before we make any decision about it, I advise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2869">The writer always operates from the position of choice and responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2870">Sarah’s move to New York is a major crossroads in our creation of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2871">So far, we’ve focused on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2872">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2873"> of Sarah Townsend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2874">Now we’re going to be creating </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2875">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2876">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2877">Let’s define the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2878">exterior</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2879"> forces working on Sarah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2880">Here’s the diagram:</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2882">Let’s explore the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2883">exterior</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2884"> forces working on Sarah.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2885">At this point, someone suggests that we create a story using a war as backdrop or as the context of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2886">We talk about that for a bit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2887">I ask, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2888">Which</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2889"> war? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2890">The Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the war in Iraq (even the Korean War or World War II)—all of them, no matter in what period of history they occurred, would lend some background tension to our story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2891">We discuss this.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2892">We decide it’s a good idea, and I suggest that we could use the Vietnam War as the background of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2893">All it means is changing some of the background events and dates working on Sarah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2894">We decide to try it and see what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2895">The events we’ve created are still valid to some degree, and will not have to be changed radically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2896">We change what we need to, get our time lines straight, and decide that Sarah leaves college and moves to New York in the early ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2897">So, we research the times.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2898">Slowly, the story begins to take shape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2899">Sarah arrives in New York City in the spring in the early ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2900">What does she do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2901">Gets an apartment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2902">Her father sends her some money each month, and does not tell her mother; Sarah prefers it that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2903">Then what?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2904">She gets a job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2905">What kind of job does she get?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2906">Let’s discuss that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2907">We know basically the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2908">kind</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2909"> of person Sarah is: upper-middle-class, independent, free-spirited, rebellious, on her own for the first time and loving it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2910">Committed to herself and her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2911">Let’s start getting more specific.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2912">New York, 1972. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2913">What are the exterior forces working on Sarah? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2914">Here’s where some research would come in handy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2915">Nixon is in the White House. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2916">The Vietnam War still rages; the country is in a state of nervous exhaustion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2917">Nixon goes to China. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2918">McGovern’s gaining in the presidential primaries and there’s hope “he might be the one.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2919">George Wallace is gunned down in a shopping center. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2920">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2921"> is in release. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2922">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2923"> is in production.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2924">What kind of job would fit Sarah dramatically?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2925">A job working for a political campaign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2926">Someone suggests Sarah could be working at the McGovern headquarters in New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2927">This is a point of discussion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2928">(If we wanted to make this a contemporary story, using the war in Iraq as a background force, we could easily have Sarah working for John Kerry’s campaign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2929">The context would be the same, only the content would change.) We talk about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2930">Finally, I explain that for me the job satisfies her rebellious nature; it reflects her first independent step away from home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2931">It satisfies her activist political stance and draws upon her background as a political science major in college, and it gives her parents something to disapprove of—both of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2932">We’re going after conflict, right?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2933">From now on, through a process of trial and error, we’re going to be searching for a theme, or dramatic premise: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2934">something</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2935"> that will move Sarah in a particular direction to generate a dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2936">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2937">subject</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2938"> of a screenplay, remember, is an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2939">action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2940"> and a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2941">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2942">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2943">We’ve got the character; now we’ve got to find the action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2944">This is a hit-and-miss operation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2945">Things are suggested, changed, rearranged; mistakes are made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2946">I’ll say one thing, then contradict myself in the next sentence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2947">Don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2948">We’re after a specific result—a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2949">We’ve simply got to let ourselves find it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2950">New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2951">1972. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2952">An election year. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2953">Nixon versus McGovern. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2954">Sarah Townsend is working for the McGovern campaign as a paid staff member. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2955">Who are her parents voting for?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2956">What does Sarah discover about politics from her experience in the campaign?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2957">That politics aren’t necessarily clean or idealistic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2958">Perhaps she discovers something illegal going on—would she do anything about it?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3312">It’s obvious, when you think about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3313">Your story always moves forward—it follows a path, a direction, a line of progression from beginning to end. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3314">Direction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3315"> is defined as a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3316">line of development</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3317">, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3318">path along which something lies</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3319">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3320">In the same way, everything is related in the screenplay, as it is in life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3321">You don’t have to know the specific details of your ending when you sit down to write your screenplay, but you have to know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3322">what happens</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3323"> and how it affects the characters.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3324">I use an example out of my own life to illustrate this.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3325">There was a moment in my life when I didn’t know what I wanted to do or be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3326">I had graduated from high school, my mother had just died, as my father had some years before, and I didn’t want to get stuck in some job or go off to college. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3327">I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to travel around the country and see whether I could find a direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3328">My older brother was in medical school in St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3329">Louis at the time, and I knew I could stay with him or visit friends in Colorado and New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3330">So, one morning, I packed my bags, got into my car, and headed east on Highway 66.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3331">I never knew where I was going till I got there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3332">I preferred it that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3333">I had good times and bad times, and loved it; I was like a cloud on the wind, drifting without aim or purpose.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3334">I did that for almost two years.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3335">Then, one day, driving through the Arizona desert, I realized I had traveled that same road before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3336">Everything was the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3337">It was the same mountain in the same barren desert, but it was two years later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3338">In reality, I saw I was going nowhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3339">I had spent two years trying to get my head straight, and I still had no purpose, no aim, no goal, no destination, no </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3340">direction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3341">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3342">I suddenly saw my future—it was nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3343">I became aware of time slipping away, almost like an acid trip, and I knew I had to do something. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3344">So I stopped wandering and went back to school. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3345">At least I’d have a degree after four years, whatever that meant! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3346">Of course, it didn’t work out the way I expected—it never does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3347">But it was there, at Berkeley, that I met and worked with the man who would change my life forever: my mentor, Jean Renoir. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3348">“The future,” he told me, “is film.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3349">When you go on a trip, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3350">you are going someplace;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3351"> you have a destination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3352">If I’m going to San Francisco, that’s my destination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3353">How I get there is a matter of choice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3354">I can fly, drive, take a bus or train, ride a motorcycle or bike, jog, hitchhike, or walk.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3355">I can </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3356">choose</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3357"> how to get there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3358">And life is choice—personal choices, creative choices—and learning how to take responsibility for them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3359">Understanding the basic dynamics of a story’s resolution is essential. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3360">By itself, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3361">resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3362"> means “a solution or explanation.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3363">And that process begins at the onset, at the very beginning of the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3364">When you are laying out your story line, building it, putting it together, scene by scene, act by act, you must first determine the resolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3365">What is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3366">solution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3367"> of your story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3368">At the moment of the initial conception of your screenplay, when you were still working out the idea and shaping it into a dramatic story line, you made a creative choice, a decision, and determined what the resolution was going to be.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3397">The first draft of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3398">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3399"> is much more romantic than the others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3400">In this draft, Robert Towne has Jake Gittes opening and closing the story with a voice-over narration, just the way Raymond Chandler does in most of his stories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3401">When Evelyn Mulwray walks into Jake Gittes’s life, he becomes involved with a woman from a different class; she is wealthy, sophisticated, and beautiful, and he falls head over heels in love with her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3402">Near the end of the story, when she learns that her father, Noah Cross (John Huston), has attempted to hire Gittes to find her daughter/sister, she realizes that her father will stop at nothing to get the girl, so she sets out to kill him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3403">She knows it’s the only solution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3404">She phones Noah Cross and tells him to meet her along a deserted part of the coast near San Pedro. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3405">When Cross arrives, it is raining heavily, and as he walks up the dirt road looking for his daughter, she jams down her car’s accelerator and tries to run him over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3406">He narrowly escapes and races to a marshy area nearby. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3407">Evelyn leaves the car, pulls a gun, and begins tracking him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3408">Shots are fired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3409">He hides behind a large wooden sign advertising fresh bait. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3410">Evelyn sees him and fires again and again into the sign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3411">Blood mingles with the falling rain and Noah Cross falls over backward, dead.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3412">A few moments later, Gittes and Lieutenant Escobar arrive at the scene and we cut to various shots of modern-day Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3413">Gittes, in voice-over narration, tells us that Evelyn Mulwray spent four years in prison for killing her father, that he managed to get her daughter/sister safely back to Mexico, and that the land scheme Noah Cross so brilliantly conceived resulted in a profit of about $300 million. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3414">The resolution of this first draft is that justice and order prevail: Noah Cross gets what he deserves, and the graft and corruption of the water scandal leads to Los Angeles becoming what it is today.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3415">That was the first draft.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3416">At that point, Robert Evans, the producer (and the man responsible for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3417">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3418"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3419">Love Story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3420">), brought in Roman Polanski </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3421">(The Pianist)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3422"> as director. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3423">Polanski had his own ideas about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3424">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3425">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3426">Changes were discussed, then made, and the relations between Polanski and Towne became tense and strained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3427">They disagreed about many things, mostly about the ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3428">Polanski wanted an ending in which Noah Cross got away with murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3429">The second draft is therefore altered considerably. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3430">It is less romantic, the action is trimmed and tightened, and the focus of the resolution changed substantially. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3431">The second draft is very close to the final one.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3432">In this second draft, Noah Cross gets away with murder, graft, and incest, and Evelyn Mulwray becomes the innocent victim who pays for her father’s crime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3433">Towne’s point of view when he began writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3434">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3435"> is that those who commit certain types of crimes, like murder, robbery, rape, or arson, are punished by being sent to prison, but those who commit crimes against an entire community are often rewarded by having streets named after them or plaques dedicated to them at City Hall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3436">Los Angeles literally owes its survival to the water scandal known as the Rape of the Owens Valley, and it provides the backdrop of the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3437">The ending of the second draft now has Gittes planning to meet Evelyn Mulwray in Chinatown; he has arranged for her to be taken to Mexico by Curly (Burt Young), the man in the opening scene, and her daughter/sister is waiting at the boat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3438">Gittes has discovered that Cross is the man behind the murders as well as the water scandal, and when Gittes accuses him, Cross takes him prisoner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3439">They leave for Chinatown, and when they arrive, Cross tries to detain Evelyn, but Gittes manages to subdue the older man. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3440">Evelyn races to her car, only to be blocked by Lieutenant Escobar. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3441">Gittes makes a drastic move and lunges at the policeman; during the scuffle, Evelyn drives away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3442">Shots are fired and she is killed, shot in the head. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3443">This is close to the final draft.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3444">The last scene shows Noah Cross weeping over Evelyn’s body while a stunned Gittes tells Escobar that Cross is the man responsible for everything.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3445">In the third, and final, draft, the ending has been modified slightly to accent Towne’s point of view, but the resolution is still the same as in the second draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3446">Gittes is taken to Chinatown, but Lieutenant Escobar is already there, and arrests the private detective for withholding evidence, putting him in handcuffs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3447">When Evelyn arrives with her daughter/sister, Cross approaches the young girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3448">Evelyn tells him to stay away, and when he doesn’t, she pulls a gun and shoots him in the arm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3449">She gets into her car and drives off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3450">There is a shot fired, and Evelyn is killed, shot through the eye. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3451">(As a side note, Sophocles has Oedipus tear out his eyes when he realizes he has committed incest with his mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3452">I find this an intriguing parallel, whether intentional or not.)</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3453">Horrified by Evelyn’s death, Cross puts his arm protectively around his daughter/granddaughter and forcefully whisks her away into the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3454">“Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3455">Noah Cross, indeed, gets away with it all: murder, the water scandal, the girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3456">“You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it,” Gittes tells Curly in the opening scene.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3479">It seems that one of the major difficulties screenwriters deal with is the problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3480">endings:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3481"> how to end your screenplay so it works effectively, so it’s satisfying and fulfilling, so it makes an emotional impact on the reader and audience, so it’s not contrived or predictable, so it’s real, believable, not forced or fabricated; an ending that resolves all the main story points; an ending, in short, that works.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3482">More easily said than done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3483">What’s so interesting about endings is that, in most cases, the ending itself is not really the problem; it’s the fact that it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3484">doesn’t work effectively</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3485">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3486">It’s either too soft or too slow, too wordy or too vague, too expensive or not expensive enough, too down, too up, too contrived, too predictable, or too unbelievable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3487">Sometimes it’s simply not dramatic enough to resolve the story line, or maybe a surprise twist suddenly comes out of nowhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3488">Many aspiring screenwriters feel the best way to end their screenplay is by having the main character die, or in some extreme cases, having everybody die. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3489">It’s tight, complete, easy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3490">But you can do better than that.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3494">For me, the ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3495">Be it a wedding, funeral, or divorce; a career change or the ending of one relationship and the beginning of a new one; a move to a new city or country; or winning or losing your life savings in Las Vegas—it’s all the same: The end of one thing is always the beginning of something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3496">If you overcome a serious medical challenge, like cancer or a heart attack, or go through a near-death experience, it’s a brand-new beginning with an awareness that every breath you take is a sacred gift, a blessing of joy and gratitude.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3508">With that in mind, it’s interesting to ask yourself the question: What is the opening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3509">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3510"> screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3511">How does it begin? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3512">What is the opening scene or sequence? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3513">What do you write after “fade in”?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3637">By the end of the movie, Turner has tracked down the mysterious Lionel Atwood—a high-level executive in the CIA—but he doesn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3638">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3639"> Atwood is or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3640">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3641"> his connection is, if any, to the murders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3642">In the resolution scene, Turner establishes Atwood as the man who ordered the murders, determining that he is responsible for establishing a secret cell of the CIA within the CIA because of the world’s oil fields. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3643">This now established, Joubert (Max von Sydow) appears, the hired assassin of the intelligence underworld, and abruptly kills Atwood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3644">Turner is now back in the employ of the “company,” the CIA. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3645">He breathes easier; he’s alive—“at least for now,” as Joubert reminds him.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3646">No loose ends. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3647">Everything is resolved dramatically, in terms of action and character; all questions raised are answered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3648">The story is complete.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3649">The filmmakers added a “tag” scene at the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3650">Joe Turner and Higgins are standing in front of the New York Times Building, and Turner states that if anything happens to him, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3651">Times</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3652"> has the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3653">But “will they print it?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3654">Higgins asks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3655">It’s a good question.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3656">If we think about the relationship between the ending and beginning, the parts and the whole, we can look at the story’s resolution as a whole made up of the ending, the parts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3657">The resolution is the seed of the ending, and if planted and nurtured correctly, it can sprout into a full-fledged dramatic experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3658">That’s what we all strive for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3659">Endings are manifested in the resolution and the resolution is conceived in the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3660">If you don’t know your ending, then ask yourself </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3661">what you would like the ending to be</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3662">, regardless of whether it’s too simple, too trite, too happy, or too sad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3663">And please, please, don’t get caught up in the game of “What kind of an ending would </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3664">they</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3665"> like?”—whoever </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3666">they</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3667"> are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3668">What ending do </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3669">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3670"> want? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3671">It doesn’t matter whether it’s “commercial” or not, because nobody knows what’s commercial or not anyway.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3672">You might find it necessary to write an essay about what happens in Act III so that the story line is clear and defined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3673">Then go through the action and in free association, in a one- or two-page essay, begin to list the ways this film can end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3674">Don’t be attached to any single shot, scene, or sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3675">Just list the various ways the endings can be achieved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3676">If that doesn’t clarify the action, and you’re still unclear about how the material should end, simply write down how you would like it to end, regardless of budget, believability, or anything else that gets in the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3677">Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas, without any regard as to how to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3678">That’s really the first step in the completion process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3679">It’s important to tie together all the loose ends of the narrative line so the screenplay becomes a complete reading and visual experience (in the mind’s eye) that rings true and is integral to the action and the characters.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3680">There are other ways to end your screenplay as well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3681">There may be an instance where Act III becomes an entire sequence, a full and complete unit of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3682">The ending of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3683">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3684"> is such a case; as are the endings of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3685">Witness</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3686"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3687">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3688">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3689">And if you look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3690">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3691">, the ending is really a “bookend”: the Pumpkin and Honey Bunny (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) robbery attempt in the restaurant—which, coincidentally, opens the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3692">Endings and beginnings are connected, right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3693">In each of these scripts the ending completes the action of Act III.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3694">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3695">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3696">, the entire third act focuses on the astronauts’ return to Earth, as we follow the action from the moment the LEM separates from the spacecraft, cutting back and forth to the command center, to the anxious three minutes that turns out to be four, waiting for them to plunge through the atmosphere, not knowing whether the heat shield will protect them or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3697">When they finally do break through the cloud cover and land safely in the ocean and are rescued, that is the resolution; the ending is simply the voice-over of Jim Lovell telling us what happened to the three astronauts after their ordeal in space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3698">It’s played over shots of them on the aircraft carrier.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3699">The Plot Point at the end of Act II in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3700">Witness</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3701"> has John Book (Harrison Ford) and Rachel completing their relationship as they embrace underneath the birdhouse that Book had broken when he first arrived, and that has now been restored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3702">Act III opens when the three crooked cops pull over the ridge, park their car, pull out their weapons, and make their way down to the farmhouse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3703">Once there, they break into the farmhouse and hold Rachel and the grandfather hostage while they hunt for Book and young Samuel, trying to kill them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3704">So the entire third act is really a shoot-out, and the end emerges from that action; John Book says good-bye to Rachel and young Samuel, and over the end credits, as he drives the car up the long dirt road leading back to Philadelphia, Daniel, Rachel’s suitor (Alexander Godunov), walks toward the farmhouse. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3705">Witness</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3706"> is a great little film that works on all levels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3707">The ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3708">It’s a little different with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3709">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3710"> (Michael Schiffer). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3711">At Plot Point II, the emergency action message has been partially received, and while it is being deciphered, the Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman characters are at an uneasy standoff as the countdown to launch the nuclear missiles continues. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3712">Act III is an entire sequence, and ends when they finally receive the complete message telling them to cancel the nuclear strike. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3713">That’s the resolution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3714">The ending is something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3715">There is a little tag added on after the action is complete: A naval inquiry is held, and it is decided that both men were right in their actions, because the naval regulations were unclear on this situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3716">The Gene Hackman character retires from active duty, and the Denzel Washington character will be promoted to captain and receive command of his own ship.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3717">Two different points of view, resolved, effective, complete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3718">It’s what a good ending is meant to provide.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3719">So what makes a good ending? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3720">It has to work, first of all, by satisfying the story; when we reach the final fade-out and walk away from the movie experience, we want to feel full and satisfied, much as if we were leaving the table after a good meal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3721">It’s this feeling of satisfaction that must be fulfilled in order for an ending to work effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3722">And, of course, it’s got to be believable.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3723">What you want in your screenplay is the best possible ending that works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3724">You want to be true to your story line and not have to resort to any tricks, gimmicks, or contrived elements in order to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3725">Sometimes you start out writing with a specific ending in mind and you base the structure and story line around it, but as you’re writing the story, you suddenly get a better idea about how to end the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3726">Go with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3727">Let it change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3728">It probably </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3729">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3730"> a better ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3731">That’s where you have to trust your creative self, your intuition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3732">But, though it’s good to accept that your ending may change as you’re writing, that doesn’t mean you should begin writing without knowing your ending.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3733">If I could sum up the concept of endings and state the one most important thing to remember, I would say: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3734">The ending comes out of the beginning</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3735">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3736">Someone, or something, initiates an action, and how that action is resolved becomes the story line of the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3737">The Chinese say that “the longest journey begins with the first step,” and in many philosophical systems “endings and beginnings” are connected; as in the concept of yin and yang, two concentric circles joined together, forever united, forever opposed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3738">If you can find a way to illustrate this in your screenplay, it is to your advantage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3739">This is something you can study. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3740">Read as many scripts as you can. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3741">There are several Web sites that offer downloadable screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3742">Just Google “screenplays” and check out the sites. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3743">And you should be seeing and analyzing as many films as you can, at least two movies a week, either in movie theaters or on DVD or video. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3744">Movies are available to everyone now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3745">You should see all kinds of movies: good films, bad films, foreign films, old films, new films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3746">Every film you see becomes a learning experience; if you examine it, it will generate a process, giving you an expanded awareness of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3747">A movie should be viewed as a working session: Talk about it, discuss it with friends or loved ones; see whether you can isolate its structure; see whether it fits the paradigm or not.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3865">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3866">Because </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3867">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3868"> is a film that works on all levels: story, characters, historical perspective, visual dynamics, and above all, the basic essentials that illustrate screenwriting as a craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3869">The film is a mystery-thriller in the style and tradition of Raymond Chandler; Robert Towne used the Owens Valley Scandal of the early 1900s as the dramatic backdrop to the story, but updated the action from the turn of the century to Los Angeles in 1937. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3870">In this way, Towne achieved the same revolutionary shift in filmmaking as did the Flemish painters of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, who placed the portraits of their Belgium patrons against the backdrop of Italian landscapes, a move that changed the course of art history.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3871">I’ve written a lot about my experience of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3872">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3873">, and I still vividly recall the first time I saw it, at an industry screening at Paramount. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3874">I was working at Cinemobile at the time, and there was a light rain falling as I pulled into the Paramount lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3875">As I walked through the dampness of early evening, I did not want to be there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3876">It had been an extremely full and stressful day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3877">I had read my usual quota of scripts, attended my usual quota of meetings, and had a large and late lunch with a writer during which I drank a little too much wine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3878">My throat was raw, and I felt I was coming down with a cold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3879">Nothing would be better, I thought, than soaking in a long hot bath, having a nice cup of tea, and crawling into bed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3880">The film began, and as the story unfolded, my critical mind kicked in and I started a little dialogue in which I was complaining about the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3881">I thought it was flat, the characters dull and one-dimensional. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3882">Before I knew it, I had nodded off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3883">I don’t know how much of the film I missed, I just knew it was one of those evenings where my body was in the screening room, but I certainly was not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3884">When I heard the last lines of the film, “Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown,” that’s exactly what I wanted to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3885">By the time I got home, I had already forgotten about it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3886">So much for my introduction to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3887">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3888">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3889">A short time later, I had the opportunity to interview Robert Towne, and during the course of our conversation I asked how he went about creating his characters, especially how he conceived Jake Gittes, the Jack Nicholson character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3890">He replied that the first question he often asks himself when approaching his character is “What is this character afraid of?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3891">In other words, what is his/her deepest fear? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3892">Gittes, a private detective who specializes in “discreet investigation,” has a certain reputation to uphold, so he always wants to “look good.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3893">He does everything to make a good impression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3894">He dresses immaculately, has his shoes shined every day, and has his own code of ethics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3895">Gittes’s unspoken, deep-seated fear is not being taken seriously, looking foolish.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3896">I was very impressed with Bob Towne, both by what he said and how he said it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3897">He was open, insightful, articulate, engaging, and extremely literate, qualities I genuinely admire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3898">I was so impressed that I wanted to see </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3899">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3900"> again; I wanted to see if I’d be able to catch those little nuances of character and story that Towne had spoken about that I had missed during my first viewing of the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3901">So, one night after work, I went to see it again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3902">And this time, by the end of the film, when Evelyn Mulwray, the innocent victim, is killed in Chinatown, I felt I had really seen the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3903">When I heard that familiar last line, “Forget it, Jake It’s Chinatown,” I was touched, moved, and inspired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3904">The film lingered with me over the next few days, and various scenes kept coming back to mind.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3905">My experience of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3906">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3907"> was literally a voyage of discovery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3908">Against the backdrop of water runoff and several murders, we follow Jake Gittes as he uncovers the puzzle, one piece at a time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3909">We learn what’s going on at the same time that Gittes does; audience and character are linked together as they connect the bits and pieces of seemingly unrelated information, as they assemble this giant jigsaw puzzle.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3910">From the very first images on screen—a series of photographs showing a man and woman having sex in the park—we know this is a story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3911">Over these pictures, we hear the moans and groans of Curly, the husband of the woman, played by Burt Young. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3912">What does this show? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3913">What Jake Gittes, the main character, does for a living. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3914">He’s a private detective specializing in divorces, unfaithful spouses, and “going through other people’s dirty linen,” as one of the characters remarks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3915">It’s his métier.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3916">Jake’s character is defined by what he does, his actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3917">Towne sets up the story in the very first scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3918">When the phony Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3919">Mulwray (Diane Ladd) hires Jake to find out who her husband is having an affair with, he begins his surveillance of Hollis Mulwray. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3920">As he does, the audience learns what Gittes learns.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3921">After Gittes follows Mulwray to the dried-out Los Angeles River bed, then to the ocean, his long surveillance is rewarded when he witnesses water being dumped into the ocean. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3922">Several hours later, when Gittes returns to his car, he picks a leaflet off the windshield declaring, “Our city is dying of thirst!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3923">and “Save our city.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3924">This theme of water is an organic, thematic thread, woven through the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3925">As I began tracing the connection of water to the story, I felt like Gittes when Noah Cross (John Huston) tells him, “You may think you know what’s going on, but believe me, you don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3926">When Gittes finds “the girl” at the end of Act I and closes the case, he sees the pictures he had taken on the front page of the newspaper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3927">(And if you look closely in the background of this scene, you’ll see a car overheating from lack of water.) The headlines scream “scandal,” and when Jake returns to his office, he finds a woman waiting for him: Faye Dunaway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3928">She confirms they’ve never met, then declares she could never have hired him to find out who her husband is having an affair with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3929">“You see, my name is Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3930">Evelyn Mulwray”: the real Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3931">Mulwray.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3932">This is the key incident in the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3933">It is the “key” that unlocks the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3934">If Faye Dunaway is the real Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3935">Mulwray, who is the Diane Ladd character who hired Gittes, claiming to be Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3936">Mulwray? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3937">And who hired the phony Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3938">Mulwray? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3939">And why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3940">That’s the question that shocks Gittes into action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3941">It is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3942">true</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3943"> beginning of the story.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4308">The main character, Jake Gittes, is introduced in his office, showing photographs of Curly’s wife being unfaithful.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4309">We learn things about Gittes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4310">On page 1, for example, we find that he “looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4311">He is shown to be a meticulous man who uses his “handkerchief to wipe away the plunk of perspiration on his desk.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4312">When he walks up the steps of City Hall a few pages later, he is “impeccably dressed.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4313">These </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4314">visual</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4315"> descriptions convey character traits that reflect his personality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4316">Notice how Gittes is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4317">not physically described</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4318"> at all; he’s not tall, thin, fat, short, or anything else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4319">He seems like a nice guy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4320">“I wouldn’t take your last dime,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4321">“What kind of a guy do you think I am?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4322">Yet he offers Curly a drink from a “cheaper bottle of bourbon from the several fifths of more expensive whiskeys.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4323">He’s vulgar, yet exudes a certain amount of charm and sophistication. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4324">He’s the kind of man who wears monogrammed shirts and carries silk handkerchiefs, who has his shoes shined and hair cut at least once a week.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4325">On page 4, Towne reveals the dramatic situation </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4326">visually</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4327"> in the stage directions: “on the pebbled glass can be read J.J. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4328">GITTES and Associates—DISCREET INVESTIGATION.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4329">Gittes is a private detective who specializes in divorce work, or “other people’s dirty linen,” as the cop Loach says about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4330">Later, we’ll learn he’s an ex-cop who left the force; when Escobar tells him he made lieutenant, Gittes suffers a twinge of envy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4331">The dramatic premise is established on page 5 when the phony Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4332">Mulwray informs Jake Gittes, “My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4333">That statement sets up everything that follows: Gittes, the ex-cop, “checks out the detailing of Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4334">Mulwray’s dress—her handbag, shoes, etc.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4335">That’s his job, and he’s very good at what he does.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4336">When Gittes tracks down and takes pictures of “the little twist” Mulwray is supposedly having an affair with, as far as he is concerned, the case is closed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4337">The next day he’s surprised to find the pictures he took on the front page of the newspaper, with headlines declaring that the head of the Department of Water and Power has been “caught” in a love nest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4338">He doesn’t know how his pictures got into the paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4339">When he returns to his office he is further surprised to find the real Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4340">Mulwray there to greet him—the key incident and the Plot Point at the end of Act I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4341">“Do you know me?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4342">she asks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4343">“No,” Gittes replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4344">“I would have remembered.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4345">“Since you agree we’ve never met, you must also agree that I haven’t hired you to do anything—certainly not spy on my husband,” she says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4346">As she leaves, her attorney hands Gittes a complaint that could take his license away and smear his name and reputation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4347">Gittes doesn’t know what’s going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4348">If this woman is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4349">real</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4350"> Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4351">Mulwray, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4352">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4353"> was the woman who hired him, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4354">why</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4355">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4356">More important, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4357">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4358"> hired the woman to hire him? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4359">Someone has gone to a lot of trouble to set him up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4360">“I’m not the one who’s supposed to be caught with my pants down,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4361">He’s going to find out who’s responsible, and why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4362">That is Jake Gittes’s dramatic need, and it drives him through the story until he solves the mystery.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4363">The dramatic premise—“My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman”—sets up the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4364">direction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4365"> of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4366">And direction, remember, is “a line of development.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4367">In the interview I did with Robert Towne, he said he approached </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4368">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4369"> from the point of view that “some crimes are punished because they can be punished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4370">If you kill somebody, rob or rape somebody, you’ll be caught and thrown into jail. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4371">But crimes against an entire community you really can’t punish, so you end up rewarding them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4372">You know, those people who get their names on streets and plaques at City Hall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4373">And that’s the basic point of view of the story.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4374">“You know something, Jake?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4375">Curly tells Gittes on page 2. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4376">“I think I’ll kill her,” meaning his wife.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4377">Gittes responds with the prophetic lines that illustrate the script’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4378">“You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4379">You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4380">Curly certainly can’t get away with murder, but Noah Cross, Evelyn Mulwray’s father and former head of the Department of Water and Power along with Hollis Mulwray, can and does get away with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4381">The ending of the film shows Noah Cross whisking his daughter/granddaughter into the night after Evelyn Mulwray is killed trying to escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4382">That is Towne’s point of view: “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4389">In 1900, the city of Los Angeles, “a desert community,” as former mayor Bagby reminds us, was growing and expanding so fast it was literally running out of water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4390">If the city was to survive, it had to find another source of water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4391">L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4392">is right next door to the Pacific Ocean. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4393">“You can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail on it, but you can’t drink it, you can’t water your lawns with it, and you can’t irrigate an orange grove with it,” Bagby argues.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4394">The closest water to L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4395">is the Owens River, located in the Owens Valley, a green and fertile area about 250 miles northeast of Los Angeles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4396">A group of businessmen, community leaders, and politicians—some would call them “men of vision”—saw the need for water and conceived a marvelous scheme. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4397">They would buy up the river rights to the Owens River, by force if necessary, then buy up all that worthless land in the San Fernando Valley, about 20 miles outside L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4398">Then they would place a bond issue on the ballot that would fund building an aqueduct from the Owens Valley across 250 miles of blazing desert and jagged foothills to the San Fernando Valley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4399">Then they would turn around and sell the now “fertile” land of the San Fernando Valley to the city of Los Angeles for an enormous sum of money, about $300 million.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4400">That was the plan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4401">The government knew about it, the newspapers knew about it, the local politicians knew about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4402">When the time was right, the authorities would “influence” the people of Los Angeles to pass the proposed bond issue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4403">In 1906, Los Angeles was in the middle of a drought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4404">Things got bad, then worse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4405">People were forbidden to wash their cars or water their lawns; they couldn’t flush their toilets more than a few times a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4406">The city dried up; flowers died, lawns turned brown, and scare headlines declared, “Los Angeles is dying of thirst!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4407">and “Save our city!”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4408">To underscore the drastic need for water during the drought and to make certain the citizens passed the bond issue, the Department of Water and Power dumped thousands of gallons of water into the ocean.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4409">When it came time to vote, the bond issue passed easily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4410">The Owens Valley aqueduct took several years to complete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4411">When it was finished, William Mulholland, then head of the Department of Water and Power, turned the water over to the city: “There it is,” he said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4412">“Take it.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4413">Los Angeles flourished and grew like wildfire; the Owens Valley withered and died. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4414">No wonder it was called the Rape of the Owens Valley.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4415">Robert Towne took this scandal from 1906 and used it as the backdrop in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4416">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4417">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4418">He changed the time period from the turn of the century to 1937, when the visual elements of Los Angeles had the classic and distinctive look of Southern California.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4419">The water scandal that Noah Cross (how appropriate his name) conceives and executes, the crime that causes the deaths of Hollis Mulwray, Leroy the drunk, Ida Sessions, and finally Evelyn Mulwray, the scandal that Jake Gittes uncovers, is woven with great subtlety and skill through the entire screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4420">And Noah Cross gets away with murder.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4421">All this is established and set up on page 8, when Gittes is in the council chambers and we hear Bagby arguing that “eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the deserts from our streets—and not on top of them.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4422">Hollis Mulwray, the character modeled on William Mulholland, replies that the dam site is unsafe, as proven by the previous Van der Lip Dam disaster, and says, “I won’t build it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4423">It’s that simple—I am not making that kind of mistake twice.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4424">By refusing to build the dam, Hollis Mulwray becomes a target for murder; he is an obstacle that must be eliminated.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4425">Again, on page 10, the dramatic question of the screenplay is raised: “You steal the water from the Valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock,” yells the farmer who invades the chambers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4426">“Who’s paying you to do that, Mr. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4427">Mulwray, that’s what I want to know!”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4428">So does Gittes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4429">It is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4430">the</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4431"> question that propels the story to its final resolution, and it is all </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4432">set up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4433"> from the very beginning, in the first ten pages, and moves forward in a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4434">linear</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4435"> direction to the end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4436">“Either you bring the water to L.A., or you bring L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4437">to the water,” Noah Cross tells Gittes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4438">That is the foundation of the entire story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4439">That’s what makes it so great.</span></p>

<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4452">A few years ago I was given the opportunity of working with the writer Joe Eszterhas in a complicated legal case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4453">Called as an expert witness, I was engaged to go through the entire work of this noted screenwriter, analyze the material, and then, in outline form, lay out “the structural essence” of his screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4454">In other words, what was it that made Joe Eszterhas’s material so singular and unique; what made Joe Eszterhas “Joe Eszterhas”?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4455">It was a daunting and intriguing assignment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4456">I didn’t know what to do or how to begin, except to begin at the beginning, by reading his screenplays and noting the similarities and distinctions in the creation of Eszterhas’s style.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4457">As I began reading and analyzing his work, I became aware of several factors that seemed to make his scripts so powerful, whether they were action-thrillers like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4458">Basic Instinct, Jagged Edge, Jade</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4459">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4460">Sliver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4461">, or dramatic and contemporary pieces like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4462">Music Box, Flashdance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4463">, and even the ill-wrought </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4464">Showgirls</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4465">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4466">In all his work I saw he was dealing with real people in real situations, and his characters were interesting, tough, with a sense of bravado that covered a deep well of insecurity and sometimes a lack of self-respect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4467">For instance, the Jennifer Beals character in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4468">Flashdance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4469"> had a sense of creative and defiant confidence within her that engaged reader and audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4470">And there was the music, of course, woven into the story of the girl who overcame all odds—physical, mental, and emotional—to achieve her dream. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4471">A steelworker by day and a pole dancer by night, she had a visual appeal to a vast moviegoing audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4472">The film was an enormous hit.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4473">As I began to get more familiar with Joe Eszterhas’s scripts, I noticed that he thrust the reader and audience into the story line immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4474">In most cases, he began his stories with an action sequence that plunged the main character directly into the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4475">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4476">Basic Instinct</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4477">, the first words of the script—“It is dark; we don’t see clearly”—set the tone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4478">The visual directions continue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4479">“A man and woman make love on a brass bed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4480">There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4481">On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4482">A tape deck PLAYS the Stones: ‘Sympathy for the Devil.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4483">”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4484">It is a graphic, wild, and erotic sex scene, the tempo tight and passion high; as it builds in rhythm, the words get shorter and shorter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4485">“He is inside her…arms tied above him…on his back…eyes closed…she moves…grinding…he strains for her…his head arches back…his throat white…she arches her back…her hips grind…her breasts are high…” and then, at the height of the sexual frenzy, “Her back arches back…back…her head tilts back…she extends her arms…her right arm comes down suddenly…the steel flashes…his throat is white…he bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses…” and the ice pick flashes up and down, “and up…and down…and up…and….”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4486">When I first read this opening scene I was totally riveted, focused, eager to continue reading and see what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4487">The more I read, the more I was hooked. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4488">I had been attracted, engaged, and totally captured by the visual action of the first page.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4489">It’s a perfect example of what I call a visual “grabber,” an opening that grabs you by the throat and seizes your attention. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4490">What better elements can you open a screenplay with than intense passion, wild sex, horrific murder, and visual mayhem, set to the music of The Stones, to boldly establish the style and tone of an entire screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4491">It’s just a great opening.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4492">The next morning, the main character, Nick Curran (Michael Douglas), a tough, hard-nosed, cynical cop with too many years on the force for his relatively youthful age, investigates the crime scene along with his partner and learns that the likely suspect, Catherine (Sharon Stone), is a smart, beautiful, and accomplished novelist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4493">And while he questions her, Nick is immediately attracted as she daringly flaunts her sexuality at him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4494">It’s easy to see why he’s smitten and intrigued by her, and we know the temptation she offers is going to hook him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4495">It doesn’t take too long before he becomes so infatuated with her that he can’t listen to his voice of reason, or his associates’ warnings, as he plunges headlong into a tumultuous affair that costs him his job and may wind up costing him his life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4496">I began to understand that this opening sex/murder scene is the incident that sets the story in motion and directly draws the main character into the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4497">The murder is committed to grab our attention and show us the reason Nick is called upon to investigate the crime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4498">When he leaves the scene of the crime, we follow him and his partner and begin to learn more about this man and the choices he makes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4499">The opening scene and the story that’s going to unfold are directly linked.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4500">This incident—the murder—and the story of a cop giving in to his temptations epitomize the illumination of character and incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4501">Remember Henry James: “What is character but the determination of incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4502">And what is incident but the illumination of character?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4503">You can’t reveal a character dramatically (or comedically) unless you have him/her react to a particular incident; the nature of drama, after all, is to show the universal connection between all humans, regardless of race, color, gender, or cultural differences.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4504">The incident of the murder leads directly to the infatuation Nick feels for Catherine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4505">And that attraction is reinforced when the police question Catherine as the prime suspect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4506">There is a relationship between these two incidents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4507">One incident, the opening sex/murder, is called the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4508">inciting incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4509">, because it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4510">sets the story in motion;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4511"> it is the first visual representation of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4512">key incident, what the story is about</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4513">, and draws the main character into the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4514">Remember the definition of incident: “a specific event or occurrence that occurs in relation to something else.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4515">When I understood this connection, it was almost a revelation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4516">Using an opening sequence to draw the main character into the story line is pure cinema. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4517">From here on through the rest of the screenplay, the story is set up, the characters and premise are established, and there is a story line, a direction to follow—and all because of the connection between these two incidents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4518">This new understanding gave me another tool to use in the craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4519">I went back through all of Eszterhas’s scripts and began to examine his screenplays, focusing on how he wrote and structured opening scenes or sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4520">And I saw, in most cases, that the opening scene, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4521">inciting incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4522">, was a cinematic tool he used to set up the story from page one, word one.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4523">I began to see that in certain kinds of movies—action films, action-thrillers, mysteries, action-adventures, sci-fis, even dramas—writers structure their stories so that this opening, the inciting incident, serves two distinct functions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4524">First, it grabs or hooks the audience immediately—just look at the opening scenes or sequences of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4525">The Matrix, Jaws, Cold Mountain, The Bridges of Madison County, American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4526">, and other films, and you’ll see that this opening scene or sequence is what sets the entire story in motion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4527">For example, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4528">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4529">, a squad of policemen confronts Trinity, and as we watch her defy all known laws of physics and gravity, leaping over buildings to escape, we are drawn into a world of cyberspace that grabs our attention immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4530">The inciting incident anchors us to the edge of our seats, and lets us know that we’re in for an incredible adventure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4531">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4532">Jaws</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4533">, the late-night beach party and a nude swimming lark turn into a horrifying experience as the great white attacks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4534">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4535">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4536">, Union troops burrow underground and plant explosives beneath the Confederate camp; when the charge is detonated the result illustrates the total madness of war, just as in the classic </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4537">The Bridge on the River Kwai</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4538"> (Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4539">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4540">The Bridges of Madison County</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4541"> (Richard LaGravenese), after the death of Francesca (Meryl Streep), her two grown children are going through her things and uncover a hidden diary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4542">As they read, they discover that their mother had a love affair with a man named Robert (Clint Eastwood) many years earlier. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4543">The story of that affair becomes the entire movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4544">Discovering the diary, which sets the story in motion, is the inciting incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4545">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4546">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4547">, we see the “dead” life of Lester Burnham as he begins another day of remorse, regret, and failed dreams. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4548">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4549">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4550">, we see Honey Bunny and Pumpkin discuss holding up the restaurant; when they pull out their guns we freeze the action and cut away to Jules and Vincent, driving to their assignment, recovering a briefcase for Marcellus Wallace. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4551">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4552">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4553">, we open with the history of the ring, then watch as Bilbo Baggins finds it at the bottom of the river. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4554">This is the inciting incident that sets the entire trilogy in motion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4555">I could cite example after example of the inciting incident, but what I feel is most important is the understanding that this incident serves two important and necessary functions in the craft of storytelling: (1), it sets the story in motion; and (2), it grabs the attention of the reader and audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4556">Seeing the relationship between this first incident and the story line is essential to an understanding of good screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4557">The next time you go to a movie, or watch one on DVD or on television, see if you can identify the inciting incident and notice how it sets things in motion. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4558">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4559"> is one of my favorite examples. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4560">In the opening sequence, a CNN news reporter is stationed on the deck of a French aircraft carrier and shows us actual newsreel footage of Russian rebels forcefully occupying the Kremlin in an attempt to take over the government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4561">We then cut to a shot of the rebel leader stating emphatically that the rebel forces will not tolerate any U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4562">intervention and, having occupied a Russian nuclear base, feel no hesitation in launching a nuclear missile attack against the United States. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4563">Then we cut to a TV screen, with Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) and Weps (Viggo Mortensen) watching the news story during a birthday party for Ron’s three-year-old daughter.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4564">Why is this the inciting incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4565">Because it sets the story in motion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4566">(It’s also a good illustration of the Henry James quote.) </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4567">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4568"> is constructed around the way two people see the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4569">In response to the Russian rebel threat, a U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4570">submarine, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4571">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4572">, carrying live nuclear warheads, is sent out as a precautionary measure—either launch a “first-strike” missile or retaliate against Russian missiles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4573">The Captain (Gene Hackman) believes that “war is an extension of politics,” and it is his duty to carry out his orders even if it means a nuclear holocaust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4574">Ron, the executive officer, on the other hand, believes that because of nuclear weapons, war is an outmoded concept. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4575">The purpose of war, he says, is to win, and if both sides launch nuclear weapons, there will be no winner, only losers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4576">War, he believes, is no longer a viable option.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4577">That’s when the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4578">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4579"> receives orders to launch a first-strike nuclear attack against the Russians rebels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4580">As they are preparing to launch the weapons, the men on the submarine receive another emergency message that is cut off before the entire text can be transmitted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4581">What do these second orders say? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4582">Should they continue to follow the first orders and launch a first strike? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4583">Or will they delay the launch to confirm or deny the first order?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4584">These two differing points of view, these two belief systems, generate the conflict that drives the script forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4585">Both points of view are right within the framework of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4586">There is no right and wrong here, no good or bad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4587">Hegel, the great eighteenth-century German philosopher, maintained that the essence of tragedy derives not from one character being right and the other being wrong, or from the conflict of good versus evil, but from a conflict in which </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4588">both characters are right</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4589">, and thus the tragedy is one of “right against right,” being carried to its logical conclusion.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4681">Of course, he is pathetic, but Lester’s reawakening is the key incident in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4682">To show this we cut to Lester lying awake in the glow of his fantasy, watching, in his mind’s eye, Angela beckoning to him on a carpet of rose petals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4683">He says, “I feel like I’ve been in a coma for about twenty years and I’m just now waking up.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4684">His journey into “life” is about to begin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4685">How he does this and the changes and obstacles he confronts are what this story is all about.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4689">The key incident is what literally spins Lester’s life around in another direction and initiates his emotional journey, his transformation from despair to happiness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4690">In this case, the key incident and Plot Point I happen to be the same thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4691">There are times when this happens, and other times when it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4692">The inciting incident and the key incident are related, but not always in the same way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4693">It all depends on the story you’re telling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4694">There are no magic formulas in screenwriting.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4828">I thought that was odd; who puts a Table of Contents in a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4829">It states very clearly that the film is broken down into five individual parts: Part I, the Prologue; Part II, Vincent Vega and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife; Part III, The Gold Watch; Part IV, The Bonnie Situation; and Part V, the Epilogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4830">As I studied the script, I saw that all three stories really bounce off the key incident: Jules and Vincent retrieving Marcellus Wallace’s briefcase from the four kids. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4831">I saw that this one incident was really the hub of all three stories, and noticed that each story is structured as a whole, in linear fashion; it starts at the beginning of the action, goes into the middle, then proceeds to the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4832">Each section is like a short story, presented from a different character’s point of view.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4833">Thinking in terms of “three stories about one story” allowed me to see the film as one unified whole. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4834">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4835"> is three stories surrounded by a prologue and an epilogue, what screenwriters call a bookend technique. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4836">The Bridges of Madison County, Sunset Boulevard</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4837"> (Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4838">Saving Private Ryan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4839">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4840">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4841"> use this technique as well.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4842">The Prologue sets up Pumpkin and Honey Bunny in a coffee shop discussing various types of small-time robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4843">It sets the first and last stories in motion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4844">When the two finish their meal, they pull out their guns and announce the robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4845">The film freezes and we cut to the main titles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4846">Then we cut into the middle of a dialogue between Jules (Samuel L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4847">Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) as they are driving, having an enlightening discussion about the relative merits of a Big Mac here and abroad.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4848">This little exchange sets up their characters, and when they stop and pull out their weapons we see the contradiction between their words and their actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4849">It literally sets up the film and tells us everything we need to know: The two men are killers working for Marcellus Wallace; their job, their dramatic need, is to retrieve the briefcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4850">That’s the true beginning of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4851">In Part I, Jules and Vincent arrive, state their position, reclaim the briefcase, then kill three of the four guys they encounter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4852">It’s only by the grace of God they’re not killed themselves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4853">Only one other person, Marvin, survives, at least for the moment.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4865">It became very clear that no matter what form a film takes, whether linear or nonlinear, there is always going to be an inciting incident and a key incident. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4866">Kill Bill I</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4867"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4868">II</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4869"> is based entirely on the key incident of the story—the killing of The Bride’s (Uma Thurman’s) wedding party—and like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4870">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4871"> is driven by the theme of revenge and unfolds in a novelistic way, complete with a Table of Contents and individual chapters, one of the interesting changes happening in the form right now.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4872">Structuring a nonlinear movie means defining each part, then structuring each section, whether in present time or past time, from beginning to end, at which point the screenwriter can build and arrange the parts in any order he or she desires. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4873">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4874"> (Patrick Sheane Duncan) is a good example of this, as is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4875">Groundhog Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4876"> (Danny Rubin, Harold Ramis), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4877">The Usual Suspects, The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4878">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4879">Sliding Doors</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4880"> (Peter Howitt). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4881">These screenplays are introduced with the inciting incident, then structured around the key incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4882">Take a look at any of these films and see if you can identify and make the distinction between the inciting incident and the key incident.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4883">In my screenwriting workshops, I have my students focus on and define these two incidents before they write one word of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4884">Once they know what the incidents are, they can fuse the action, characters, and events into a structured line of dramatic action, whether using a linear or nonlinear story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4885">It’s important to remember that structure is not something embedded in concrete, or something that is unbending, or unyielding; rather, it is flexible, like a tree that bends in the wind but doesn’t break. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4886">Understanding this concept allows you to play with the plotline so you can tell your stories visually, with narrative action rather than explanation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4887">This is a relatively new shift in the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4888">It wasn’t too long ago that characters had to explain who they were, what their background was, and what their motivation or purpose was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4889">Things were explained through the character’s dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4890">As a matter of fact, explaining their story line through dialogue was one of the chief problems that aspiring screenwriters had when writing their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4891">But there is a new generation of young people growing up with television, wireless technology, and PlayStation, and it’s pretty obvious their visual sense is heightened; as a result, we’re expanding the craft with stories that are more visual, while unfolding with clarity and simplicity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4892">It is a clear sign of evolution at work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4893">But though the form may be evolving, the simple tools of storytelling remain the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4894">What you write is just as important as how you write it.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4979">The thrust of the script moves relentlessly forward from Plot Point to Plot Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4980">As a matter of fact, the characters’ arc and the arc of the story line impact each other, so that each physical incident reveals a different aspect of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4981">Foxx’s cabbie goes through a strong dramatic arc: from passive wimp to man of action; from dreamer to achiever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4982">And the irony, of course, is that Max is forced into these changes by the villain of the piece; when Cruise destroys his old life, Foxx is forced to grab the new.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4983">The script opens with Vincent arriving at LAX and exchanging a black bag with an unknown accomplice; then we cut to and set up Max cleaning his taxi as he readies himself for the night shift. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4984">He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith)—the inciting incident—and during the ride downtown they develop an easygoing familiarity, an attraction, for each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4985">He delivers Annie to the Federal Building, and as she gets out she tells him she’s a prosecutor working an “all-nighter” on a big case and gives Max her card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4986">He picks up another fare, Vincent, who hires him for the night to make the five stops to get “signatures” on a real estate deal he’s closing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4987">So far, it’s just another night in L.A.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4988">As Vincent and Max banter about the state of L.A., they get to know each other a little more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4989">They make stop number one, and Max is waiting in the alley behind the building when suddenly there’s a loud crash and a dead body plunges onto the front windshield. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4990">Shocked, stunned, disbelieving, Max is astonished to learn that Vincent killed the man, though the hit man claims “it was the bullet and the fall that killed him.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4991">That’s Plot Point I, the key incident of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4992">This is the incident that sets in motion the entire screenplay, because Max is now forced against his will to drive Vincent to his other “appointments.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4993">He’s virtually a prisoner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4994">Now, the true story begins.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4995">Two physical actions are going on in this story: (1), Max trying to escape from Vincent as they roam through the city; and (2), Vincent doing his job and honoring his contracts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4996">As they make their appointed rounds, we watch Max reacting to the physical action by going through an emotional change that, step by step, leads to his transformation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4997">In the beginning, he’s passive and weak, a wimp, afraid to stand up to his boss at the cab company. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4998">Then he begins to gain a little courage and tries to escape, but winds up watching helplessly as Vincent kills two guys trying to rip off his briefcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4999">They make a “random” visit to a nightclub, ostensibly to listen to some good jazz, but in fact it’s a cover for Vincent to score his next hit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5000">This is a nice touch, setting us up to expect one thing, then turning it around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5001">Then Max is made to visit his mother at the hospital, and once again tries to escape by running away with Vincent’s briefcase and, in defiance, tossing it onto the freeway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5002">His attitude, his strength, is beginning to emerge; he’s starting to stand up for himself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5003">After the briefcase episode Vincent forces Max, as a sort of punishment or test, to pose as him and meet Felix, the crime boss, to get the new information about the last two hits of the night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5004">Max, in a tense and dramatic moment, rustles up his strength, threatens Felix, and manages to walk out of the meeting alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5005">This is another incident where the physical action triggers an emotional response.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5006">The cops, who think Max is the hit man responsible for all these murders, follow him to a nightclub, and there, on a crowded dance floor, there is a violent shoot-out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5007">Max tries to get away, and when he is spotted by a cop who believes in his innocence, he’s hustled off to safety. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5008">When Vincent sees him with the cop, however, the hit man kills the cop and “rescues” Max.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5009">There’s one more hit for Vincent to fulfill. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5010">At this point, two things are left unresolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5011">One, how is Max going to get away from Vincent alive? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5012">And two, how is he going to prevent Vincent’s last hit? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5013">Racing away from the big shoot-out at the nightclub, Vincent says that Max’s dream of starting a limo company is only a dream, a “someday” excursion into a fantasy that will never happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5014">Max, for the first time, realizes that he has been living a dream for twelve years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5015">Now his dream shattered, and knowing he’ll probably be killed by Vincent when this ordeal is over, he decides to give it all up and live for the moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5016">Otherwise, “What’s the point?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5017">It is this insight that gives him the strength to put his foot on the gas for a wild speed run through the streets of L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5018">He loses control of the wheel and crashes the car, hitting a divider. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5019">The car leaps into the air, hits the ground with a tremendous crash, and rolls. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5020">Plot Point II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5021">Vincent crawls out of the torn and twisted wreckage, and runs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5022">Max manages to crawl out of the overturned taxi, sees a picture of Annie, the woman he met earlier that evening, and realizes that she is the last victim on Vincent’s list. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5023">Which happens to be the reason why Vincent was at the Federal Building in the first place: She was supposed to be his first hit of the night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5024">Max races on foot to warn Annie, and then we go into a chase sequence that ends the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5025">These two Plot Points anchor the story in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5026">Plot Point I is the true beginning of the story: the first murder and Max’s realization that Vincent is responsible for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5027">At Plot Point II, he crashes the car and stands up to Vincent, ready to kill him if need be, in order to save Annie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5028">Each Plot Point is geared by both the emotional and physical forces working on the character; the outside events affect the interior, emotional life of the character and move the script to its next level of action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5029">Once again, a Plot Point is a function of the main character and moves the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5030">It amps up the action and underscores the arc of the character: Vincent is a cynical, amoral person with no values of right and wrong; he’s merely doing a job, and he’s very good at it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5031">He views the world and everyone in it as “a cosmic accident,” the product of random chance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5032">There’s no meaning or significance to our lives because we’re nothing more than an infinitesimal speck of dust in the vast universe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5033">If there’s no meaning to our existence, then our lives mean nothing, so taking a human life has little consequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5034">As Tolstoy said, without God, without a moral system of right and wrong, “anything is permissible.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5035">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5036"> is a very good example of how Plot Points hook into the story line and move it forward, influencing both the emotional and physical arc of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5037">The choices your characters make may very well determine the course and outcome of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5038">The interplay between Max and Vincent and the choices they make bind them together in a unique and unusual situation that expresses the story’s dynamic in a visual, suspenseful way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5039">The connections and interplay between the characters, of course, are essential to the movement and plotline of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5040">Let’s take another look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5041">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5042">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5043">As a mystery-detective story, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5044">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5045"> is structured from Plot Point to Plot Point, each Plot Point carefully moving the action forward from the beginning, when Gittes is hired by the phony Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5046">Mulwray, to the end, when Evelyn Mulwray is killed.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5114">Gittes investigates, but is attacked by farmers who think he’s the man who’s been poisoning their water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5115">When he regains consciousness, Evelyn Mulwray is there—called by the farmers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5116">As they drive back to L.A., Gittes discovers that one of the names in the obituary column mentioned by Ida Sessions is cited as being the owner of a large parcel of land in the Valley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5117">Strange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5118">He died at a place called the Mar Vista Home for the Aged. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5119">Together, Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray drive to the retirement home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5120">Gittes learns that most of the new owners of the land parcels in the Valley are living at the home, unaware of their purchases. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5121">It’s phony—the whole thing’s a giant scam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5122">As they’re leaving, his suspicions confirmed, thugs attack him, but Evelyn drives up, steps on the gas, Gittes jumps on the running board, and they manage to get away.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5123">These incidents, episodes, and events are all Plot Points, all story progressions that move the story forward.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5124">Back at her house, Evelyn cleans Gittes’s nose wound (for being “too nosy”); he notices something in her eye, a slight color defect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5125">He leans over and kisses her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5126">They have sex.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5127">Afterward, they lie in bed making small talk.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5128">The phone rings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5129">She answers it, suddenly becomes agitated, hangs up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5130">She tells Gittes he must leave. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5131">Immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5132">“Something important” has come up.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5133">At this point in the story, we still don’t know two things: (1) who the girl was who was with Mulwray in the beginning before he was murdered; and (2) who set up Gittes, and why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5134">Gittes knows that the answers to the two questions are related. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5135">There’s a good chance that whoever killed Mulwray set him up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5136">Why, we don’t know yet.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5137">Something has come up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5138">What? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5139">Gittes wants to find out, so he tails Evelyn to a house in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5140">When he returns to Evelyn’s house, he discovers a pair of bifocals in the bottom of the fish pond. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5141">He returns to the Echo Park house and confronts Evelyn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5142">She tells him the girl is her sister, then says she’s her daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5143">Gittes slaps her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5144">“I want the truth,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5145">He slaps her again, and she finally confesses that the girl is “my daughter </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5146">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5147"> my sister.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5148">At fifteen, she was the victim of incest, and now cares for her daughter and refuses to speak to her father, Noah Cross. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5149">So, now we know who the girl is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5150">The second point: Who wore the bifocals, victim or killer? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5151">Once Gittes learns the truth, he wants to help Evelyn get away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5152">But before he leaves, at the end of the scene, in what seems to be a throwaway line, she tells Gittes that her husband did not wear bifocals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5153">There is only one conclusion: The glasses were worn by the killer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5154">Now Gittes knows the truth: Noah Cross had a motive for murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5155">It is the final answer he’s seeking and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5156">Resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5157">, the solution of the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5158">Gittes calls Noah Cross and tells him he has “the girl,” and to meet him at Evelyn’s house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5159">And here Gittes learns that the man responsible for the death of Mulwray and the others, the man responsible for the entire water scandal, is Noah Cross. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5160">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5161">“Because it’s the future, Mr. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5162">Gittes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5163">The future.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5164">The way to create it, Cross says, is simple: “Either you bring the water to L.A., or you bring L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5165">to the water.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5166">That’s the dramatic hook of the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5167">And it works, beautifully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5168">The premise that money, power, and influence are corruptive forces is established; as Gittes says: “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5169">If you’ve got enough money and power, you can get away with anything—even murder.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5170">Gittes, now a prisoner, is taken to Chinatown so that Cross can claim his daughter/granddaughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5171">When Evelyn dies at the end of the film, Cross spirits his daughter/granddaughter away, and does indeed get away with murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5172">Ironically, the incident that drove Gittes off the police force in Chinatown has repeated itself: “I tried to help someone and all I ended up doing was hurting them,” he had said earlier.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5173">Full circle, turn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5174">Gittes can’t deal with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5175">He has to be restrained; the last words of the script are forged in filmic consciousness: “Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5176">The Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II are there to hook in the action and spin it around in another direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5177">They are the hub of the story progression, amp the story up to the next level, and move it forward to its dramatic resolution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5178">As a simple exercise, the next time you go to the movies or watch a film on DVD or cable (without commercial breaks), see if you can locate the Plot Points at the end of Act I and Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5179">Every film you see will have definite Plot Points; all you have to do is find them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5180">If you want, take a look at your watch anywhere from twenty to thirty minutes into the film (depending on its length, of course) and see if you can determine what the action point is; ask yourself what’s happening, or what’s going on in the story around this point in the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5181">There will be some kind of incident, episode, or event that will occur. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5182">Discover </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5183">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5184"> it is, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5185">when</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5186"> it occurs.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5198">Let’s take a look at the Plot Points in a couple of other films: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5199">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5200"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5201">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5202">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5206">We’re looking for the Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5207">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5208">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5209">, the opening scene shows us that this is no ordinary action sequence of flying fists, fired shots, and a few explosions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5210">This is a totally unique sequence; it pits Trinity, a lone woman, against several armed policeman, all wearing bulletproof vests. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5211">Right before our eyes, in the most amazing physical feats, Trinity leaps up, is suspended in midair, then runs up walls and across ceilings in order to escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5212">She leaps from rooftop to rooftop, building to building, totally disregarding gravity as she flies through the air to reach the other side. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5213">From there, it’s a race against a huge garbage truck to reach the ringing telephone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5214">She makes it in the nick of time and answers the phone just as the truck slams into the telephone booth.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5215">Whoa…if that’s not a grabber, I don’t know what is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5216">In terms of information, we don’t know who Trinity is, whether she’s a “good guy” or a “bad guy,” nor do we know what the story’s about, or how she managed to escape the way she did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5217">But as an opening this inciting incident certainly grabs our attention.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5218">At this point, we don’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5219">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5220"> the story is about or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5221">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5222"> it’s about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5223">We need some exposition here, defined as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5224">the information needed to move the story forward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5225">, and that’s exactly what we get next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5226">Neo, the main character, wakes up to the words “Follow the white rabbit” on his computer screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5227">There’s a knock on the door; it’s a girl with a white rabbit tattooed on her shoulder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5228">He follows her to a club. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5229">There he meets Trinity and asks her about the Matrix. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5230">But she doesn’t explain anything; she only warns him that he’s in danger: “They’re watching you.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5231">And, she stresses, “The truth is out there, Neo, and it’s looking for you and will find you, if you want it to.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5232">Then she’s gone.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5233">What is the Matrix? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5234">Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) explains later that we’re inhabiting a parallel universe and the Matrix is a state of virtual reality, an illusion that we’ve all been programmed to accept as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5235">real</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5236">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5237">The truth, the “real” world, has been destroyed and re-created by a race of machines, artificial intelligence, and computers into a form of virtual reality.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5238">So begins the heroes’ journey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5239">Morpheus, the rebel leader, is dedicated to waging war against the Matrix to reveal “the truth,” liberating humanity from the bondage of the machines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5240">Morpheus believes in the prophecy that their only hope of winning is by finding “The One,” a human being endowed with godlike powers who will lead them in their war of liberation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5241">And he believes Neo is “The One.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5242">As Morpheus tells Neo, the mind and body are intertwined, and even though they are separate entities, if you can control your mind you can control reality, and thus control your destiny.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5243">That’s an ancient teaching from Eastern philosophy, brought into a contemporary situation, futuristic in thought and execution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5244">Neo, like Hamlet or the warrior Arjuna in the classic Indian tale the Bhagavad Gita, must choose his own destiny. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5245">This theme of choice, of choosing the reality you wish to inhabit, is a recurring motif throughout the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5246">When Neo goes to work the next day, he is told he has to make a choice: to either be Thomas Anderson by day, or Neo, the self-styled rebel, his true self, by night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5247">When he gets to his office, Neo receives a package and a cell phone pops out, ringing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5248">Morpheus is on the line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5249">He tells Neo, “They’re after you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5250">There are only two ways for you to leave the building—either you choose to leave by the scaffolding hanging outside the window, or you choose to leave as a prisoner.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5251">Like Hamlet and Arjuna, Neo embodies the stance of the reluctant hero: Before he can rise to another, higher level of consciousness, he must first accept himself and his destiny.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5252">He leaves as a prisoner, and is later wired, a bug planted deep within him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5253">Trinity and the others pick Neo up under the bridge, but only after he is “debugged” will he be taken to meet Morpheus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5254">This fusion of the ancient and the futuristic is embodied in the various names used in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5255">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5256">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5257">The rebel ship, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5258">Nebuchadnezzar</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5259">, for example, is named after the famed Babylonian king of the fifth century B.C. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5260">who is credited with tearing down and rebuilding the ancient temples; so he’s both a destroyer and builder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5261">The name fits the ship’s destiny, for it houses the small rebel band determined to destroy the Matrix. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5262">In Greek mythology </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5263">Morpheus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5264"> is the god of Sleep, responsible for weaving the fabric of our dreams in the deep sleep state. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5265">Neo</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5266">, of course, means “new,” and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5267">Trinity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5268"> has several religious implications. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5269">These mythological echoes are simply a way of adding more insight and dimension to the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5270">At this point, the story progresses by action and explanation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5271">Only when Neo can accept being “The One” can he really </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5272">be</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5273"> “The One.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5274">In other words, what we believe to be true, is true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5275">And this sets up Plot Point I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5276">He has his first face-to-face meeting with Morpheus at Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5277">During the meeting, the key incident, Morpheus offers Neo a choice: Either take the Blue Pill and get ordinary reality or take the Red Pill and get the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5278">Neo doesn’t hesitate—he takes the red one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5279">Reality distorts as he falls between the corridors of virtual reality and the netherworld. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5280">In a sequence as bizarre and evocative as an H. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5281">R. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5282">Giger painting, Neo is reborn as a man freed from the restraints of his limited mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5283">As the embryo of himself, Neo must retrain both his body and his mind until he is capable of exploring the untapped resources of his unlimited self as seen in martial arts contests with Morpheus.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5284">Plot Point I is the true beginning of the story; it is the incident that hooks into the action and spins it around into Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5285">The context of Act II is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5286">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5287">, so Neo encounters obstacle after obstacle to achieve his dramatic need: to know the Matrix and to be self-realized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5288">Plot Point I fulfills this function.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5389">“I wanted to show her feelings because she feels responsible for everything that happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5390">She plays a game with him; when he comes back from his trip, she’s not going to be in town, and this is what happens when she’s not being honest.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5391">Not being honest in her relationship leads to what eventually happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5392">It’s not dharmic, meaning it’s not the “right action” based on the moral and ethical principles of the universe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5393">In other words, it’s uncool. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5394">Thelma and Louise go into the bar, order drinks, talk about their relationships. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5395">Then a stranger named Harlan approaches, makes himself comfortable at their table, and starts hustling Thelma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5396">Louise shoos him away, but later he comes back and he and Thelma step onto the dance floor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5397">He plies her with drinks, gets her so dizzy she thinks she’s going to be sick, then takes her outside to the parking lot.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5398">And there, what starts as a “friendly” little kiss turns into a pretty ugly scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5399">He attempts to rape Thelma, and almost gets away with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5400">After slapping her around, he flips up her dress, knocks her legs apart, unzips his pants. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5401">We hear the crunch of gravel, and then a gun enters the frame at his head. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5402">Louise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5403">She tells him to stop, adding, “You’ve got a pretty fucked-up idea of fun.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5404">He mouths off to her and says one thing too much, and Louise “raises the gun, and fires a bullet into his face.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5405">He’s killed instantly.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5406">Plot Point I—the true beginning of the story; the “incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5407">What began as a nice weekend trip to the mountains ends up in an attempted rape and murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5408">From here on out, Thelma and Louise are on the run, and as they race down the highway, like so many other characters in so many other movies, they come to grips with themselves, find out who they really are, and ultimately end up taking responsibility for their lives and actions. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5409">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5410"> is a road movie, yes, but it’s really a journey of enlightenment and self-discovery.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5411">Their dramatic need has changed now and there is no turning back as they race toward Mexico a step ahead of the law. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5412">As they drive through Monument Valley in Utah, Louise stops the car. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5413">In the vast and towering silence, she steps out of the car and drinks in this most memorable sight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5414">She now knows that this might be her last night on Earth, at least in this lifetime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5415">That realization, experienced in total silence, is Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5416">In the next scene, she shares this insight with Thelma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5417">Thelma thanks her for what she did, because Harlan was hurting her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5418">The two women are bonded together in friendship and forgiveness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5419">It’s a beautiful moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5420">In silence, underneath a blanket of stars, in a place that exists beyond time, they accept themselves and their destiny. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5421">For the first time, they understand there may be no way back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5422">The stillness of the scene is the pause before the storm, and the silence works better and more effectively than words ever could.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5423">This little scene is the Plot Point at the end of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5424">It spins the story line into Act III, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5425">Resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5426">, because at this point in the story, we don’t know what’s going to happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5427">Will they get caught or escape safely to Mexico? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5428">More important, will they live or die? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5429">From now on, through the rest of the story line, they resolve their feelings for each other and take full responsibility for their actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5430">From here on, there’s no turning back for Thelma and Louise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5431">There are no options left: It’s death or it’s death.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5432">It should be noted that a Plot Point does not have to be a dramatic moment, or a major scene or sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5433">A Plot Point can be a quiet moment, as in Plot Point II in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5434">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5435">, or an exciting action sequence, as in Plot Point I in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5436">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5437">, or a line of dialogue, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5438">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5439">, or a decision that affects the story line, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5440">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5441">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5442">A Plot Point is whatever you choose it to be—it could be a long scene or a short one, a moment of silence or of action; it simply depends on the script you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5443">It’s the choice of the screenwriter, but it is always an incident, episode, or event that is dictated by the needs of the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5444">Knowledge and mastery of the Plot Point is an essential requirement of writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5445">As you approach the 120 blank sheets of paper, the Plot Points at the end of each act are the anchoring pins of dramatic action; they hold everything together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5446">They are the signposts, the goals, the objectives, the destination points of each act—forged links in the chain of dramatic action.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5679">Generally, there are two kinds of scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5680">One is where something happens </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5681">visually</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5682">, like an action scene—the opening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5683">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5684">, for example, or the battle scenes in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5685">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5686">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5687">The other is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5688">dialogue</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5689"> scene between two or more characters, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5690">Casablanca</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5691">, or the famous “slapping” scene in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5692">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5693">, or the various wonderfully inventive scenes in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5694">The Royal Tenenbaums</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5695"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5696">Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5697">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5698">Most scenes are a combination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5699">In a dialogue scene, there’s usually some action going on, and in an action scene, there’s usually some dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5700">Since one page of screenplay equals approximately one minute of screen time, most dialogue scenes need be no longer than two or three pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5701">That’s two or three minutes of screen time, and believe it or not, that’s an enormous amount of screen time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5702">I had a student once who wrote a seventeen-page dialogue scene in a romantic comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5703">Needless to say, it was way, way too long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5704">I made cuts to the scene and it ended up a little over three and a half pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5705">This is a general rule, of course, and there are always exceptions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5706">There are times when a dialogue scene is highlighted by strong background action, like the scene in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5707">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5708"> where Max drives faster and faster until he crashes the cab into the street barrier.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6157">And then we’re into the aftermath. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6158">Wow! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6159">A virtual assault of words—explosive, fast, visually dynamic, and emotionally insightful; the dialogue is crisp, sharp, and carries us like lightning across the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6160">More than anything, it’s an epiphany for Max. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6161">It’s a grabber, in more ways than one.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6162">The scene starts in the aftermath of the shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6163">It begins surrounded in tension, like an echo of the chaotic shoot-out that preceded it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6164">The strain inside the cab gradually picks up as the car increases speed and Max and Vincent go after each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6165">Max’s choices are few if he hopes to walk away from this nightmare alive.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6166">First, not only is it exciting, filled with friction and suspense, but it illustrates the true purpose of a scene: It </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6167">moves the story forward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6168"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6169">revealing information about the main character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6170">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6171">It does this both physically and emotionally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6172">During the scene, as Max and Vincent race toward downtown, layer after layer of character is stripped away to reveal their personal histories and divergent points of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6173">According to Vincent, we are insignificant here, a tiny speck in the galactic expanse of space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6174">Basically, life is meaningless, with no design, no purpose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6175">The scene is the Plot Point at the end of Act II and leads us into Act III, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6176">Resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6177">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6178">After the car crashes, the only question that remains is simple: Can Max walk away alive, and can he stop Vincent from fulfilling his fifth hit, who, he now learns, is Annie?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6179">The scene </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6180">reveals character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6181">, as Vincent probes and bursts Max’s dream balloon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6182">Up until now, as Vincent says, Max has lived in a dream, in a “someday” state; someday he’s going to fulfill his dream of starting Island Limousine; someday he’s going to meet the woman of his dreams; someday he’ll have it all and be fulfilled as a person. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6183">It’s a pretty big Someday. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6184">Vincent shows him that there is only now, today, this present moment, this point in time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6185">Waiting for “someday” is, like striving for perfection, really just an excuse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6186">“Someday” is a concept that, to quote my mentor, Jean Renoir, “exists only in the mind, not in reality.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6187">What forces are working on these two characters as they engage in their personal duel? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6188">In the nightclub, the hit man, against all odds, has completed his fourth hit, and now Max is driving him toward number five. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6189">Once again, Max is virtually a prisoner, his choices few; either he finds some way to escape safely, Vincent kills him after the final hit is completed, or he manages to kill Vincent.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6190">You’ll notice that this scene is not a simply just another dialogue scene; Max and Vincent are in a speeding taxi, escaping from the frenetic shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6191">So there is an outside, external tension—the police, other cars, helicopters, traffic lights—that impedes their action and becomes a source of conflict, adding tension to the harsh verbal exchange between Max and Vincent.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6192">There’s another thing that’s revealed in this scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6193">In the beginning, Max was portrayed as something of a wimp, a man afraid to stand up to his boss, the cab dispatcher, a man who lives a “someday” dream pictured in a postcard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6194">But he has been transformed, and finally stands up to and confronts his nemesis.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6195">This does not happen spontaneously but has been gradually built up to, step by step, from the beginning of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6196">It is Vincent who stands up to the dispatcher when he gives Max a bad time, and shows Max how to defend himself against his superior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6197">Max gathers enough strength to throw Vincent’s briefcase onto the freeway, ruining it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6198">Then he’s forced to confront the drug warlord, Felix, and walks out alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6199">Though some might say that these elements are too unbelievable to be taken seriously, to my mind, they work effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6200">Now, prompted by Vincent’s prodding, Max has found enough courage to flip the cab, possibly killing himself and Vincent but at least stopping Vincent from completing his last hit of the evening.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6201">In short, this scene, set amid the fury and confusion of the speeding cab, allows us to watch Max’s transformation and ultimately leads to the conclusion of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6202">Max has completed his character arc.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6203">It’s a marvelous scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6204">Do these same principles work with comedy? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6205">Comedy creates a situation, then lets people act and react to the situation and each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6206">In comedy, you can’t have your characters playing for laughs; they have to believe what they’re doing, otherwise it becomes forced and contrived, and therefore unfunny.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6207">Remember the scene at the outdoor restaurant in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6208">Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6209">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6210">Annie (Diane Keaton) tells Alvy (Woody Allen) that she just wants to be his “friend” and not continue their romantic relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6211">Both are uncomfortable, and this adds tension to the scene by heightening the comedic overtones; when he leaves the restaurant he collides with several cars, then tears up his driver’s license in front of a policeman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6212">Woody Allen utilizes the situation for maximum dramatic effectiveness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6213">In the Italian film </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6214">Divorce—Italian Style</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6215">, a classic comedy with Marcello Mastroianni, only a thin line separates comedy from tragedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6216">But, after all, comedy and tragedy are two sides of the same coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6217">Mastroianni is married to a woman who makes enormous sexual demands on him, and he can’t cope with it—especially when he meets a voluptuous young cousin who’s crazy about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6218">He wants a divorce but, alas, the Church won’t recognize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6219">What’s an Italian man to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6220">The only way the Church will recognize the end of his marriage is for his wife to die. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6221">But she’s as healthy as a horse.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6222">So he decides to kill her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6223">But under Italian law, the only way he can kill her with honor and get away with it is if she’s unfaithful; he has to be cuckolded. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6224">So he sets out to find a lover for his wife.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6225">That’s the situation!</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6226">After many, many funny moments, she </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6227">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6228"> unfaithful to him, and his Italian honor demands he take action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6229">He tracks her and her lover to an island in the Aegean Sea and searches for them, gun in hand.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6230">The characters are caught within the web of circumstances and play their roles with exaggerated seriousness, and the result is film comedy at its best. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6231">For in comedy, Woody Allen says, “Acting funny is the worst thing you can do.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6232">Comedy, like drama, depends on “real people in real situations.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6233">When you set out to write a scene, find the purpose of the scene and root it in place and time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6234">Then establish the context and determine the content, and find the elements or components within the scene to build it and make it work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6235">Every scene, like a sequence, or an act, or an entire screenplay, has a definite beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6236">If you break the components of the scene down into beginning, middle, and end, you can establish the bits and pieces of action that are visually effective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6237">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6238">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6239">, we saw the entire scene: the beginning, when Max and Vincent head downtown; the middle, when they exchange conversation; and the end, when Max steps on the gas and flips the car.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6240">You don’t always need to show the entire scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6241">You can choose to show a few parts from the beginning, or just the middle, or maybe only the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6242">Only rarely is a scene depicted in its entirety. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6243">William Goldman, who wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6244">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6245"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6246">All the President’s Men</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6247">, among other films, once remarked that he doesn’t enter the action until the last possible moment—that is, just before the purpose of the scene is revealed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6248">You, as writer, are completely in control of how you create your scenes to move your story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6249">You </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6250">choose</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6251"> what part of the scene you are going to show.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6292">A screenplay is really a system of sorts, comprised of specific parts that are related and unified by action, character, and dramatic premise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6293">We measure it, or evaluate it, in terms of how well it works or doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6294">The screenplay, as a system, is made up of specific elements: endings, beginnings, scenes, Plot Points, shots, special effects, locations, music, and sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6295">Together, unified by the dramatic thrust of action and character, the story elements are arranged in a particular way and then revealed visually to create the totality known as the screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6419">Sometimes, but not always, these four story points are sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6420">You might open your film with a wedding sequence, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6421">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6422">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6423">You might use a sequence like Neo meeting Morpheus and choosing the Red Pill in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6424">The Matrix</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6425"> as the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6426">You might want to write a sequence like Paul Thomas Anderson does in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6427">Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6428">, when nine characters, all in states of deep emotional stress, sing the lyrics of Aimee Mann’s song “Wise Up.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6429">It’s a wonderful illustration of how inventive a sequence can be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6430">You might use a dramatic sequence to end the film, like Gary Ross does in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6431">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6432">, or resolve your script with the performance of a play, like Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson do in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6433">Rushmore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6434">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6435">Sequences can be written any way you want; they are a creative, limitless context within which to paint your picture against the canvas of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6436">It should be noted that there are no specific number of sequences in a screenplay; you don’t need exactly twelve, eighteen, or twenty sequences to make up your script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6437">Your story will tell you how many sequences you need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6438">Frank Pierson conceived and wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6439">Dog Day Afternoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6440"> with just twelve sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6441">He started off with four: the opening, the two Plot Points at the end of Acts I and II, and the ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6442">He added eight sequences throughout the narrative line and built that into a complete screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6451">Most action films are held together by a series of sequences that keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6452">The action genre is a significant staple of our film fare, and if you look at any film company’s production schedules for the upcoming year, you’ll see at least half of its production slate is devoted to the action film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6453">Writing the action film, and the action sequence, is really an art unto itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6454">So many times I read screenplays whose pages are filled with nonstop action—in fact, there is so much action, with little or no characterization, that it becomes dull and repetitive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6455">The reader and viewer become overwhelmed and numb from the onslaught of words and pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6456">Sometimes you can have a good action script with strong individual action sequences, but the premise is weak and derivative of earlier films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6457">It needs a “new look,” or a more interesting concept.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6458">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6459">Because there are problems: with the plot, or the characters, or the action itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6460">Some writers have a natural ability to write action, and others are more comfortable writing character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6461">It’s important to note that before you can write any kind of action film, or action sequence, you must understand what the action film is, what its essential nature is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6462">Once I had a student who wrote a screenplay about a navy pilot sent on a mission to a foreign country to rescue a kidnapped scientist being held hostage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6463">It’s a good premise, and there are several opportunities to create notable action sequences that keep the story moving forward at a fast pace. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6464">That’s what he did, and his entire screenplay was one action sequence after another; the story moved like lightning, but it didn’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6465">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6466">Because he didn’t create an interesting main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6467">And because he didn’t know his main character, most of the dialogue consisted of expository elements designed to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6468">It didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6469">We didn’t know anything about this person sent to rescue the scientist, who he was or where he came from; we had no idea about his thoughts or feelings, or the forces working on his life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6470">This is not all that uncommon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6471">When you’re writing an action screenplay, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6472">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6473"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6474">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6475">, the focus must be on action </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6476">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6477"> character; the two must reside in and interact with each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6478">Otherwise there are going to be problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6479">What usually happens is that the action overpowers the story and diminishes the characters, resulting in a screenplay that, no matter how well written, is flat and uninteresting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6480">There has to be an appropriate balance of peaks and valleys, places in the material where the reader and audience can pause and catch their collective breath.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6544">The key to writing a great action sequence is the way it’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6545">designed</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6546">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6547">A sequence, remember, is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6548">a series of scenes connected by one single idea, with a definite beginning, middle, and end</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6549">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6550">As mentioned, a sequence is a complete entity, held together by one </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6551">single idea:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6552"> a chase sequence, wedding sequence, party sequence, fight sequence, love sequence, storm sequence.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6553">What’s nice about designing a sequence is that you can play with many different elements to make it catchy, exciting, dynamic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6554">One of the things I like the most about Sam Peckinpah as a filmmaker is the way he designs his sequences in what I call “the contradiction of image.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6555">Things we don’t expect begin to play upon and affect the central core of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6556">One of my favorite examples is the opening sequence of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6557">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6558">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6559">It can be described simply: a holdup, or bank robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6560">That’s the context.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6561">The script opens with the outlaws, led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), wearing soldier uniforms and riding into a small town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6562">They pass a group of kids setting fire to a scorpion, a little visual aside about what’s to come.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6563">When the Wild Bunch rides into town, they pass a preacher standing underneath a tent, denouncing the evils of alcohol in an abbreviated Leviticus 10:9: “Do not drink wine or strong drink…least ye die…it biteth itself like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6564">In almost every Peckinpah film, there is some kind of reference to the evils of alcohol. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6565">But of course, he never just throws in a scene like this; he includes it as an integral part of the action that erupts once the Temperance Parade begins.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6566">The stage description sets up Pike’s character immediately.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6567">Pike is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6568">thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing—except the changes in himself and those around him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6569">Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero—his values are not ours—he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank robber, a killer of men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6570">His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys and telegraphs or better schools. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6571">He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6572">….</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6573">Pike’s character reveals his sympathetic side immediately; as the group prepares to enter the bank, he inadvertently bumps into a little old lady and knocks her parcels to the ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6574">Everybody freezes, but with the decorum of a gentleman, Pike picks up the packages, extends his arm, and helps the lady across the street.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6575">The bank robbery does more than just set us up for an action sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6576">Peckinpah sets up his characters and situations in order to illustrate his theme, which is “unchanged men in a changing land.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6577">The relationship between the two main characters, Pike and Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), is established immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6578">In the first scene we see they’ve ridden together, stood by each other, and fought each other; they have a history between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6579">They know that the days of robbing banks and railroads are “closing fast,” and they’re locked into a dead-end future where the only alternatives are death, prison, or living out a meager kind of existence in a small Mexican village.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6580">There are three separate elements in the opening sequence: the holdup, the Temperance Parade, and the scavenger bounty hunters waiting to ambush the Wild Bunch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6581">On a roof across from the bank, the bounty hunters, led by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), have been waiting hours for the Wild Bunch to arrive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6582">The sun is boiling and they’re hot and tired and ornery, but there are large rewards for the capture or killing of the Wild Bunch.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6583">All these elements are set up and established as the holdup begins to unfold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6584">It’s only a matter of time before it all explodes into one kaleidoscopic action sequence.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6585">Integrating these different elements into an action sequence is what places Peckinpah head and shoulders above most other action directors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6586">Inside the bank, Angel, one of the Bunch, notices sunlight on the roof reflecting off rifle barrels across the street. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6587">Pike and Dutch immediately know it’s an ambush, and using the Temperance Parade as a cover they make their break, joining the elderly marchers and children and band members. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6588">That’s when all hell breaks loose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6589">The street becomes a confused melee as bandits run for their horses, bounty hunters open fire, and men, women, and children collide with each other, caught in the crossfire.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6590">It’s an extraordinary sequence that utilizes all the visual components to capture our attention and keep us glued to the edge of our seats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6591">Sometimes, if a script does not seem to be working as well as it should, or you feel there’s a problem in terms of pacing, or things seem dull and boring, you might think about adding some kind of action sequence to keep the story moving and the tension taut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6592">Sometimes you have to make some drastic creative choices to pump up the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6593">If you do, you need to examine the material and see whether the proposed action will blend in with your original concept. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6594">The material has to be designed for and incorporated into your story line, then executed to the best of your ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6595">Often the easy way out—a car chase, or a kiss, or a shoot-out, or a murder attempt—draws attention to itself and therefore doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6596">David Koepp, who wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6597">Spider-Man, Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6598">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6599">The Lost World</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6600">, to name just a few of his credits, says the key to writing a good action sequence is finding more ways to say that someone “runs.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6601">“Action sequences use a lot of verbs,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6602">“Look at the possibilities: He runs to hide behind the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6603">He races over to the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6604">He scrambles over to the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6605">He crawls frantically on his belly over to the rock…Things like that can drive me crazy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6606">Hurries, trots, sprints, dives, leaps, jumps, barrels, slams. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6607">The word </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6608">slams</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6609">, that’ll appear a lot in an action script.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6610">In an action scene, Koepp says, “The reader is sometimes forcing their eyes along because what’s tremendously entertaining to watch on film is not necessarily so thrilling to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6611">I think the challenge is to make that stuff fly by at the pace you would like it to fly by in the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6612">So you’ve constantly got to find ways to make the action sequences readable and easy for the reader to picture in his mind.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6613">So what’s the best way to write an action sequence?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6614">Design it; choreograph the action from the beginning, through the middle, and on to the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6615">Choose your words carefully when you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6616">Action is not written with a lot of long and beautifully styled sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6617">Writing an action sequence has got to be intense, visual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6618">The reader must see the action as if he or she were seeing it on the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6619">But if you write too little, and don’t flesh out the action as much as you should, the action line becomes thin and doesn’t carry the gripping intensity that you must have in a good action sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6620">We’re dealing with moving images that you hope will keep people glued to the edge of their seats, filled with excitement, or fear, or great expectation, locked in that great “community of emotion” that unites everybody in a darkened movie theater. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6621">Just look at some of the great action sequences: the opening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6622">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6623">, the shoot-out in Act III in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6624">Witness</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6625">, the action sequences in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6626">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6627">, the ending of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6628">Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6629">, the final battle sequence in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6630">Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6631">, the last act of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6632">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6633">, the train robbery and final shoot-out in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6634">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6635">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6636">These are all action sequences that have been designed and choreographed with immense care and strict attention to detail.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6637">Here’s an example of an excellent action sequence; it’s lean, clean, and tight, totally effective, extremely visual, and not bogged down with details. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6638">This is a little piece out of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6639">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6640">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6641">The scene takes place on the island off Costa Rica just as it has been hit by a violent tropical storm, and an employee trying to smuggle out dinosaur embryos has shut down the security systems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6642">The two remote-controlled electric cars, one carrying two children and the attorney Gennaro, the other the Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum characters, are stalled next to the massive electric fence that keeps the dinosaurs enclosed in their restricted area. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6643">The power is out all over the island, and the kids are scared. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6644">They wait nervously.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6730">It’s very good writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6731">Sometimes writers will try to cover a weakness in character writing by inserting action sequences, thus avoiding having to characterize. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6732">Sometimes action sequences are written in such detail that any attempt to create a good reading experience is simply lost in the blanket of excess verbiage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6733">Other times you may want to weave a narrative line through a sequence that illuminates the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6734">An excellent example is the “selling the house” sequence in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6735">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6736">, in which Carolyn sets out to sell the house she is showing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6737">What’s great about the sequence is that it has one single line of narrative action, selling the house, shown through a series of attempts, each driving the action of the sequence forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6738">Notice the conflict within the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6739">As said many times before, all drama is conflict; without conflict you have no action; without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6740">And without story, you have no screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6741">The sequence begins with Carolyn’s planting a “For Sale” sign on the front lawn in a middle-class neighborhood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6742">As she unloads her car, she frowns and slams the trunk shut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6743">Inside the house, she unzips to her slip and fiercely starts cleaning, repeating the mantra: “I will sell this house today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6744">I will sell this house today….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6745">She scrubs countertops in the kitchen, strides a stepladder to dust a ceiling fan, cleans glass doors overlooking the backyard pool area, vacuums the carpet, doing whatever needs to be done.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6746">That’s the beginning of the sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6747">The middle starts as she swings open the front door with a glorious smile welcoming the first visitors of the day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6748">“Welcome,” she says, “I’m Carolyn Burnham.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6749">She shows a grim-faced couple the fireplace, leads another unsmiling couple into the kitchen, shows a different couple the bedroom, then shows two mannish women in their thirties the outdoor pool area. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6750">“The ad said this pool was ‘lagoon-like.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6751">There’s nothing ‘lagoon-like’ about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6752">Except for maybe the bugs,” one of the women says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6753">“There’s not even any plants out here.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6754">“I have an excellent landscape architect,” Carolyn replies, but the women aren’t even listening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6755">“I mean, I think ‘lagoon,’ and I think waterfall, I think tropical,” the second woman comments sarcastically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6756">“This is just a cement hole.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6757">To which Carolyn responds, smiling, “I have some tiki torches in the garage.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6758">Notice how the one line of action, showing the house, from living room to kitchen to bedroom to the outside, is a continuous line of action, but illustrated with four different couples, giving the impression that Carolyn has been showing the house the whole day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6759">This single line of action, showing the house, is the subject of the sequence, the context; and the content changes from room to room, couple to couple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6760">In effect, this could be labeled a “montage,” a series of shots strung together to bridge time, place, and action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6761">The sequence concludes with Carolyn, at the end of the day, shutting the vertical blinds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6762">Then, “standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6763">Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6764">‘Stop it,’ she demands to herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6765">But the tears continue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6766">She SLAPS herself again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6767">‘Weak. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6768">Baby. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6769">Shut up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6770">Shut up!’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6771">She SLAPS herself repeatedly until the crying stops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6772">She stands there, taking deep, even breaths until she has everything under control. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6773">Then she finishes pulling the blinds shut, once again all business. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6774">She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6775">Look what we know about her character from this particular sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6776">She fails in her intention, “I will sell this house today”; we’ve seen her working her butt off doing the best job she can, but it’s still not good enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6777">She thinks she has failed, and failure, to her, is a sign of weakness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6778">Then she pulls it all together, wipes the tears away, and strides out as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6779">But look at what we, the reader and audience, get to see: a woman with a low sense of self-esteem and little self-love, who takes failure personally and blames herself for what she is not able to accomplish.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6780">It’s brilliant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6781">And it all comes from a sequence: a series of scenes connected by one single idea, with a definite beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6782">Action and character, joined together, sharpens the focus of your screenplay and makes it both a better reading and a better viewing experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6783">The sequence is a major building block in laying out the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6784">The next step is building your screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6944">This is a simple summary of the action, and not the way the screenplay will look, but it is a process that lays out the story line; it is an effective way in which you can build, or put together, your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6945">Understand that building the screenplay is different from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6946">writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6947"> the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6948">They are two different processes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6949">That’s why I say that one card equals one scene, even though it’s a contradiction when you’re writing the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6950">For example, look at the sequence during which Max visits his mother in the hospital in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6951">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6952">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6953">When you’re building your story line on the cards you may write, “Max visits mother in hospital.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6954">Yet, though we write it on one card, in truth, when we write the screenplay, it might be an entire sequence, a series of scenes connected by one single idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6955">If you look at the film, “Max visiting his mother” is written as a sequence: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6956">Max and Vincent arrive at the hospital; Max visits with his mother, Vincent sweet-talks his mother; Max escapes with Vincent’s bag; Vincent chases him; Vincent confronts him; Max, defiant, throws the bag over the freeway</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6957">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6958">That’s approximately seven scenes (it’s longer in the movie), and it all comes from “Max visiting his mother.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6959">Suppose your character is feeling chest pains, and the story leads him/her to the hospital. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6960">On one card you write “Goes to the hospital.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6961">But when you’re actually writing this card for the screenplay, it may become an entire sequence, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6962">Collateral:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6963"> Your character would arrive at the hospital; the doctors examine him; the lab work is done; various medical tests, like X-rays, an EKG, or an EEG, are conducted; a family member or friend is with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6964">He may be put in a room, or ward, and he may dislike the admitting physician; the doctors might discuss the case with relatives; your character might be even be placed in the intensive care unit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6965">All this can be specified in a few words on the card: “Goes to the hospital.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6966">One scene per card, even though that will probably be a contradiction when you’re writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6967">As my mentor, Jean Renoir, used to say: “Do I contradict myself? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6968">Then I contradict myself.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6969">It’s very important to remember that when you’re doing the cards, you’re doing the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6970">When you’re writing the screenplay, you’re writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6971">One’s an apple, the other’s an orange.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6989">I suggest using fourteen cards per approximately thirty pages of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6990">That means fourteen cards for Act I, fourteen cards for the First Half of Act II, fourteen cards for the Second Half of Act II, and fourteen cards for Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6991">Why fourteen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6992">Because it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6993">Over the years, teaching thousands of students, both here and abroad, I have found I can tell whether a writer has too much material for Act I based on how many cards he/she lays out—strange, but true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6994">If a writer has fifteen or sixteen cards, I can tell immediately that it’s top-heavy; there’s too much material for the act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6995">If there are twelve or thirteen cards, I can tell the material is thin, and the writer needs a few more scenes to flesh it out in terms of character and plot, depth and dimension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6996">Sometimes writers will use eleven or twelve cards and then tell me that they’ll add a few more scenes when they’re writing the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6997">Sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6998">It’s just one of those odd things I’ve discovered out of my experience of teaching and writing screenplays; the cards really become a sort of “psychic” guide to laying out the scenes and sequences you’ll need to build your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6999">Sometimes I’ll use different-colored cards: blue for Act I, green for Act II, and yellow for Act III.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7000">The cards are an incredible method. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7001">You have absolute freedom to change, add, or delete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7002">You can arrange or rearrange them, any way you want, adding some, omitting others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7003">It is simple, easy, and effective and gives you maximum mobility in building your screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7004">Sometimes people want to write down their scenes in outline form on the computer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7005">You know: 1, 2, 3, 4…This does work, but I personally find it very restricting; it’s too hard to move scenes around or rearrange them in a different order if you get a sudden idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7006">Final Draft screenwriting software, in versions 6 and 7, has created a scene card application that lets you write down a card, then rearrange it any way you want. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7007">However, I still like the feel of shuffling the cards around; I find it easier to have the cards in my hands so I can arrange and rearrange them at will. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7008">But do whatever works for you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7009">When you first lay down your story line, I suggest you simply write down all those scenes you know you want included in the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7010">(There’s more about this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7011">The Screenwriter’s Workbook.)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7012"> Just scribble a few words that will identify the scene and throw them down in no real order, free-association style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7013">You already know your beginning and Plot Point I: Cards 1 and 14. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7014">That means you already have two cards, the beginning point and the end point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7015">All you need are twelve more to lay out the action line of Act I.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7147">A good screenplay is set up from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7148">Act I is a unit of action in which the major elements of the story need to be carefully integrated and established; the incidents and events in this unit of action must lead directly to the Plot Point at the end of Act I, which is the true beginning of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7149">If the script is not set up correctly, there is a certain tendency to keep adding characters and events to the story line to make it move faster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7150">I recently read a script where there were fifteen characters introduced within the first ten pages of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7151">I didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7152">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7153"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7154">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7155"> the story was about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7156">The story seemed to skate on the surface of the action without penetrating its layers of texture and depth, making it seem trite, contrived, and predictable.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7157">Why does this happen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7158">As I’ve learned through my travels and teaching, it seems many writers approach their screenplays without doing enough preparation; they’re so anxious to begin writing the script that they don’t take the time to explore and develop the relationships between the actions and characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7159">So they begin from the smallest kernel of information and then feel their way through Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7160">They seem to spend most of their time trying to figure out what their story is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7161">really</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7162"> about and what happens next, so they throw down as many story points as they can in the first act, hoping the story will manifest itself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7163">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7164">The seeds may be planted, but they are not cultivated, watered, or nourished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7165">The writer tells his or her story in the first ten pages, then is lost and doesn’t know what to do next.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7166">Preparation and research are essential to the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7167">It is the responsibility of the screenwriter to know and clearly define who the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7168">main character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7169"> is, what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7170">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7171"> is (what the story is about), and what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7172">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7173"> is (the circumstances surrounding the action). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7174">If you don’t know your story well enough, if you haven’t spent enough time doing the required research, then you run the risk of inserting incidents and events into the story line just to try to make it work, and then the narrative thread of the story usually goes awry; the stuff just isn’t working.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7175">Sometimes a problem exists because the story line is too thin, and more plot has to be found, but the solution is not creating more characters or interesting incidents to put into the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7176">Creating more events, or more obstacles to confront, is not the answer; it doesn’t do anything except expand the problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7177">The trouble is often traceable to a writer’s impulse to get the script off to a fast and provocative start. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7178">If you’ve only got ten pages to grab the attention of the reader or audience, then the tendency is to lump all of the characters, their obstacles, and their relationships with other characters into this ten-page unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7179">It’s too much, too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7180">More is not necessarily better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7181">If you take great screenplays like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7182">The Shawshank Redemption, Lord of the Rings, Seabiscuit, American Beauty, Y Tu Mamá También, Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7183">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7184">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7185">, all the major ingredients of the story line are set up and either in place or referred to within the first ten-page unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7186">The dramatic elements are simple and direct. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7187">That’s why the context of Act I is the Set-Up.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7196">Many screenwriters might approach a story like this from the perspective of dialogue; they might begin with Andy entering the prison, and then have him, during his relationship with Red, tell his story in bits and pieces. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7197">As Red informs us in voice-over, Andy doesn’t seem to belong in the prison population; when he walks “he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or worry.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7198">During their first few scenes together, Andy could explain to Red the circumstances surrounding the murder of his wife. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7199">In terms of setting up the story, this approach might work, but the tendency might be to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7200">explain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7201"> rather than </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7202">reveal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7203">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7217">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7218"> is an excellent example of classic screenwriting that sets up character and story from page one, word one, both through action and dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7219">The script could easily have started with Lovell and his crews being informed their mission was being pushed up, and if it had been written that way, most of the expository information would have to have been established within the first ten-page unit of the dramatic action.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7225">How did Emma Thompson handle this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7226">In voice-over we hear about the family, see the father on his deathbed, and learn that the family fortune is to be automatically inherited by the son. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7227">And he promises his dying father that he will take care of his three sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7228">But after the funeral, we see that the son’s wife has other plans for her husband’s inheritance.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7229">That’s a lot of information to present in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7230">But it’s been set up in both narration and pictures, so we see that the father’s widow and his three daughters are literally without a roof over their heads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7231">The rest of Act I deals with how the family is going to cope with this situation, and we see them play it out in scene after scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7232">The girls have to be married, of course, for in those days women needed husbands to take care of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7233">When a possible match between Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Edward (Hugh Grant) doesn’t happen, the girls give up the house to their brother and move to the country. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7234">Plot Point I.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7338">Is the card system the only way to construct your story?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7339">No. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7340">There are several ways to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7341">Some writers simply list a series of scenes on the computer, numbering them (1) Bill at the office; (2) Bill with John at bar; (3) Bill sees Jane; (4) Bill leaves for party; (5) Bill meets Jane; (6) Bill and Jane like each other, decide to leave together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7342">As mentioned earlier on, I don’t recommend this method, because you have less freedom to arrange and rearrange scenes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7343">Another way is to write a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7344">treatment</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7345">—a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7346">narrative synopsis</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7347"> of what happens in your story, incorporating a little dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7348">A treatment can be anywhere from four to twenty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7349">An </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7350">outline</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7351"> is also used, especially in television, where you tell your story in scenes in a detailed narrative plot progression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7352">Dialogue is an essential part of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7353">outline</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7354">, which can be anywhere from twenty-eight to sixty pages in length, depending on the show you’re writing for, be it a sitcom, an hour episodic series, or a Movie of the Week (a form that has been temporarily shelved, at least at this writing). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7355">That may change in the normal cycle of things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7356">Outlines, or treatments, should not be longer than thirty pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7357">Do you know why?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7361">You know your story from start to finish. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7362">It should move smoothly from beginning to end, with story progressions clearly in mind so all you have to do is look at the cards, close your eyes, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7363">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7364"> the story unfolding.</span></p>

<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7381">Several years ago, I was conducting one of my seven-week screenwriting workshops, and one of the participants was a prominent television news reporter for the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7382">NBC Evening News</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7383">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7384">A graduate of NYU, he had an advanced journalism degree from Stanford and had worked his way up the corporate ladder to become skilled and proficient in his chosen career. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7385">He had come to me, he said, because he wanted to turn his journalism skills into a screenwriting career. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7386">He had many stories, he went on, several of which had already made it onto the national news scene, and he was confident his scripts would be successful and profitable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7387">It seemed like he had it all figured out: He would write the screenplay, use his contacts in the industry to get the script to the “right people” (whoever </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7388">they</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7389"> were), sell it for a lot of money, and…well, I guess we all know the rest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7390">The Hollywood dream.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7391">Everybody wants to be a screenwriter.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7392">During the first few weeks it became very clear to me that he was extremely talented, that he worked hard, and that he was disciplined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7393">And yes, he had a good idea that would make a good screenplay if executed properly.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7394">And there’s the rub: “executed properly.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7395">He wanted to write a screenplay, but he wanted to write it on his terms; he wanted to do it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7396">his</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7397"> way, not the way it’s done professionally in the industry today.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7398">Because he was a professional newsperson, he was determined to write in the form he knew best and was most comfortable with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7399">He wanted to write it in “news format,” which meant the scene descriptions and commentary would be on the left-hand margin of the page and the visual description and cues on the right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7400">He placed his dialogue on the left-hand margin, the way playwrights do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7401">Obviously, that’s not proper screenplay form; it may be right in the news media, but it’s not in the film industry.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7402">When he turned in his first pages, I knew he had a major problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7403">He wasn’t capturing the dimension, either visually or emotionally, on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7404">The format got in the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7405">I suggested he should go back to the beginning and put his story in proper screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7406">He declined, saying it would get in the way of his telling the story the way he wanted to tell it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7407">I didn’t say anything, figuring he would learn the lesson for himself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7408">So, he kept writing in news form, and I kept telling him he was going to have a problem translating what he had written into proper screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7409">I could tell he didn’t believe me; there would be no difficulty, he said adamantly, in transferring his pages into the proper screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7410">I looked at him, he looked at me, and in that instant I knew his dream was going to collide with the realities of Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7411">So, as an exercise, after he had completed the first act, I asked him to transfer what he had written into proper screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7412">He had to do it sometime, I told him, so he might as well do it now.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7413">I didn’t hear from him for several days, and then I got a call telling me he’d gotten a new assignment that would take him out of town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7414">During our conversation, I asked how he was doing and if he was having any problems, trying to encourage and support him in any way I could. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7415">He paused, hesitated, stumbled around, and I knew he had perceived the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7416">Screenplays have a specific form, and if you ignore that form, thinking that at some point down the line you’re going to change it into the correct form, it’s not going to serve you or the story, and especially not the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7417">After all, screenplay form is screenplay form, just like rocks are hard and water’s wet.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7418">I didn’t hear from him during the next week, but at the following class session, he showed me his pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7419">I could see he had some doubts and reservations in letting me read the pages, and after I had looked them over, I could see why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7420">There was no narrative line of action; it was episodic, and his visuals were somewhat dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7421">It didn’t work at all, and he knew it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7422">He knew what he wanted to write, he just didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7423">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7424"> to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7425">It was a washout. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7426">Screenplay form had gotten in the way of his ability to tell his story the way he wanted to tell it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7427">That was it for him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7428">He never came back, and to this day I don’t know if he ever completed that screenplay or not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7429">So, what’s the moral of the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7430">If you want to do it, do it right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7431">He wanted to write a screenplay, but refused to learn the proper form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7432">Screenplay form is unique and precise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7433">It’s so simple it’s difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7434">Why?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7435">Look at some of the common assumptions that are so prevalent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7436">The first and most common is that when you’re writing a screenplay, it is the writer’s responsibility (read: “your” responsibility) to write in the camera instructions so the director and others can see how it should be filmed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7437">Wrong.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7438">The writer’s job is to write the screenplay and keep the reader turning pages, not to determine how a scene or sequence </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7439">should</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7440"> be filmed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7441">You don’t have to tell the director and cinematographer and film editor how to do their jobs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7442">Your job is to write the screenplay, to give them enough visual information so they can bring those words on the page into life, in full “sound and fury,” revealing strong visual and dramatic action, with clarity, insight, and emotion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7443">Don’t give the reader an excuse not to read your screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7444">That’s what the screenplay form is all about—what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7445">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7446"> a professional screenplay, and what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7447">isn’t</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7448">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7449">As a reader, I’m always looking for an excuse not to read a script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7450">So when I find a screenplay with improper form, I make a determination: An aspiring writer, a novice, wrote this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7451">The first lesson is simple: You can’t sell a script in Hollywood without the help of readers; don’t give them a reason not to take you seriously.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7452">Everybody, it seems, has his/her own conception about what is, and what is not, screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7453">Some people say if you’re writing a screenplay you’re “obligated” to write in camera angles; and if you ask them why, they’ll mumble something about “so the director knows what to film!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7454">They’ll create an elaborate and meaningless exercise called “writing in camera angles.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7455">And soon, an abundance of camera angles—like long shots, close shots, various instructions about zooms, pans, and dollies—pepper the pages, revealing a novice screenwriter who doesn’t know what he or she is doing.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7670">For most aspiring screenwriters, it’s a new form, so give yourself time to learn how to write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7671">Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7672">It takes a while to get used to it, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7673">Often I have students simply copy ten pages of a screenplay just to get the feel of the form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7674">It doesn’t matter what screenplay it is; choose ten pages at random and just copy it on the computer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7675">If you want, get screenwriting software to help remove the doubt and confusion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7676">Final Draft is the best screenwriting software around and is used by professionals like Tom Hanks, Alan Ball, Steven Bochco, Julie Taymor, James L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7677">Brooks, Anthony Minghella, and others.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8130">We’ve completed a form of preparation applicable to all writing in general, and the screenplay in particular; it is form, structure, and character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8131">You are now able to select the elements of your story that fall inside the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8132">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8133"> of screenplay form and begin the journey of writing it from beginning to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8134">In other words, you know what to write; now all you’ve got to do is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8135">write it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8136">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8137">Whatever has been said or written about the experience of writing, or the creative process, it still boils down to one thing—writing is your own, personal experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8138">Nobody else’s.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8139">There are a lot of people who contribute to the making of a movie, but the writer is the only person who sits down and faces the blank sheet of paper.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8140">Writing is hard work, a day-by-day job, sitting in front of your computer or notepad day in, day out, getting the words down on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8141">You’ve got to put in the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8142">And some days are better than others.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8143">Before you begin writing, you’ve got to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8144">find the time</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8145"> to write.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8146">How many hours a day do you need to spend writing?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8147">That depends on you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8148">I work about four hours a day, six days a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8149">Stuart Beattie writes eight hours a day, from 9 </span><span class="smallcaps"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8150">A.M.</span></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8151"> to 6 </span><span class="smallcaps"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8152">P.M.</span></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8153"> with a one-hour break. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8154">Robert Towne writes four to five hours a day, six days a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8155">Some screenwriters work only one hour a day; some write in the early morning, some in the late afternoon, some at night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8156">Some writers write twelve hours a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8157">Other writers work on a story in their head for months, telling it over and over again to people until they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8158">know</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8159"> it completely; then they “jump in” and write it in about two weeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8160">After that, they’ll spend weeks polishing and fixing it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8161">Most people need about two to three hours a day to write a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8162">That’s ideal, but sometimes not very practical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8163">In many of my screenwriting classes, I tell my students that if they’re working full-time and cannot spend an hour or two a day writing before they go to work, or when they get home, they need to keep the idea current in their minds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8164">They constantly need to think about the story line, the characters, and “what happens next.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8165">Sometimes I tell them to carry the cards with them, so they can go over the material when they’re standing in line or riding on the subway, bus, or train. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8166">Keeping a tape recorder with you when you’re driving to work, on lunch or coffee break, or on your way home, helps you to focus on your thoughts and ideas so you can remember them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8167">Then, before you fall asleep at night, listen to your ideas or lines of dialogue and you’ll be able to keep the material fresh in your memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8168">When the weekend rolls around, you can spend around two or three quality hours on Saturday and/or Sunday working on the script.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8169">What’s the best time for you to write? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8170">Look at your daily schedule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8171">Examine your time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8172">If you’re working full-time, or caring for home and family, your time is limited. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8173">You’re going to have to find the best time for you to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8174">Are you the kind of person who works best in the morning? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8175">Or does it take you until early afternoon to be wide awake and alert? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8176">Late at night may be a good time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8177">You’re going to have to experiment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8178">Find out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8179">You may get up and write a few hours before you go to work; or you might come home from work, unwind, and then write a few hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8180">You may want to work at night, say about 10 or 11 </span><span class="smallcaps"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8181">P.M.</span></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8182">, or you may go to bed early and wake up about 4 or 5 </span><span class="smallcaps"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8183">A.M.</span></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8184"> to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8185">One of my students, a major studio executive, gets up at 5 each morning, works for an hour or two, has breakfast with his family, and leaves for work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8186">It’s hard, but you can do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8187">If you’re a housewife and have a family, you may want to write when everyone’s gone for the day, either midmorning or midafternoon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8188">You be the judge of what time, day or night, you can get two to three hours alone.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8189">And a few hours alone means a few hours alone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8190">No telephone, no friends for coffee, no idle chatter, no chores, no demands made on you by husbands, wives, lovers, or children. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8191">You need two to three hours alone, without interruption.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8192">Writing is a day-by-day job—shot by shot, scene by scene, page by page, day by day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8193">Set goals for yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8194">Three pages a day is reasonable and realistic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8195">If a screenplay is approximately 120 pages long, and you write three pages a day, five days a week, how long will it take you to write a first draft?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8196">About forty working days. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8197">If you work five days a week, that means you can get a first draft done in about six weeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8198">Once you start the writing process, you’ll have days when you write ten pages, days when you do three, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8199">Just make sure you try for three pages a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8200">Or more.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8201">If you’re married, or in a relationship, it’s going to be difficult—you need some space and private time, as well as support and encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8202">Women with families can have a more difficult time than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8203">Husbands and children are not always very understanding or supportive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8204">No matter how many times you explain that you’re “going to be writing,” it doesn’t help. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8205">Demands are made that are difficult to ignore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8206">I’ve had married women tell me their husbands threaten to leave them unless they stop writing, and their children turn into monsters; the domestic routine is being interfered with, and none of them like it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8207">It’s tough to handle; emotions of guilt, anger, or frustration get in the way of your need for the time, space, and freedom to write, and if you don’t watch out you can easily become a victim of your emotions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8208">When you’re in the writing experience, you’re near your loved ones in body, but your mind and concentration are a thousand miles away. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8209">Your family</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8210"> doesn’t care or understand that your characters are in a highly charged situation; </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8211">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8212"> can’t break your concentration to deal with the snacks, meals, medication, doctors’ appointments, laundry, and shopping that you normally do.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8257">Writing is an experiential process, a learning process involving the acquisition of skill and coordination, like riding a bicycle, swimming, dancing, or playing tennis.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8258">Nobody learns to swim by being thrown into the water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8259">You learn to swim by perfecting your form, and you can only do that by actually swimming; the more you do, the better you get.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8260">It’s the same with writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8261">You’re going to experience some form of resistance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8262">It shows itself in many ways, and most of the time we aren’t even aware it’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8263">For example: When you first sit down to start writing, you may suddenly get the urge to clean the refrigerator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8264">Or to wash the kitchen floor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8265">You may want to go to the gym, change the sheets, take a drive, eat, watch television, take a yoga class, or have sex. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8266">Some people go out and buy a thousand dollars’ worth of clothes they don’t need or want! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8267">You may get angry, impatient, and yell at everybody and anybody for nothing in particular.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8268">They’re all forms of resistance.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8269">One of my favorite forms of resistance is sitting down to write and suddenly getting an idea for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8270">another</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8271"> screenplay—a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8272">much better</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8273"> idea, an idea so unique, so original, so exciting, you wonder what you’re doing writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8274">this</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8275"> screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8276">You really think about it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8277">You may even get two or three “better” ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8278">It happens quite often; it may be a great idea, but it’s still a form of resistance! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8279">If it’s really a good idea, it will keep. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8280">Simply write it up in a page or two, put it in a file marked “New Projects,” and file it away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8281">If you decide to pursue this new idea and abandon the original project, you’ll discover the same thing happening; When you sit down to write, you’ll get </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8282">another new idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8283">, and so on and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8284">It’s a form of resistance; a mind trip, a way of avoiding writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8285">We all do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8286">We’re masters at creating reasons and excuses not to write; it’s simply a barrier to the creative process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8287">So, how do you deal with it?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8288">Simple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8289">If you know it’s going to happen, simply acknowledge it when it does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8290">When you’re cleaning the refrigerator, sharpening pencils, or eating, just know that’s what you’re doing: experiencing resistance! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8291">It’s no big thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8292">Don’t put yourself down, feel guilty, feel worthless, or punish yourself in any way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8293">Just acknowledge the resistance—then move right through to the other side. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8294">Just don’t </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8295">pretend it’s not happening</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8296">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8297">It is! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8298">Once you deal with your resistance, you’re ready to start writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8299">The first ten pages are the most difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8300">Your writing is going to be awkward, stilted, and probably not very good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8301">It’s okay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8302">Some people won’t be able to deal with that; they’ll make a decision that what they’re writing is no good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8303">They’ll stop, righteous and justified because they “knew they couldn’t do it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8304">“Who am I kidding?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8305">is the usual refrain.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8329">It takes anywhere from forty to fifty pages before your characters start talking to you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8330">And they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8331">do</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8332"> start talking to you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8333">Let yourself write shitty pages, with stilted, direct, dumb, and obvious dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8334">Don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8335">Just keep writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8336">Dialogue can always be cleaned up during the rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8337">“Writing is rewriting” is the ancient adage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8338">Those of you who are looking for “inspiration” to guide you won’t find it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8339">Inspiration is measured in moments, a few minutes or hours; a screenplay depends on diligence, and is measured in weeks and months. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8340">If it takes you a hundred days to write a screenplay, and you’re “on” for ten of those days, consider yourself lucky. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8341">Being “on” for a hundred days, or even twenty-five days, just doesn’t happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8342">You may hear that it does, but in truth it’s the pot at the end of the rainbow—you’re chasing a dream.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8345">Writing is a day-by-day job, two to three hours a day, five days a week, either during the day or on weekends, three or more pages a day, ten pages a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8346">Shot by shot, scene by scene, sequence by sequence, page by page, act by act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8347">And some days are better than others.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8360">I said in </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-24"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8361">Chapter 12</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8362"> that one card equals one scene, but when you’re writing the screenplay, that will be contradictory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8363">You’ll suddenly “discover” a new scene that works better or that you hadn’t thought of. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8364">Use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8365">It will lead you to veer off the path of the cards into a few new scenes or sequences that you hadn’t even considered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8366">I think that’s great. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8367">Do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8368">You’ll be able to tell within a few pages whether it’s working or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8369">Usually you’ll finish the pages, then won’t know what to do, or where to go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8370">Look at the next card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8371">You’ll find you have a perfect lead-in to the next scene on the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8372">If it doesn’t work, all you’ve lost is a couple of days, but you’ve maintained your creative energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8373">You haven’t really lost anything.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8374">It doesn’t matter if you want to drop scenes or add new ones; just do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8375">Your creative mind has assimilated the cards so you can throw out a few scenes and still be following the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8376">direction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8377"> of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8378">When you’re doing the cards, you’re doing the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8379">When you’re writing the screenplay, you’re writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8380">Forget a rigid adherence to the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8381">Let them guide you, but don’t be a slave to them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8382">If you feel a spontaneous moment that gives you a better, more fluid story, write it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8383">So, what are some qualities that make up good screenwriting? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8384">Several things, perhaps the most important of which is to understand that the foundation of all good dramatic writing is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8385">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8386">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8387">Stating it once again, all drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action; without action you have no character; without character, you have no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8388">And without story, you have no screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8389">Dramatic conflict can be either internal or external; stories like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8390">The Hours, Chinatown, The Manchurian Candidate, A Place in the Sun</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8391"> (Michael Wilson and Harry Brown), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8392">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8393">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8394">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8395"> have both internal and external conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8396">External conflict is where the conflict is outside the characters and they face physical (and of course, emotional) obstacles, such as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8397">Cold Mountain, Collateral, Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8398">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8399">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8400">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8401">Creating conflict within the story, through the characters and events, is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing, whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8402">So what is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8403">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8404">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8405">If you look up the word, you’ll see it involves “opposition”; and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character or characters be in opposition to some</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8406">one</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8407"> or some</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8408">thing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8409">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8410">Conflict can be anything: a struggle, a quarrel, a battle, or a chase scene; fear of life, or fear of failure or success; internal or external—any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8411">Conflict must be at the very hub of your story, because it is the core of strong action and strong character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8412">If you do not have enough conflict, the foundation to your writing, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in a quagmire of dull writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8413">Keep writing, day by day, page by page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8414">And during the writing process you’re going to discover things about yourself you never knew. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8415">For example, if you’re writing about something that happened to you, you may reexperience some old feelings and emotions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8416">You may get “wacky” and irritable and live each day as if you were on an emotional roller coaster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8417">Don’t worry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8418">Just keep writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8419">You’re going to move through three stages of your first-draft screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8420">The first stage is the “words on paper” stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8421">That’s when you put it all down—everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8422">During this stage, if you’re in doubt about writing a scene or not writing it, write it. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8423">If in doubt, write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8424">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8425">That’s the rule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8426">If you start censoring yourself, you might wind up with an eighty-page screenplay, and that’s too short. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8427">(Comedies, however, are usually about eighty-five to ninety pages.) You’ll have to add scenes to what is with any luck an already tight structure to fill it out and bring it to length, and that’s extremely difficult to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8428">It’s easier to cut scenes than add them to an already structured screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8429">Keep moving forward in your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8430">If you write a scene and go back to clean it up, polish it, and “make it right,” you’ll find you’ve dried up at about page 60, lost all your creative spark, and you might even shelve the project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8431">Many writers I know who’ve tried to write a draft this way have failed to complete it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8432">Any major changes you need to make, do in the second draft.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8433">There will be moments when you don’t know how to begin a scene, or what to do next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8434">You know what happens on the cards, but not how to get into it visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8435">If this happens, break down the action of your scene into a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8436">What’s the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8437">Where does your character come from? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8438">What is his/her purpose in the scene?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8439">Ask yourself “What happens next?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8440">and you’ll get an answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8441">It’s usually the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8442">first</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8443"> thought skittering across the back of your mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8444">Grab it, and throw it down on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8445">It’s what I call the “creative grab,” because you’ve got to be quick enough to “catch it” and put it down.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8446">Many times you’ll try to improve that first idea to “make it better.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8447">If your first thought is to place the scene in a car driving down the highway, and you decide to make it a walk in the country or a walk on the beach, you’ll lose a certain creative energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8448">Do it too many times and your script will reflect a contrived, deliberate quality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8449">It won’t work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8450">There’s only one rule that governs your writing—not whether it’s “good” or “bad,” but does it work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8451">Does your scene or sequence work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8452">If it does, keep it in, no matter what anybody says.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8453">If it works, use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8454">If it doesn’t, don’t.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8470">Writing is the ability to ask yourself questions and get the answers.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8471">Sometimes you’ll get into a scene and not know where you’re going, or what you’re looking for to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8472">You know the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8473">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8474">, not the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8475">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8476">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8477">So you’ll write the same scene five different times, from five different points of view, and out of all these attempts you may find one line that gives you the key to what you’re looking for.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8478">You’ll rewrite the scene using that one line as your anchor thought and eventually be able to create something dynamic and spontaneous. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8479">You just have to find your way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8480">And trust yourself.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8488">This is the most mechanical and uninspiring stage of writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8489">You’ll take what is perhaps a 180- to 200-page draft of your script and reduce it to 130 or 140 pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8490">You’ll cut out some scenes, add new ones, rewrite others, make any changes you need to, to get it into a workable form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8491">It might take you about three weeks to do this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8492">When you’ve finished, you’re ready to approach the third stage of your first-draft script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8493">This is where you see what you’ve got, where the story really gets written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8494">You’ll polish it, accent it, hone and rewrite it, trim it to length, and make it all come to life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8495">You’re out of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8496">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8497"> now, so you can see what you’ve got to do to make it better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8498">In this stage you may rewrite a scene as many as ten times before you get it right.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8499">There will always be one or two scenes that don’t work the way you want them to, no matter how many times you rewrite them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8500">You know these scenes don’t work, but the reader will never know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8501">He/she reads for story and execution, not content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8502">It usually takes me about an hour to read a script, seeing it in my head rather than reading it for prose style or content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8503">Don’t worry about the few scenes you know don’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8504">Let them be.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8529">There may be times during the screenwriting process when you experience a sinking sensation in the pit of your stomach, when suddenly there is a cloud of negativity and confusion sprinkled on the waters of your creativity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8530">And it seems to come out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8531">Most writers, including myself, try to ignore the feeling, to push it away, hide it under the carpet; yet the more we try to dispel it, to pretend it’s not there, to hover behind a false bravado, the more we realize we’re stuck, lost somewhere within a maze of our own creation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8532">That’s when we hit “the wall.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8533">Almost all writers, at some time or other, experience this wall, or block, and try to force their way through it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8534">Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8535">Most of the time it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8536">And no matter where you are in the screenwriting process, the first “words on paper” draft or the rewrite, it doesn’t take much to be overwhelmed by the writing process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8537">We handle this kind of problem in many different ways, of course, like suddenly finding more “important” things to do, like cleaning the kitchen, going to the market, washing the dishes, or going to the movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8538">Whatever.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8539">After all, some parts of the story are more difficult than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8540">And some scenes need more work than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8541">After a few days of struggling with these particular pages, struggling with some of these thoughts and feelings, you may notice doubts about your abilities as a writer beginning to surface. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8542">You may find yourself thinking too much, asking yourself questions like: What am I going to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8543">How am I going to get back on track? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8544">You’ll question yourself, your talent, your ability to get the job done.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8545">Then one morning you’ll wake up and suddenly recognize that a heavy haze of uncertainty is hanging around your neck, and the feeling that’s been tugging at you for the last few days finally erupts like a volcano and you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8546">know</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8547"> you really don’t know what you are doing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8548">You finally admit that you don’t know how to help yourself or where to go or what to do; the only thing that makes any sense at all is surrendering to the state you are in—dazed, lost, and confused.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8549">Welcome to the world of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8550">If you are writing a story and do not know what emotional forces are working on your character, it is very easy to “run up against the wall” and keep “going around in circles,” ultimately falling into that well known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8551">writer’s block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8552">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8553">Here’s the way it usually works: You’re totally immersed in the day-to-day process of screenwriting, but there may be one scene or sequence that does not work as well as it should, and you might begin to wonder why it’s not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8554">Still, it’s just a random thought and you probably don’t pay much attention to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8555">But you might become aware of a subtle shift occurring within yourself, maybe some doubts about why this scene or sequence is failing to come together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8556">Then you might find that you’re talking to yourself, having a little conversation about “the Problem.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8557">The first thing that usually happens is you start questioning yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8558">“If I weren’t so stupid, I could do this,” you might think, and the more you wrestle with the problem, the more your image as a screenwriter begins to erode, and then you start making disparaging comments about yourself and your ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8559">That’s when you begin sliding into “the pit,” and soon the entire litany of negative judgments descends upon you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8560">“I knew I should have stayed away from this subject,” you might think, or “I’m no good at writing.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8561">Soon you’ll begin to expand and enlarge on your insecurities, thinking, “I don’t know whether I should be writing this script,” or “Maybe I just don’t have the talent to do this,” or “Maybe I should just find a partner and write it with someone else.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8562">It goes on and on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8563">But underneath all these thoughts, comments, or judgments you’re making is the common thread that somehow it’s all “your fault.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8564">If you could do it, you would, and if you can’t, it’s because you don’t have the talent or ability to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8565">In short, we turn it inside and blame ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8566">No wonder it’s called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8567">writer’s block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8568">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8569">If you’re in this dilemma, and this veil of doubt and negativity is smothering your creative voice, then it’s time to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8570">give the critic a voice</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8571">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8572">That means giving that judgmental, critical, and negative voice that’s roaming around inside your head the opportunity to speak his or her mind.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8573">Remember that this is one of those common problems that strike fear in the hearts of screenwriters everywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8574">I recall a screenwriting student coming into class one night with a strange and somewhat tortured look on her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8575">When I asked her what was wrong, her eyes welled up with tears and she became very serious, and said, “I don’t know where I’m going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8576">I’m totally lost, I’m confused, and my pages stink. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8577">All that’s happening is talk, talk, talk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8578">I keep going around in circles, and I don’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8579">I’m so upset I could cry.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8580">It’s a universal problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8581">How you get out of it varies from person to person, script to script, but the first thing to do is to admit </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8582">you have a problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8583"> and that it’s not going to go away until you deal with it, confront it head-on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8584">That’s just one of the truths of life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8585">In my student’s case she was so close to the material she couldn’t see it anymore, so the first thing I wanted her to do was just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8586">When you reach this kind of crisis point, you’re so overwhelmed and frustrated that you have to regroup. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8587">Just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8588">Put down your pen and paper, shut off your computer or tape recorder, however you’re working, and spend some time contemplating your story: What is the story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8589">What is the dramatic need of your main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8590">How are you going to resolve the story line? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8591">The answers to these questions are the key to getting back on track.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8592">First, go to your screenplay pages and take out a separate piece of paper and label it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8593">The Critic’s Page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8594">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8595">As you start writing the script, every time you become aware of a negative comment, thought, or judgment, just write it down on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8596">The Critic’s Page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8597">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8598">Number the comments, label them, just as if you were keeping a journal or making a shopping list. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8599">You might become aware of such comments as “These pages are terrible,” or “I don’t really know what I’m doing,” or “This isn’t working,” or “Maybe somebody else should finish it for me”; maybe “These characters all sound the same” and it’s apparent that “I’ve lost my vision,” and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8600">Whatever your thoughts and comments are about your pages, just write them down on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8601">The Critic’s Page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8602">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8610">At this point, stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8611">The next day, take the critic’s pages, put them in order, and read them: all your negative comments for day one, day two, day three. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8612">As you think about these comments, mull them over in your mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8613">As you look these pages over, you’ll discover something very interesting: The critic </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8614">always says the same thing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8615">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8616">It doesn’t matter what kind of scene it is, or who the characters are, or what you write; whether it’s the pages from day one, two, or three, whether it’s a dialogue scene or an action scene, the critic always says the same thing—uses the same words, the same phrases, the same expressions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8617">It’s all the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8618">Your pages are no good; they stink. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8619">No matter </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8620">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8621"> you write, this is what your critic is telling you: The pages are no good; you should be doing something else.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8622">That’s the nature of the mind: to judge, to criticize, to evaluate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8623">The mind can be either our best friend or our worst enemy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8624">It’s so easy to get plugged into our judgments and evaluations of what’s right or wrong, good or bad.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8625">Now, it could be that what the critic says is accurate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8626">Maybe the pages </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8627">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8628"> terrible, the characters </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8629">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8630"> thin and one-dimensional, and you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8631">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8632"> going around in circles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8633">So what? </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8634">Confusion is the first step toward clarity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8635">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8636">What you try that doesn’t work will always show you what does work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8637">As you struggle through your problem area, just get something down on paper; just write lousy pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8638">You’ll always be able to go back and make them better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8639">That’s the process all writers go through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8640">So what if you’ve “hit a wall” and are going around in circles, dazed, lost, and confused.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8641">Give the critic a voice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8642">If you don’t give the critic a voice, it’ll turn inside and begin to fester, getting worse and worse until it bursts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8643">It’s easy to let yourself become your own victim.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8649">Writer’s block is a powerful enemy and can hammer you into submission; the mere thought of writing will turn you off, and because you’re not writing you’ll feel guilty, so whenever you sit down to write you’ll suddenly feel this blanket of heaviness settle over your head, causing you to lose all objectivity and fall into despair.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8650">Writer’s block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8651">It happens all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8652">To everybody.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8653">The difference is how you deal with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8654">How you see it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8655">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8656">There are two different ways to look at this “problem.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8657">One is to see your dilemma as a real problem, a real block, something to “overcome” or “break through,” a physical and emotional obstacle that is locking you into a creative straitjacket.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8658">That’s one way of looking at it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8659">But there’s another way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8660">And that is to see the ordeal as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8661">part of the writer’s experience</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8662">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8663">After all, it’s universal, everybody goes through it; it’s nothing new or unusual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8664">If you recognize and acknowledge that, you’ve reached a creative crossroads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8665">The realization becomes a creative guide to another level of your screenwriting craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8666">If you can look at it as an opportunity, you will find a way to strengthen and broaden your ability to create characters and story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8667">You’ll see that maybe you need to go deeper into your story and strive for another level of richness, full of texture and dimension.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8668">“A man’s reach should exceed his grasp,” the poet Robert Browning wrote.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8669">If you understand that being challenged by writer’s block, being dazed, lost, and confused, is only a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8670">symptom</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8671">, this “problem” becomes an opportunity to test yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8672">And isn’t that what life is all about—putting yourself on the line in a situation where you test yourself to rise to another level? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8673">It’s simply an evolutionary step along the path of the screenwriting process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8674">If you accept this point of view, it means you’re going to have to dig deeper into your material; you’re going to have to stop writing, go back into your character’s life and action, and define and clarify different elements of your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8675">You’re going to have to go back and do new character biographies; to define or redefine the characters and their relationships to each other, which are, after all, the hub of your story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8676">If you’re working on a particular scene, for example, you may need to rewrite it, or change the points of view of your characters; you may need to change locations, or create new actions, episodes, or events for your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8677">Sometimes you may have to restructure the action in a particular scene or sequence by restructuring the entire act!</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8678">Keep writing, day by day, page by page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8679">The more you do the easier it gets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8680">When you’re almost finished, perhaps ten or fifteen pages from the end, you might find you’re “holding on.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8681">You might spend four days writing one scene or one page, and you’ll feel tired and listless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8682">It’s a natural phenomenon; you simply don’t want to finish it, to complete it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8683">Let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8684">Just be aware that you’re holding on, then let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8685">One day you’ll write “Fade Out,” or “The End”—and you’ll be done. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8686">It</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8687"> will be done.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8695">And when you’ve completed the draft, it’s a time of celebration and relief. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8696">When it’s over, you’re going to experience all kinds of emotional reactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8697">First, there’s satisfaction and relief. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8698">A few days later, you’ll be down, depressed, and won’t know what to do with your time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8699">You may sleep a lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8700">You’ve got no energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8701">This is what I call the “postpartum blues” period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8702">It’s like giving birth to a baby: You’ve been working on something for a substantial period of time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8703">It’s been a part of you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8704">It’s gotten you up in the morning and kept you awake at night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8705">Now it’s over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8706">It’s natural to be down and depressed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8707">The end of one thing is always the beginning of something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8708">Endings and beginnings, right?</span></p>

</div>
<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8719">The story of Seabiscuit is a unique and inspirational one, not only for what the horse accomplished but for the way in which he accomplished it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8720">During the second half of the 1930s, Seabiscuit became a cultural icon throughout the length and breath of the land. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8721">He was universally praised, his exploits and appeal so legendary that the very name “Seabiscuit” seemed to transcend the sport itself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8722">But this was more than just a story of a physically and spiritually broken horse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8723">With his extraordinary rise to fame, he became a symbol of hope; here was a story of three men and a horse striving for some kind of belief and faith to hold on to in the midst of the Great Depression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8724">Seabiscuit became the object of the nation’s faith, someone to root for, something we could believe in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8725">As a horse, he was not much to look at—he was small and had short legs—but he was blessed with an indomitable will that remained intact even after he spent two entire seasons floundering in the lowest ranks of horse racing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8726">That all changed when the horse came under the forcefully gentle and patient leadership of Tom Smith, a man who personified the freedom of the frontier and preferred the company of horses to that of men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8727">Red Pollard, Seabiscuit’s jockey, had been abandoned by his parents as a boy, and for years was a failing jockey who barely survived. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8728">Charles Howard was a self-made millionaire who lost the only thing he really loved and lived for, his young son.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8729">Taken together, these three men and a horse were emotionally shattered in their search for unity and wholeness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8730">When they joined together, they fulfilled a need in one another: Charles Howard became the father figure, Tom Smith the teacher, Red Pollard the jockey, the son, the doer; they became a team, a family, sharing their skills to forge the legend known the world over as Seabiscuit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8731">As Red says at the end of the movie: “You know, everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him, but we didn’t….He fixed us. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8732">Every one one of us. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8733">And, I guess in a way, we kind of fixed each other too.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8734">Gary Ross adapted </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8735">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8736"> from a best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand and turned it into an original screenplay based on the life and exploits of the legendary racehorse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8737">As a screenplay adapted from a book, it honored the original source material both in terms of spirit and integrity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8738">It is a moving, inspirational cinematic experience that captures the essence of the legendary horse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8739">When I first read the book I loved it—it was an exciting, informative experience—and I wondered if Gary Ross, the writer-director, would be able to take such broad, sweeping historical events and fuse them into a poignant, gripping story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8740">What makes this adapted screenplay so good? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8741">And what’s the best way to go about adapting a novel, play, magazine article, or newspaper story into a screenplay?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8742">There are many ways, of course. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8743">When you adapt a novel or any source material into a screenplay, you must consider your work an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8744">original</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8745"> screenplay </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8746">based</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8747"> on other material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8748">You can’t adapt a novel literally and have it work, as Francis Ford Coppola learned when he adapted F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8749">Scott Fitzgerald’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8750">The Great Gatsby</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8751">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8752">Coppola—the noted filmmaker of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8753">The Conversation, The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8754">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8755">Apocalypse Now</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8756">, among many other great works—is one of the most arresting and dynamic writer-directors in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8757">In adapting </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8758">The Great Gatsby</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8759"> he wrote a screenplay that is absolutely faithful to the novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8760">The result is a visually magnificent failure; dramatically, it didn’t work at all.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8761">Adaptation is both a skill and a challenge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8762">The verb </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8763">to adapt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8764"> means “to transpose from one medium to another.” </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8765">Adaptation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8766"> is defined as the ability “to make fit or suitable by changing, or adjusting”—modifying something to create a change in structure, function, and form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8767">It only </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8768">starts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8769"> with the novel, book, play, article, or song. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8770">That is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8771">source</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8772"> material, the starting point—nothing more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8773">It is a singular art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8774">Adapting an existing work, whether a novel, play, magazine article, newspaper story, or biography into a medium such as a screenplay is difficult, to say the least. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8775">Just ask Charlie Kaufman, who wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8776">Adaptation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8777">, a film that chronicles the struggle of a screenwriter trying to adapt a novel about orchids into some kind of cinematic experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8778">Not many can do adaptations well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8779">Each form is so different from any other that any adaptation has to be approached as an original screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8780">As mentioned earlier, in a novel the dramatic action of the story, the narrative line, is usually told through the eyes of the main character; the reader knows his/her thoughts, feelings, memories, hopes, and fears. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8781">There may be chapters written from other characters’ points of view, but the dramatic action usually occurs inside the main character’s head, within the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8782">mindscape</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8783"> of dramatic action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8784">The screenplay, of course, is different; it is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8785">a story told with pictures</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8786">, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8787">Film, when you get right down to it, is behavior.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8788">Words and pictures; apples and oranges.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8789">Every screenwriter approaches the craft of adaptation differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8790">Alvin Sargent, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8791">Ordinary People, Spider-Man 2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8792">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8793">Julia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8794">, among other films, reads the source material as many times as it takes to “make it his own,” until it’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8795">his</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8796"> story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8797">Then he writes individual scenes in a random fashion, lays them all together on the floor, and shapes a story line out of those individual scenes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8798">Ted Tally, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8799">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8800"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8801">The Juror</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8802">, says he “breaks down the book scene by scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8803">I try to establish the structural line of events; this event happens, then this event, then this and this happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8804">What’s important from the book is what sticks in your mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8805">So I put those scenes on cards, one by one, just getting the story down, concentrating on the main needs of the adaptation.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8806">The first thing Tally does is determine who the story is about, and anything that does not serve the main character needs to be cut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8807">When you’re adapting a book that may be 350 or more pages into a screenplay that’s only 120 pages, you have to be ruthless, yet maintain the integrity of the source material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8808">Which is what Gary Ross did in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8809">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8810">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8811">Not only did he have to capture the tone and temper of the times, but he wove action that occurred over many years into a two-hour-plus movie, yet still remained true to the source material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8812">And within the historical context of the times, he had to set up the lives of three men, as well as that of Seabiscuit, then structure their journey as they overcame obstacle after obstacle to achieve their success on both a personal and professional level.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8813">It’s a general rule that if you’re adapting a book or an article to fit the needs of a screenplay, you may have to shift, omit, or add scenes in order to follow the main story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8814">“The last thing you’re concerned with,” Tally says, “is invention for its own sake. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8815">If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8816">Meaning that if scenes work within the context of the screenplay, don’t change them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8817">If you can’t use scenes in the book, you may have to create new ones to make the film work on a visual level, not a literary one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8818">Remember that when you’re deliberately breaking a book apart in order to make it into a screenplay, you’re going to have to invent new scenes, or invent a way to meld two or three scenes from the novel into one scene in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8819">And that means you’re going to have to invent transitions to keep the action moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8820">And then you’re going to have to invent dialogue for those transitions because you’ve sacrificed so much information, the story could be confusing.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8847">This is one of the common challenges writers have when they approach an adaptation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8848">I talked with Stuart Beattie, the gifted young writer of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8849">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8850">, after he had just completed adapting a novel into a screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8851">I asked how he approached the adaptation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8852">The film, adapted from the novel </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8853">Derailed</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8854"> by James Siegel, is “a thriller novel,” he began, “about an ordinary guy who has an affair and his wife gets incredibly derailed as a result of this one moment of weakness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8855">So, there’s a morality aspect to it, very much a Hitchcockian kind of everyday man who is put into an extraordinary circumstance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8856">The character keeps trying to get out of it, but just gets deeper and deeper into the situation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8857">“When I first read the book I was literally on the edge of my seat,” he continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8858">“It was a four-hundred-page book and about three hundred pages into it I knew it would make a great film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8859">Then this incredible hundred-eighty-degree plot twist occurs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8860">You know, it’s one of those ‘don’t do’ rules of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8861">You just ‘don’t do’ things like putting in an unexpected plot twist at the end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8862">“Even though I had to get rid of the last third of the book,” he said, “the drama is in the family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8863">The girl has type one diabetes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8864">The mother and father are saving up for this new drug that’s coming out which would basically save her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8865">She has a dialysis machine every night that’s strung out in the second mortgage payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8866">They’re all in stress. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8867">Not connecting anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8868">Wrapped up in the pain of the dilemma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8869">That kind of hellhole. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8870">So it sets up the situation of him walking out of the marriage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8871">That’s basically the set-up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8872">It starts out like it’s going to be a family drama, then twists around violently at the end of the Act I, then twists around again and again.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8873">I asked how many times he read the material before he began writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8874">“Two or three times,” he told me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8875">“The first time through is the most important, because that’s the time you’re getting it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8876">I’ll write ‘good scene, good line, good moment, or something like this could be an opening scene,’ that kind of stuff, not knowing where everything’s going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8877">Then you’ve got to let it go and make the movie out of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8878">And then, a few weeks before shooting, we go back to the book and see if there’s anything that’s been dropped along the way: a line, a moment, something like that.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8879">“I don’t do a very detailed outline after I read the book two or three times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8880">I do a beat sheet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8881">Around a two- or three-page beat sheet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8882">Like, ‘the scene in the car, the scene in the elevator, the scene in the house, the scene at the doctor’s, and so on.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8883">In a screenplay, I’ll normally do a ten-page outline. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8884">And usually I try to get that down to a five-page outline. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8885">Getting it down to five pages, I’ve got Act I on page one, Act III on page five…that just works for me.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8886">When you approach a historical adaptation, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8887">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8888">, Charles Frazier’s National Book Award–winning novel about the physical and spiritual survival of two lovers at the end of the Civil War, there are other challenges. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8889">Anthony Minghella approached the adaptation with the underlying motif of a journey home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8890">It has the main characters, a dramatic and emotional journey, a dramatic purpose, a series of obstacles, a woman waiting with hope and patience, and a place that resides in Inman’s heart that represents Cold Mountain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8891">In a time when brothers were fighting brothers and lovers were torn from each other’s arms, Cold Mountain becomes a symbol of love, a spiritual place that resides within the heart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8892">It represents not only the physical journey that Inman, the Rebel soldier, endures to return home, but his spiritual journey as well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8893">Survival is uncertain, the wages of war affecting all who walk its path. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8894">The entire story is about the return from war and the effects of war’s brutality and chaos on the world away from the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8895">Minghella departed from the novel, shortening and condensing it, yet kept the obstacles of the journey intact. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8896">In the novel, Inman, after enduring test after test of valor, courage, and loyalty, returns home to Cold Mountain and finds his love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8897">And a single night becomes all the time they have together.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8898">There may be times in your adaptation that you have to add new characters, drop others, create new incidents or events, perhaps alter the entire structure of the book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8899">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8900">Julia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8901">, Alvin Sargent created an entire movie out of an episode from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8902">Pentimento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8903"> by Lillian Hellman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8904">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8905">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8906">, the entire movie was conceived from what seems to be only a few paragraphs in the novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8907">And then Anthony Minghella did some twenty-seven rewrites of the material on paper and in the editing room, shaping it into what became the final film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8908">The source material and the screenplay are usually two different narrative forms; think apples and oranges. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8909">When you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8910">adapt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8911"> a novel, play, article, or even a song into a screenplay, you are changing one form into another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8912">You are writing a screenplay </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8913">based on other material</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8914">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8915">In essence, however, you are writing an original screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8916">And you have to approach it that way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8917">This is what Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens had to deal with in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8918">Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8919">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8920">The source material for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8921">The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8922"> is Volume Two of the Trilogy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8923">Books III and IV comprise </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8924">The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8925">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8938">In approaching this book, it would not be very effective, at least dramatically, to structure the screenplay based on the progression of events as they occur in Books III and IV. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8939">You would have two different films: one about the Fellowship, the other about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8940">In film, you have to keep the story moving forward, and the best way to do that is by intercutting the events between the main characters, then weaving the narrative line of action through the story, like weaving a particular thread through the canvas of a tapestry; the story line always has to keep moving.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8941">“We had the event story, which we grappled with,” Philippa Boyens said, “and the ongoing process of whose story we were following at any one time, and the emotional through line of the story, of characters and how they were woven together and connected to the whole—all of the things that every screenwriter grapples with.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8973">Huston liked the feel of the book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8974">He thought he could capture its integrity on film, making it a hard-boiled, gritty detective story in tune with Hammett’s style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8975">Just before he left on a vacation, he gave the book to his secretary and told her to go through it, breaking down the written narrative into screenplay form, labeling each scene as either interior or exterior, and describing the basic action using dialogue from the book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8976">Then he left for Mexico.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8992">“For example, the movie ends halfway through the book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8993">We made a decision to end it there, on the Haldeman mistake, rather than show Woodward and Bernstein going on to their greater glory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8994">The audience already knew they had been proven right and gone on and gotten rich and famous and were the media darlings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8995">To try and end </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8996">All the President’s Men</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8997"> on an upbeat note would have been a mistake. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8998">So we ended it there, on the Haldeman mistake, a little more than halfway through the book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8999">The most important thing about the screenplay was setting up the structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9000">I had to make sure we found out what we wanted to find out when we wanted to find it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9001">If the audience is confused, we’ve lost them.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9081">“I knew the ‘bad guy being the hero’ could get me into some pretty dangerous territory,” he said, “both morally and ethically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9082">I thought there must be a way to deflect this image of bad guy as hero, and use what’s great about the character.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9083">The dramatic need of the Terminator is to terminate, to kill anybody or anything that gets in his way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9084">Because he is a cyborg, a computer, he cannot change his nature; only a human or another robot can change the program. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9085">So to change the bad guy into a good guy requires changing the dramatic situation, the circumstances surrounding the action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9086">“The key was the kid,” Cameron explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9087">“Because it’s never really explained why John Connor has such a strong moral template. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9088">For me, John was pushed by the situation when he sees the Terminator almost shoot the guy in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9089">I think everybody invents their own moral code for themselves, and it usually happens in your teens based on what you’ve been taught, what you’ve seen in the world, what you’ve read, and your own inherent makeup.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9090">“John Connor intuitively knows what’s right but can’t articulate it,” Cameron continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9091">“John says, ‘You can’t go around killing people,’ and the Terminator says, ‘Why not?’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9092">And the kid can’t answer the question. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9093">He gets into a kind of ethical, philosophical question that could go on and on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9094">But all he says is ‘You just can’t.’</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9095">“What is it that makes us human?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9096">Cameron asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9097">“Part of what makes us human is our moral code. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9098">But what is it that distinguishes us from a hypothetical machine that looks and acts like a human being but is not?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9099">So Cameron changed the context of the sequel to make an emotional shift; he turned a killing machine into the protector of young John Connor, the future leader of the rebels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9100">Because he’s now the “protector,” he must obey the boy’s command that it’s not “right” to kill anybody. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9101">Why it’s not right is something the Terminator has to figure out on his own. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9102">Basically, the Tin Man gets a heart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9103">It works totally within the context of the sequel and is one of the things that make </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9104">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9105"> so successful.</span></p>

<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9317">Jean Renoir was a man who loved film with a fervent, almost religious passion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9318">He loved to talk about cinema, and there was no topic too large or too small for him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9319">During the year I was under his tutelage, he shared his experience of the theater, art, acting, and literature and expounded upon the world of cinema. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9320">He insisted movies had the potential to be literature, but should never be considered a true “art.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9321">When I asked what he meant by that, he replied that in his definition true “art” is the sole vision of one person, which in the scheme of the filmmaking process is not at all the case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9322">He explained that one person can’t do everything required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9323">One person can write the screenplay, direct the film, star in it, photograph it, edit it, and score it, like Charlie Chaplin did, but, Renoir stated, the filmmaker cannot act all the parts, or record all the sound, or handle all the lighting requirements along with the vast myriad of other technical details required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9324">He can shoot the film but he can’t develop it; he has to send it to a special film laboratory for that, and sometimes it doesn’t come back the way he wants it, or sees it in his artistic vision.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9325">Because of his background and tradition, Renoir felt that film, though a great art, was never really a “true” art in the sense that writing, painting, or music is a “true” art, because too many people are directly involved in its making and outcome.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9326">“Art,” Renoir stated, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9327">One person can’t do everything….True art is in the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9328">doing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9329"> of it.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9366">If we listen to the wisdom of Renoir, the only thing we can do by ourselves is write a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9367">You don’t need very much: a computer, pen and paper, or a typewriter and a certain amount of time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9368">Sometimes you may want to write alone, by yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9369">But there are other times when you wish you could join forces with someone and write a screenplay together, meaning </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9370">collaborate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9371"> with someone.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9372">It’s a choice you make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9373">It has both an upside and a downside.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9374">The upside of writing alone is obvious: There will be no one interfering with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9375">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9376"> you want to write and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9377">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9378"> you want to write it and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9379">when</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9380"> you want to write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9381">In other words, it is your vision and yours alone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9382">There’s no one else getting in the way—at least at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9383">There’s a lot to be said for that.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9384">The downside of doing it on your own is also obvious: You’re alone in a room staring at the blank page or an empty computer screen, and there are moments when you don’t know what happens next, or what you want to say or how you want to say it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9385">Sometimes, maybe a lot of the time, the dialogue sounds corny, contrived, and predictable; if it’s not happening the way you see it in your mind, the tendency is to turn your frustration, depression, and anger onto yourself and berate yourself for doing such a poor job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9386">So you think the writing sucks, that you can’t do it, that it’s just not working, that you’re not good enough, that you don’t have the talent to do it, that the story is trite and banal, and who do you think you’re kidding anyway?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9403">Sometimes a producer or production company has an idea and commissions you to develop it into a screenplay, and then you’re in collaboration with the producer and director. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9404">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9405">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9406">, for example, Lawrence Kasdan (with only one screenwriting credit at the time, a rewrite of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9407">The Empire Strikes Back</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9408">) met with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9409">Lucas wanted to use the name of his dog, Indiana Jones, for the hero (Harrison Ford). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9410">The other thing he knew was that the last scene of the movie would be set in a vast military basement warehouse filled with thousands of crates of confiscated secrets, much as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9411">Citizen Kane</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9412">’s basement was filled with huge crates of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9413">That’s all Lucas knew about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9414">Raiders</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9415"> at the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9416">Spielberg wanted to add a mystical dimension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9417">The three men spent two weeks locked in an office, and when they emerged, they had worked out a general story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9418">Then Lucas and Spielberg left to work on other projects, and Kasdan went into his office and wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9419">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9420">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9421">Writers collaborate for different reasons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9422">There are times, at least on some projects, when screenwriters think it’s easier to work with someone else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9423">Most television writers work in teams, and shows like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9424">Saturday Night Live, Desperate Housewives</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9425">, or the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9426">CSI: Miami</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9427"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9428">CSI: New York</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9429"> shows have a staff of anywhere from five to ten writers working on each episode. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9430">A comedy writer has to be both gagman and audience—a laugh is a laugh. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9431">Only the gifted few like Woody Allen or Neil Simon can sit in a room alone and know what’s funny and what isn’t.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9432">When you decide to collaborate on a screenplay with someone, it’s important to distinguish the three stages of the collaborative process: (1), establishing the ground rules of the collaboration; (2), the preparation required to write the material; and (3), the actual writing itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9433">All three stages are essential. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9434">If you decide to collaborate, you’d better go into it with your eyes open. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9435">For example, do you like your potential collaborator? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9436">You’re going to be working with that person for several hours a day for several months, so you better enjoy being with him or her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9437">Otherwise, you’re starting off with problems.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9438">Collaboration is a relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9439">It’s a fifty-fifty proposition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9440">Two or more people are joining together </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9441">to create an end product</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9442">, a screenplay or television show or whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9443">That’s the aim, goal, and purpose of your collaboration, and that’s where all your energy should be directed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9444">Collaborators tend to lose sight of that very quickly.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9445">Sometimes we get bogged down in “being right” and in the process engage in various ego struggles, so it’s best you ask yourself some questions before you begin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9446">For example, why are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9447">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9448"> collaborating? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9449">Why is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9450">your partner</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9451"> collaborating? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9452">What’s the reason you’re choosing to work with somebody else? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9453">Because it’s easier? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9454">Safer? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9455">Not as lonely? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9456">Out of insecurity?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9457">What do you think collaborating with someone looks like? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9458">That is, what kind of mental picture do you have of the collaboration? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9459">Most people have a picture of one person sitting at a desk in front of a computer or typewriter, typing like crazy, while his or her partner paces the room rapidly, snapping out words and phrases like a party planner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9460">You know, a “writing team.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9461">A talker and a typist.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9462">Is that the way you see it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9463">It may have been that way at one time, during the ’20s and ’30s when writing teams like Moss Hart and George S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9464">Kaufman were turning out plays and movies, but it’s not that way anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9465">Rather, it may be some kind of variation on what Peter Jackson did with his cowriters on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9466">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9467">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9468">Everyone works differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9469">We each have our own style, our own pace, our own likes and dislikes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9470">One of the best examples of what I think represents an ideal collaboration was the musical collaboration between Elton John and Bernie Taupin back in the ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9471">At the height of their musical fame, Bernie Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then fax them to Elton John, wherever he was around the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and finally record it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9472">But that’s the exception, not the rule.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9473">If you want to collaborate, you must be willing to find the right way to work—the right style, the right methods, the right working procedure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9474">I would suggest that you try out different things, make whatever mistakes you need to make, and just go through the collaborative process by trial and error until you find the best and easiest way for you and your partner to work together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9475">After all, “the sequences you try that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9476">don’t</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9477"> work,” as my film editor friend said, “are the ones that show you what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9478">does</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9479"> work.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9480">There are many choices in creating the ground rules of collaboration, how we go about working with each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9481">There really are no </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9482">rules</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9483"> on how to collaborate; you get to create them and make them up as you go along. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9484">Just as in a marriage, you’ve got to create it, sustain it, and then maintain it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9485">You’re dealing with someone else all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9486">Collaboration is a fifty-fifty proposition, with an equal division of labor.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9629">Then we got together and started throwing down cards for sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9630">We knew the ending, beginning, and Plot Points I and II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9631">We got together two, sometimes three times a week for a couple of weeks, and tossed out notes, bits of dialogue, ideas for certain moments and various sequences, and different ways of structuring them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9632">After we’d worked on this part, we got together with a bunch of cards and begin writing down ideas for scenes and sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9633">We just threw them down on the cards and didn’t worry about where they fit into the structure of the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9634">We spent about three to six weeks preparing the material: doing the research, fleshing out the characters, building the story line, and creating the mechanics of the collaboration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9635">It’s an interesting experience, because you’re creating another kind of relationship—magic at times, hell at others.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9636">Then, after we completed most of the preliminary work on the characters and story line, my partner, Jim, a special effects wizard, got called for a job he couldn’t refuse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9637">It was a major Hollywood special effects film, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9638">Spider-Man 2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9639">, and we both knew he would be working ten to twelve hours a day on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9640">It was great for him, but not so good for our collaboration; we knew it would leave us with little writing time for our project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9641">So we worked very hard organizing and building the story line and structuring the narrative through line so it would be tight before he started his new job.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9642">Once he felt established in his job and felt fairly secure in terms of deadlines and procedures, we checked in by phone at least once a week, and I began preparing some of the material and writing certain sequences based on the research we’d done, which I then e-mailed to him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9643">Each weekend, he would go over the material I had sent, do some editing and revisions, then send it back to me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9644">The rest of the time he spent with his family.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9645">After a few months, we finally started getting together on weekends and going over the material, figuring out how we’d write the first act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9646">I had already written the opening sequence, the inciting incident, and he wanted to write Act I; he did, and when he finished it, he e-mailed it to me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9647">I edited it and returned it to him, and he made whatever changes he wanted to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9648">In this way, we moved forward through the project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9649">It took us much longer with him working on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9650">Spider-Man 2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9651">, but we kept the story line in our consciousness so that when his job was finished, almost six months later, it took us only about three weeks to complete the first draft of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9652">From that point on, we e-mailed pages back and forth, revised, added scenes, discussed suggestions, and so on until we completed our first draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9653">All in all, it took us over a year to do this first draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9654">Then we spent another three or four months rewriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9655">That was our collaboration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9656">It worked fine once we established our work schedule and determined how we were going to work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9657">But the thing we had to keep foremost in our minds at all times was how we could best serve the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9658">We didn’t let our egos get in the way over a line or a scene.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9813">They learned a great deal from the experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9814">They learned that fighting doesn’t work in collaboration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9815">They learned to work together and communicate on a more personal and professional level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9816">They learned to criticize each other in a positive and supportive way, without fear and restraint. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9817">They learned to respect each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9818">They learned to serve the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9819">They learned that every person has a right to his or her own writing style and that you can’t change it, only support it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9820">She learned to respect the way he styles and fashions his words into polished prose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9821">He learned to admire and respect the way she worked—fast, clean, and accurate, always getting the job done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9822">They learned how to ask for help from each other, something that was difficult for both of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9823">In other words, they learned from each other, and supported each other in the same way that three men and a horse did in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9824">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9825">.</span></p>

<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9836">What do you do with your screenplay after you’ve completed it?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9837">First, you’ve got to find out whether it “works” or not; whether you should engrave it in stone or paper the walls with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9838">You need some kind of feedback to see whether it’s working and whether you wrote what you set out to write.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9839">At this moment you may not really be sure whether it works or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9840">You can’t see it; you’re too close to it, lost in the maze of subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9841">Of course, the first thing you need to do before you send it out to be read by a few close friends is to back up the screenplay, either on disk or hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9842">This may be obvious, but it bears stating the obvious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9843">Keep the backup copy someplace it will be safe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9844">If you only have the original printout version, and have not backed it up, never give that original to anyone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9845">You have to have a copy of the script always available to you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9846">I was recently retained as an expert witness in a lawsuit where the screenwriter had backed up his work only on his hard drive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9847">He thought he was covered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9848">When he began negotiations with a German production company on a coproduction deal, he printed out one copy and sent it off to Germany. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9849">After he sent the original hard copy, he wanted to install a DSL line so that he could e-mail his scripts with more speed and efficiency, so he hired the local phone company to install it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9850">But the installer told him his hard drive was too full to install the line and that he had to clean it up first. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9851">Well, you can probably guess what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9852">During the installation, the technician erased the entire hard drive and the writer had no backup, and because the German company had passed on the project, he had no hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9853">Basically, the writer had nothing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9854">He had to start over, from page one, word one, and re-create the screenplay from scratch.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9855">Sound far-fetched? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9856">Of course, but it’s the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9857">The moral of the story: Always back up your material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9858">Now you’re ready to give a copy of your script to two friends, close friends, friends you can trust, friends who will tell you the truth, friends who are not afraid to tell you: “I hate it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9859">What you’ve written is weak and unreal, the characters flat and one-dimensional, the story contrived and predictable.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9860">Friends who will not be afraid to hurt your feelings.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9861">You’ll find that most people won’t really tell you the truth about your script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9862">They’ll tell you what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9863">they think</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9864"> you want to hear: “It’s good; I liked it! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9865">I really did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9866">You’ve got some nice things in it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9867">Or “I think it’s commercial,” whatever that means! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9868">People’s intentions are good, but they don’t realize they’re hurting you more by not telling you the truth, not telling you what they really think about it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9869">Your name is going to be on the title page, so you want it to be the best script you can write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9870">If you feel a suggestion can improve your screenplay, use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9871">Any changes you make in a rewrite must be made from choice, and you have to be comfortable with those changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9872">This is your story, and you’ll know instinctively whether the changes work or not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9873">Which brings us to the subject of the rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9874">You know the adage “Writing is rewriting”; well, it’s true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9875">The draft you send out into the marketplace is really three different drafts: the first “words on paper” draft; what I call “the mechanical draft”; and the third draft, “the polish.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9876">This is the draft where most of the script gets written.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9877">After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it aside for a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9878">Then go back and reread the material from beginning to end in one sitting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9879">Be sure to lock up all pens, pencils, and paper and to keep the computer turned off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9880">You don’t want to take any notes as you read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9881">You just want to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9882">When you go through the first “words on paper” draft, you’ll find yourself on the roller coaster of emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9883">Some parts you think are terrible: The writing is poor, the story is all told in dialogue, the descriptions are too long, too thick, too cluttered, and what you’re reading feels weak, awkward, too direct, and just doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9884">Then you’ll read other pages that you think work okay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9885">The dialogue is good, the action tight, and overall it seems to work pretty well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9886">Then you’ll go back on the roller coaster again, alternating between the emotions of elation and depression.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9887">That’s good.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9888">After you’ve finished reading the script, put it away again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9889">Now write three essays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9890">The first essay, in free association, is to write what first attracted you to the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9891">Do this in two or three pages, more if you choose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9892">Was it the character, the situation, the idea, or the action line that originally attracted you to the material? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9893">Just answer this question: What really attracted you to the material? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9894">Throw down your thoughts, words, and ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9895">Don’t worry about grammar or punctuation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9896">Write in fragments if you want to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9897">When you’ve completed this first exercise, go on to the next.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9898">The second essay, also in free association, answers this question: What kind of a screenplay did you actually end up writing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9899">You may have started to write a mystery-thriller with a strong love interest and ended up writing a love story with a strong mystery-thriller aspect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9900">Many times, we’ll start out writing one kind of story only to end up writing another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9901">For example, one of my students started out to write about the relationship of a day laborer to a woman above his class, and ended up writing about the relationship between the laborer and his brother when the woman comes between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9902">We want a clean, coherent narrative through line in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9903">Write this second essay in two or three pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9904">For the third essay: You saw what originally attracted you to the screenplay, and may have veered from this slightly while writing the first “words on paper” draft, so what you started out to do may be slightly different from what you ended up doing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9905">In this third essay, you want to answer this question: What do you have to do </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9906">to change</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9907"> what you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9908">did</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9909"> write into what you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9910">wanted</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9911"> to write? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9912">In other words, intention must equal result. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9913">In my student’s case, she had to go back to the beginning and establish and strengthen the relationship between the two brothers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9914">Sometimes you’ll be happy with what you ended up with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9915">Great! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9916">Other times you’ll have to make changes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9917">When you’ve finished these three essays, think about what you have to do to strengthen and solidify your story line so your intention equals your result.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9918">Now read the first “words on paper” draft in units of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9919">Read Act I and make notes in the margins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9920">Out of twenty or so scenes, you’ll find you can keep ten of them intact. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9921">Of the remaining ten, you may have to change the focus in five or six of them by rewriting dialogue and possibly adding some action, and you may see that the remaining five scenes don’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9922">So, you’ll have to write five new scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9923">All in all, you may have to change anywhere from 65 to 80 percent of Act I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9924">Just do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9925">You’ve spent several months working on this script, so you want to do it right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9926">If you sell your material, you’re no doubt going to have to make changes anyway, either for the producer, director, or star. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9927">Changes are changes; nobody likes them, but we all do them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9928">In Hollywood, nobody tells you the truth, what they really think; they might tell you they like it, then add, “But it’s not something we want to do at the present time”; or “We have something like this in development,” or “We’ve already done this movie.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9929">That’s not going to help you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9930">You want feedback; you want someone to tell you what he or she really thinks about your script, so choose the people you give this first draft to carefully.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9931">After they’ve read it, listen to what they say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9932">Don’t defend what you’ve written; don’t </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9933">pretend</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9934"> to listen to what they say and leave feeling righteous, indignant, or hurt.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9935">See whether they’ve caught the “intention” of what you wanted to write about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9936">Listen to their observations from the point of view that they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9937">might</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9938"> be right, not that they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9939">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9940"> right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9941">They’ll have observations, criticisms, suggestions, opinions, and judgments. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9942">Are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9943"> they right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9944">Question them; press them on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9945">Do their suggestions or ideas make sense? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9946">Do they add to your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9947">Enhance it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9948">Go over the story with them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9949">Find out what they like and dislike; what works for them and what doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9950">At this point, you still can’t see your screenplay objectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9951">If you want another opinion “just in case,” be prepared to get confused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9952">If you give it to four people, for example, they’ll all disagree. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9953">One person will like the holdup of the moon rocks, another won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9954">One person will say he likes the holdup, but not the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9955">result</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9956"> of the holdup (the characters either get away or don’t); and the other one wonders why you didn’t write a love story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9957">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9958">You want the initial feedback of two people you can trust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9959">When you’ve incorporated their suggestions, then you can send it out into the market.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9960">Your script must be clean, neat, and professional-looking, meaning it’s got to be in correct industry format, with Courier 10 or 12 font. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9961">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9962">form</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9963"> of your screenplay must be correct. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9964">Here’s where a software program like Final Draft can be extremely beneficial.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9965">Many people ask if they should number their scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9966">I personally counsel them against it, but it’s only a personal preference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9967">Some people do, some people don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9968">Sometimes writers get hung up in the numbering, and that’s really not what it’s about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9969">It’s simply a matter of choice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9970">Just know that it’s not the writer’s job to number the scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9971">Final shooting scripts have numbers running down the left margin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9972">They indicate scene breakdowns compiled by the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9973">production manager</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9974">, not the writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9975">When a script is bought, and the director and cast are signed, a production manager is hired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9976">The production manager and director will go over the script, scene by scene, shot by shot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9977">Once locations are established, the production manager and his assistant will make a production board, a large foldout folio with each scene, interior or exterior, specifically notated on cardboard strips. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9978">When the production board is complete and the scenes notated and approved by the director, the production secretary types the numbers of each scene on each page for a shot-by-shot breakdown. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9979">These numbers are used to identify each shot, so when the film (maybe 300,000 to 500,000 feet of it) is processed and catalogued, every piece of film will be identified. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9980">It is not the writer’s job to number the scenes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9981">A word about the title page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9982">Many new and aspiring screenwriters feel they should include statements, registration or copyright information, various quotes, dates, or whatever on the title page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9983">They want to present “The Title,” an original screenplay for an “Epic Production of a Major Motion Picture for an All-Star Cast,” by John Doe, “Registered at the Writers Guild of America.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9984">Don’t do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9985">The title page is the title page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9986">It should be simple and direct: “The Title” should be in the middle of the page, “A Screenplay by John Doe” directly under it, and your address or phone number in the lower-right-hand corner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9987">Several times, as head of the story department, I would receive material from new writers without any information about where I could reach them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9988">Those scripts were held for two months, then dumped into the wastebasket.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9989">You don’t need to include any copyright or registration information on the title page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9990">But it is essential for you to protect your material.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10034">There have been times when a writer has submitted material to a producer or studio and it’s been rejected, and sometime later the writer has seen his/her idea in a movie and thinks the concept was ripped off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10035">Sometimes this happens, and sometimes people </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10036">think</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10037"> it happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10038">Several years ago, the world-famous humorist-journalist Art Buchwald, with Alain Bernheim, wrote a movie treatment for a film called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10039">Coming to America</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10040"> for Paramount Pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10041">A deal was negotiated and they were paid. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10042">The studio ultimately passed on the idea and Buchwald continued with his journalistic chores. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10043">Later, an Eddie Murphy movie was released by Paramount that seemed to have been taken directly from the treatment that Buchwald and Bernheim had written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10044">Buchwald filed a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures claiming the studio had taken their idea and not paid them for it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10045">The lawsuit garnered a lot of headlines, and also set a major precedent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10046">In order to prove their case, Buchwald and Bernheim had to reveal studio accounting practices, which was a monumental task, to say the least. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10047">Finally, after a long litigation, the court awarded them some $900,000 for copyright infringement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10048">They’d been able to prove “prior access,” meaning they proved they had submitted their idea to Paramount.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10049">Many times you’ll hear writers worrying about whether to submit a screenplay to a studio or production company because of fears their ideas will be stolen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10050">Well, according to copyright law, you “cannot copyright an idea, only the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10051">expression</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10052"> of the idea.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10053">An idea is three guys stealing moon rocks from Houston’s NASA facility. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10054">How</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10055"> they do it, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10056">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10057"> the characters </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10058">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10059"> who do it, is “the expression of the idea.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10060">That’s why if you write an unsolicited screenplay and want to submit it to a studio or production company, you will be asked to sign a release forgoing any right to litigate over any claims, either now or in the future, of copyright infringement.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10061">For example, many years ago a friend of mine wrote a script for a movie that was about a competitive skier on the European ski circuit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10062">She sent it to a number of production companies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10063">The companies all returned the material with a “thanks, but no thanks” letter.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10064">A couple of years later she went to see a movie about a skier on the European ski circuit, made by a company she had submitted her script to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10065">She saw a number of similarities to her screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10066">In fact, she thought it was her story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10067">So, she went to court and filed a lawsuit and ultimately was granted a settlement because she proved prior access—she had registered her script at the WGA, West, and had a copy of the rejection letter from the production company.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10068">Nobody did anything “intentional” in this situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10069">The production company had refused her idea, for whatever reason, and when later it went looking for a subject for a film, someone “had an idea” about a competitive skier.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10070">There have been other times when a movie is released, and writers who have written a work, usually an unproduced novel or screenplay, claim copyright infringement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10071">They had submitted their material to the company but it was returned, unopened and unread. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10072">They had no case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10073">They could not prove prior access, and while the ideas may have been somewhat similar, the “expressions of the idea” were not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10074">I’ve been called as an expert witness on several of these cases, and not one was legally substantiated.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10075">When you’re ready to get your material into the marketplace, you’ll need about ten copies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10076">Most story executives don’t return material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10077">If you send it to a producer or company, you’ll need to keep a record of when you sent it and to whom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10078">If you do send it to a company, someone must know the script is coming, either through e-mail or as hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10079">Otherwise, the material will be deleted, or returned unread, as no release form was signed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10080">(Sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your material simply lets the producer or story editor know you’re a novice screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10081">Don’t do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10082">The chances are it won’t be returned anyway.) So, make ten copies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10083">You’ll register one, either online or as hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10084">That leaves nine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10085">If you’re fortunate enough to get an agent to represent you, or hire an entertainment attorney, they’ll want five copies immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10086">That leaves you with four.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10087">Make sure your screenplay is bound with paper fasteners; do not submit it loose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10088">If you want, you can put a simple cover on it, a cover that bears some connection to the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10089">Do not use a fancy, embossed leatherette cover. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10090">Make sure your script is on 8 ½ × 11 paper, and not 8 ½ × 14, legal size.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10091">You’ve got one shot with your script, so make it count. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10092">One shot means this: When I was head of the story department at Cinemobile, every submission received was logged in a card file and cross-indexed by title and author. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10093">The material was read, evaluated, and written up in synopsis form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10094">It’s called “coverage.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10095">The reader’s comments were carefully registered, then filed away.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10096">If you submit your screenplay to a studio or production company, and they read and reject it, and then you decide to rewrite it and resubmit it, chances are it won’t be read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10097">The reader will pull up the original synopsis, read the coverage, and pass on the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10098">If you do make changes, change the title, or use a pseudonym. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10099">No one reads the same material twice.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10100">Do not send a synopsis of your script along with your material; it will not be read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10101">No one in Hollywood will read a treatment unless you’re an established screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10102">In Canada, Europe, South America, and perhaps the Far East, a writer can often sell his/her treatment and get money (though not much) from the government-subsidized film industry to develop the story into a screenplay—but that’s only on the international film scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10103">In Hollywood, if you send a synopsis with your material it will be to your disadvantage and like as not, immediately thrown out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10104">Usually, a screenplay has to pass the gauntlet of “The Reader.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10105">Decisions about whether or not to seriously consider a particular screenplay are usually based on this reader’s comments.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10106">So then how do you get it to people? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10107">Since most people in Hollywood don’t accept unsolicited material—that is, they don’t accept material unless it’s submitted through an authorized literary agent, an agent who has signed the Artists-Managers Agreement drawn up by the WGA—the question then becomes: Do I need an agent to sell my script, and if so, how do I get an agent?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10108">I hear that question over and over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10109">If you’re going to sell your script for a cool million or more and have Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts star in it, you’ll need a literary agent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10110">So, how do you get an agent?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10111">First, you must have a completed screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10112">An outline, or treatment, doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10113">Then you can contact the Writers Guild of America, West or East, and ask them, by e-mail, mail, or phone, to send you the list of authorized signatory agents to the Artists-Managers Agreement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10114">They’ll send you a list of agents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10115">Those agents who are willing to read unsolicited material from new writers are indicated, usually with an asterisk.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10116">List several of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10117">Contact them by mail, e-mail, or phone; ask if they would be interested in reading a screenplay by a new writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10118">Give your background; sell yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10119">Everybody is a buyer and seller in Hollywood.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10120">Most of them will say no. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10121">Try some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10122">They’ll say no, too. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10123">Try some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10124">Hollywood is a “no” town; it’s easier to say no than yes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10125">But just think what would happen if someone were to say yes to the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10126">If the film goes through the line of executives to finally be “green-lit” for production, and the film does get made, and does well at the box office, that’s a dream come true for you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10127">On the other hand, if it doesn’t do well, the person who brought in the material may be let go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10128">After all, there are millions of dollars riding on his/her decision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10129">The average life span of a film executive in Hollywood is about five years.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10130">Be that as it may, the irony is that executives are always looking for good material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10131">There is a dearth of salable material in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10132">Most of the screenplays submitted are derivative of old movies or television series or are takeoffs or satires on films that have already been made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10133">The opportunities for new screenwriters, writing fresh and original ideas, are enormous.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10134">Most of the time when you’re seeking representation, you’ll talk to the agent’s assistant or secretary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10135">Sometimes they’ll even be the ones to read your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10136">If they like it they’ll recommend it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10137">Let anyone who wants to read your script read it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10138">A good script does not go unfound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10139">As long as it’s legally protected, there’s usually not a problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10140">Even if an agent likes your screenplay, he/she may not be able to sell it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10141">But he will be able to show it around as a sample of your writing ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10142">As one agent told me, there’s nothing as hot as a script that “almost” gets sold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10143">Sometimes that will lead to a rewriting assignment, or an opportunity to pitch another one of your script ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10144">Sometimes, if a producer or story editor likes your work, you may be able to get a “development deal” from a studio or producer to write an original, or to adapt one of their ideas or books into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10145">Everybody’s looking for writers, no matter what “they” say.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10146">Give the agent three to six weeks to read your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10147">If you don’t receive a reply from him or her within that period of time, you can call.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10148">If you submit your script to a large, well-known agency, like William Morris, ICM, or CAA, the established agents will ignore it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10149">But they have readers and trainee agents there, and they all have an incentive to read it and possibly discover a marketable script.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10150">If you’re fortunate, you might even find someone who likes your work and wants to represent you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10151">Who is the best agent?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10152">The agent who likes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10153">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10154"> work and wants to represent </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10155">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10156">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10157">If you contact eight agents, you’ll be lucky to find one who likes your work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10158">You can submit your script to more than one agent at a time, but not at the same agency.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10159">A literary agent gets a 10 to 15 percent commission on whatever he or she sells. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10160">Good material does not get away from the readers in Hollywood; they can spot potential movie material within ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10161">If your script is good and worthy of production, it’s going to be found. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10162">How</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10163"> it’s found is another matter.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10164">It’s a survival process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10165">Your screenplay is entering the raging current of the Hollywood river, and like salmon swimming upstream to spawn, only a few will make it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10166">If finding an agent the “normal” way is not working for you, a good way to get your work read and possibly “discovered” is by submitting it in one of the many screenwriting contests that now exist throughout the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10167">A mention to a production company that your script has been selected as one of the finalists, or winners, in a prominent screenwriting contest like the Nichols Fellowship, Final Draft’s Big Break Contest, the Chesterfield Competition, Script-Shark’s Annual Screenwriting Competition, the Diane Thomas Award, or any of several other competitions, carries a strong appeal in the exclusive world of Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10168">Each contest receives from three to five thousand entries each year, and at present there are over a thousand of them; just go online and Google “screenwriting contests.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10169">Take a look at the Database of Screenwriting Contests and Competitions (</span><a class="calibre4" href="http://www.filmmakers.com/contests"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10170">www.filmmakers.com/​contests</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10171">) and you’ll find a list of contests and information on financial prizes, entry dates, deadlines, etc. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10172">The legitimate contests offer awards of up to $10,000 cash, as well as meetings with top agents and executives in the industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10173">I’ve been one of the judges for the Final Draft competition several times now and can tell you that the quality of the work is high. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10174">Many of the winners have gone on to find agents and have their screenplays produced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10175">That’s a good percentage of success, and a good way to break into the business.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10176">Another way to bring your script to the attention of production executives is called “online posting.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10177">For a fee you can send your script to an online literary service like ScriptShark.com, a division of Baseline StudioSystems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10178">ScriptShark is a professional script coverage and story development service specifically designed for the entertainment industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10179">It works this way: You submit your screenplay to ScriptShark and an industry reader will read and evaluate your material, then give you professional feedback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10180">If the reader likes the material, he/she will post the synopsis of the story on the service’s Web site. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10181">Most development and creative executives from major production companies check the postings daily because they’re always looking for new material; thus it’s a good way to get your material seen without going through an agent or attorney. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10182">And indeed, ScriptShark has been instrumental in helping more than one writer move forward professionally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10183">Several screenwriters have sold/optioned scripts, and ScriptShark has assisted them in setting up pitch meetings, landing writing assignments, and getting representation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10184">After you complete your screenplay, you’re entering the battlefield. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10185">Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10186">Do you know how many movies the studios and independent production companies made last year? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10187">Not that many: between four and five hundred. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10188">And while the number of studio productions today is increasing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10189">slightly</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10190">, the number of people writing screenplays is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10191">dramatically</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10192"> increasing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10193">As the number of people writing screenplays is increasing, so is the cost of making movies—it costs several thousand dollars a minute to make a major Hollywood production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10194">That’s why even a medium-budget movie in Hollywood today costs somewhere between $60 and $80 million—and the cost of prints and advertising is mind-boggling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10195">A Hollywood production has to gross at least two and a half times its negative cost to break into profit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10196">So, if a film cost $60 million to produce, it has to gross more than $150 million to just to break even. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10197">Not many films gross $150 million. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10198">And if a film doesn’t open in its first or second weekend with good numbers, it will just disappear after a few weeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10199">But with the ancillary markets, foreign markets, the DVD market, merchandising products, and TV and cable sales, at some point in the future the film might still make some kind of profit.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10200">The only thing that does not change is the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10201">You may have the greatest special effects in the world, or the most popular actors in the world, but if there is no story that engages the hearts and minds and emotions of the audience, you don’t have much of anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10202">The story is the center, the hub, the dynamic force that holds everything together. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10203">Sideways</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10204"> is a good example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10205">Adapted from a novel by Rex Pickett, written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, starring four largely unknown actors, it is an exceptional movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10206">You can make a good movie from a good script; you can make a good movie from a mediocre script; but you can’t make a good movie from a bad script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10207">And that’s where all your energies should go—into writing the best script you can.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10208">What kind of a deal can you expect to make if someone wants to buy your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10209">Prices vary, but a good rule of thumb is the Writers Guild of America minimum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10210">The minimum is broken down into two categories: a low-budget movie that costs between $1.2 and $5 million to produce, and a high-budget film that costs more than $5 million. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10211">At this writing, the WGA minimum for a low-budget, original screenplay, including a treatment, is $48,738; for a high-budget film, $91,495. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10212">These minimums will increase each time a new MBA (Minimum Basic Agreement) is negotiated.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10213">Most screenwriters don’t sell their first screenplay, but there are exceptions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10214">One of my former students at the Professional Writing Program at USC wrote her thesis script and started sending it around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10215">An agent’s assistant read it, liked it, and gave it to her boss; he read it, liked it, and sent it to a friend of his, a production executive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10216">The executive liked it, told the agent, and the agent promptly sent it out and sold it for about $600,000. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10217">Now, the writer didn’t get all this money up front. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10218">She got a few thousand dollars when she signed the agreement, and if and when the producer gets a production/distribution agreement, she’ll get a large chunk; then, on the first day of principal photography, she’ll get another chunk, and there may even be a “production bonus.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10219">An “eyeball” price for a screenplay used to be 5 percent of the budget, though that varies substantially. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10220">If you sell the script, you’ll probably receive a “percentage of the profits,” at least on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10221">You may get anywhere from 2.5 to 5 percent of the producer’s net—whatever you can get. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10222">But since hardly any films ever show a profit, at least in the accountants’ books, the chances are slim to none that you’ll ever receive any of your percentage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10223">If someone wants to buy your script, he/she will probably </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10224">option</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10225"> it for a year, with an option for a second. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10226">With an option, someone pays you for the exclusive right to get a “deal” or to raise financing for a certain period of time, usually a year or two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10227">The option price may be anything, from $1 a year to $100,000 or more—whatever you, or your attorney, can negotiate.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10228">It may take you more than a year after you receive your option money to receive the full amount for the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10229">This is the standard-type “step deal” in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10230">The numbers may vary, but the procedure will not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10231">If you do get an offer on your script, let someone represent you, either an agent or an attorney. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10232">An attorney will either charge by the hour or receive 5 percent of your earnings from the project.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10233">You can obtain an option for a book or novel just like a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10234">If you want to adapt a book or novel, you must obtain the motion picture and theatrical rights to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10235">To find out if the material is available, call the publisher of the hardbound edition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10236">Ask, either by mail, e-mail, or phone, for the subsidiary rights department. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10237">Inquire if the motion picture and theatrical rights are available. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10238">If they are, they’ll tell you or refer you to the literary agent who represents the author. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10239">Contact the agent, who will tell you whether the rights are available or not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10240">If you decide to adapt the material without obtaining the motion picture rights, you might find you’ve wasted your time, that the rights are not available and somebody else owns them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10241">If you can find out who has the rights, that person or company might be willing to read your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10242">Or might not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10243">If you want to adapt the material simply as an exercise, do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10244">Just be sure you know what you’re doing so you’re not wasting your time.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10245">It costs so much to make a movie today that everyone wants to minimize the risk; that’s why money paid to a writer is termed “front money,” or “risk money.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10246">No one likes to take a risk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10247">And the motion picture business is one of the biggest crapshoots around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10248">No one knows whether a given film is going to “go through the roof,” like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10249">Star Wars, Titanic</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10250">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10251">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10252">, and people are reluctant to put up a lot of front money for an uncertain return. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10253">Do you know anyone who spends money easily? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10254">Including yourself? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10255">Studios, production companies, and independent producers are no exception.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10256">Option money comes out of producers’ pockets and they want to minimize the risks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10257">So don’t expect a lot of money for your material the first time out: It just doesn’t work that way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10258">There are always exceptions, of course, and these are the ones you always hear about—but they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10259">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10260"> the exceptions, not the rule.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10261">When you really get down to it, you’re writing your screenplay for yourself first, for money second.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10262">Only a handful of well-known and established writers in Hollywood get enormous sums of money for their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10263">There are about 9,500 members of the Writers Guild, West, and only a few are hired to write screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10264">And less than a handful earn six figures a year. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10265">And those who do earn every penny of it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10266">Don’t set up unreal expectations for yourself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10267">Just write your screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10349">A film director can take a great script and make a great film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10350">Or he can take a great script and make a terrible film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10351">But he can’t take a terrible script and make a great film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10352">No way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10353">Some film directors know how to improve a screenplay by visually tightening the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10354">They can take a wordy dialogue scene of three to four pages and condense it into a tense and dramatic three-minute scene that “works” with five lines of dialogue, three looks, somebody taking a drink, a dog barking, and an insert of a clock on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10355">Michael Mann did this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10356">Collateral;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10357"> he sculpted the original screenplay by Stuart Beattie, visually tightening it into a tension-packed film that captures both the essence and the integrity of the script.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10358">That’s the exception, not the rule.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10359">The rule is that most directors and stars in Hollywood have little or no story sense at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10360">They’ll second-guess the writer, making changes in the story line that weaken and distort it, and eventually a lot of money is spent making a lousy film that nobody wants to see. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10361">And you’re only as good as your last film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10362">In the long run, of course, everybody loses—the studios lose money, the director adds a “flop” to his “track record,” and the writer takes the rap for writing a bad screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10363">Everybody’s a writer.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10364">Some people will complete their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10365">Others won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10366">Writing is hard work, a day-by-day job, five or six days a week, three or more hours a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10367">And some days are better than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10368">A professional writer is someone who sets out to achieve a goal and then does it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10369">Just like life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10370">Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it or you don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10371">And then there’s the old “natural law” of survival and evolution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10372">There are no “overnight success stories” in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10373">Like the saying goes, “The overnight success took fifteen years to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10374">Believe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10375">It’s true.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10376">Professional success is measured by persistence and determination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10377">The motto of the McDonald’s Corporation is summed up in its poster called “Press On”:</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10397">Commitment and sacrifice are two sides of the same coin.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10398">Wear that proudly.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10399">Talent is God’s gift. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10400">Either you have it or you don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10401">Don’t let selling or not selling your screenplay alter your internal state of mind, your feelings about yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10402">Don’t let it interfere with the experience of writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10403">In the long run, you did what you set out to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10404">You fulfilled your hopes and dreams, fulfilled your goal.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10508">That was the question my mentor Jean Renoir, the great French film director, often presented to us during the year he was Artist in Residence at the University of California, Berkeley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10509">I met him after a performance of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10510">Woyzeck</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10511">, the Georg Buchner expressionist drama, in which I was playing the lead role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10512">I was told that Renoir was going to present the world premiere of his play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10513">Carola</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10514">, and I was being asked to audition for the part.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10515">A few days later, I read for Renoir, got the third lead in the play, playing the role of Campan, the French stage manager, and so began my mentorship with a man who would ultimately shape my attitude toward movies and my life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10516">For the next year, I had a direct, close, and personal relationship with the great director. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10517">Not knowing much about film, what it was or what it could be, it was Renoir who opened up a treasure chest of knowledge and insight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10518">He shared his personal view that movies “are a new form of printing—another form of the total transformation of the world through knowledge.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10519">He would refer to Lumière, inventor of the early French motion picture camera called the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10520">Cinématographe</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10521">, as “another Gutenberg.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10522">Renoir insisted that movies had the potential to be literature, but they should never be considered art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10523">When I asked what he meant, he replied that art is the sole vision of one person, which in the scheme of the filmmaking process, is a contradiction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10524">He explained that one person can’t do everything that’s required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10525">One person can write the screenplay, direct the film, photograph it, edit it, and score it—like Charlie Chaplin did—but, Renoir continued, the filmmaker cannot act all the parts, or record all the sound, or handle all the lighting requirements amid the myriad other details that are required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10526">“Art,” he said, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10527">As young college students learning from the master, we would literally sit at his feet and ask questions, share our ideas, or discuss our opinions of life and art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10528">He would answer everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10529">Every question, even the dumbest one, was received with interest and respect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10530">When someone asked, “how can we be true to our art?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10531">he shared his personal philosophy that “art is in the doing of it.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10532">A simple answer, yet profound, relevant, and true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10533">It’s only during the process of working, he explained, whether directing a film, writing a song, writing a script, painting a picture, or whatever it may be, that one “creates art.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10534">Art, he proclaimed, is the process of actually sitting down and doing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10535">Not talking about doing it, not thinking or fantasizing about doing it, just doing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10536">Only after the work has been completed and exposed to public view will it be considered a work of “art” or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10537">If you think you’re “an artist” just waiting for that one moment of inspiration to sit down and write, you’ll be waiting forever.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10538">Over the past twenty-five years, I’ve thought about Renoir’s words as I’ve traveled the world conducting screenwriting seminars for professional and aspiring screenwriters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10539">As I look back over the footprints of my life from the time I wrote the first edition of this book, some twenty-five years ago, to now, I see that screenwriting, both as an art and a craft, has evolved into an international language of engaging visual expression.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10540">We’re currently standing on the threshold of a new frontier in film, and there are no rules as to what we can or cannot do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10541">It is a time of evolution/revolution, a time of transformation in which the theater of technology has embraced a new era of digital technology. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10542">What we see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10543"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10544">how we see it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10545"> have changed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10546">Story exposition is shown rather than told; characters are revealed through behavior, not dialogue; time present and past have merged into a compelling storytelling device. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10547">As said in Eastern philosophy, the inside and outside are one; the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are inside our head are what creates the fabric of our experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10548">Basically, you are the baker of the bread you eat.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10549">A screenplay is a special form; it is a story told in pictures, expressed in dialogue and description. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10550">The technological impact has facilitated a change in our classic traditional narrative; linear story lines like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10551">Casablanca</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10552"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10553">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10554">, expressed in long expository scenes, have become more visually stylized presentations such as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10555">Sideways, Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10556">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10557">Brokeback Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10558">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10559">Nonlinear storytelling, almost a rarity during the last few decades, has now become part of a film lexicon that seems taken for granted: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10560">The Bourne Supremacy, Memento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10561">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10562">The Constant Gardener</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10563">, are structured in bits and pieces from the shards and broken fragments of memory and have become part of the screenwriter’s language.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10564">The question Renoir posed so many years before, “</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10565">Qu’est-ce que le cinéma?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10566">” is as relevant today as when I first heard it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10567">How do we define the art of film? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10568">How do we analyze it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10569">How do we craft our movies so they are more than mere flashing images on the screen, but become what Renoir referred to as “an art form that is larger than life.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10570">We are now living in a time of visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10571">Whether you want to tell a story on the big screen or write a television show that can be downloaded onto an iPod, cell phone, or PDA; whether you want to create a video game or short film; a business plan or a Power-Point presentation for any future delivery system, you have to know the tools and rules of visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10572">That’s what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10573">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10574"> is all about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10575">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10576"> explores the process of writing a screenplay, which is visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10577">I call it a “what-to book,” meaning that if you have an idea for a screenplay, but don’t exactly know what to do to write it, this book will guide you through the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10578">No matter whether it’s a feature, a short film, a commercial, or other form of visual presentation, the book works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10579">Read a chapter, do the exercise at the end of the chapter, and by the end of the book you will have written a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10580">The screenwriting process can be applied to any form of visual storytelling.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10581">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10582"> is based on the screenwriting workshops I have conducted around the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10583">I design and structure these seven-week workshops so students spend the first four weeks preparing to write, and the second three weeks writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10584">The goal of the class (and I’m very big on goals) is to write and complete the First Act, (anywhere from twenty to thirty pages) of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10585">People come into a workshop with a short idea of their story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10586">For example: “My story is about a woman executive on vacation in Hawaii, who meets and has an affair with a young man, then returns home only to learn the relationship doesn’t work.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10587">That simple.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10588">In the first class we talk about the subject of the screenplay, the action and character—basically </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10589">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10590"> happens and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10591">whom</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10592"> it happens to—and discuss the nature of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10593">Their first assignment when they leave the class is to structure their idea, then write a four-page treatment focusing on the ending, the beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10594">I call this the “kick in the ass” exercise because the student is taking an unformed idea and trying to give it form; it very well may be the most difficult pages the participant writes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10595">The second week we talk about character, and how to give the main character a history by writing a character biography, the character’s life from birth up until the time the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10596">They also outline the character’s professional life, personal life, and private life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10597">Their assignment for the next week is to write character biographies of their main character and one or two other major characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10598">The third week we structure the story line of Act I on 3 × 5 cards, and write up a back story, that is, what happens either a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10599">The fourth week we write the first ten pages and the rest of the workshop is devoted to writing approximately ten pages a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10600">At the end of this seven-week session, the student will have completed the First Act of their screenplay, anywhere from twenty to thirty pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10601">We take a short break and then continue into the Second Act Workshop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10602">The goal of this seven-week course is to write and complete Act II of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10603">In the third seven-week workshop they complete Act III and rewrite the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10604">By the end of the three sessions, almost 80 percent of my students complete their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10605">Many have had tremendous success: Anna Hamilton Phelan wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10606">Mask</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10607"> in class, followed soon after with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10608">Gorillas in the Mist;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10609"> John Singleton worked on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10610">Boyz n the Hood</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10611">, followed by </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10612">Poetic Justice;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10613"> Michael Kane wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10614">The Color of Money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10615">, João Emanuel Carneiro worked on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10616">Central Station</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10617"> in the workshop I conducted in Rio de Janeiro; Janus Cercone wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10618">Leap of Faith</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10619"> in class; Randi Mayem Singer did </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10620">Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10621">Doubtfire;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10622"> Carmen Culver, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10623">The Thorn Birds;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10624"> Laura Esquivel adapted her novel </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10625">Like Water for Chocolate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10626"> during my course in Mexico City; and in the same class Carlos Cuarón started exploring the idea of what would later become </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10627">Y Tu Mamá También</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10628">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10629">There are others as well: Todd Graff </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10630">(Used People, Angie)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10631">, Kevin Williamson </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10632">(Scream)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10633">, Todd Robinson </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10634">(White Squall)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10635">, Humanitas Award winner Linda Elstad </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10636">(Divorce Wars)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10637">, and many others.</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10672">A short time ago, I was having dinner with a group of friends, and as is so often the case, the subject turned to movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10673">We talked about films we had seen, films we liked, films we didn’t like, and what we liked or disliked about them, which covered a broad spectrum ranging from the acting performances to the editing and photography to the music, special effects, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10674">We talked about some of the great moments in films, lines of dialogue that still reside in our awareness, and while the conversation was intriguing and stimulating, what I really found so interesting was that nobody made any mention of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10675">It was as if the script didn’t exist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10676">When I mentioned that fact, the only response I got was, “Oh yeah, it was a great script,” and that’s about as far as it went.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10677">I immediately noticed a short pause in the conversation, and then one of the other guests, an actress and television talk show host, mentioned she had written a book and several of her friends wanted her to turn it into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10678">She confessed she felt she needed a “partner” to help her take her novel, her own story, and write it as a screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10679">When I asked why, she explained she was frightened of “confronting” the blank sheet of paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10680">But she had already written the novel, I replied, so how could she be frightened about turning it into a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10681">Was it the form that challenged her? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10682">Or the visual description of images, the sparseness of dialogue, or the structure that frightened her? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10683">We discussed it for a while and as she was trying to explain her feelings, I realized many people have that same fear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10684">Even though she was a published author, she was afraid of dealing with the blank page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10685">She didn’t know exactly what to do or how to go about doing it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10686">This is not such an unusual scenario. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10687">Many people have great ideas for a screenplay but when they actually sit down to write it they are seized by fear and insecurity because they don’t know how to go about actually doing it.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10718">Writing a screenplay is a process—an organic, ever-changing, evolving stage of growth and development. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10719">Screenwriting is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10720">Like all literary arts, whether fiction or nonfiction, plays or short stories, there are definite stages a writer works through while fleshing out an idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10721">The creative process is the same no matter what you’re writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10722">When you sit down to write a screenplay and confront the blank page, you have to know what story you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10723">You only have a hundred and twenty pages to tell your story, and when you begin writing it’s apparent very quickly that you don’t have much room to work with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10724">A screenplay is more like a poem than a novel or play in which you can feel your way through the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10725">James Joyce, the great Irish writer, once wrote that the writing experience is like climbing a mountain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10726">When you’re scaling a mountain, all you can see is the rock directly in front of you and the rock directly behind you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10727">You can’t see where you’re going or where you’ve come from. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10728">The same principle holds true when you’re writing a screenplay; when you’re writing all you can see is what’s in front of you, that is, the page you’re writing and the pages you’ve written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10729">You can’t see anything beyond that.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10735">One of my students in a recent screenwriting workshop was a published novelist and former editor of a major book publisher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10736">She had never written a screenplay before and shared with me that she was somewhat nervous and insecure about writing the script.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10737">When I asked why, she replied that she didn’t know if her story was visual enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10738">She wanted to write a script about an active middle-aged woman who suffers a life-changing traumatic injury, and had doubts about the main character’s confinement to a hospital bed during most of the second act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10739">This raised another concern: would the main character be too passive? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10740">Could the interest in the character’s plight be sustained with this limited sense of visual action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10741">These were all valid, major considerations, requiring significant creative decisions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10742">During her preparation period we had several discussions, talked about the possibilities of opening it up, using the visual components found in the hospital: tests like EEGs, CAT scans, PET scans, and X-rays, and having the action broken up by the arrival of emergency cases and the various activities of the nurses on the floor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10743">I wondered what would happen in the character’s life while she was in the hospital. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10744">I suggested that she could show bits and pieces of the woman’s former life, possibly through dreams and memories, and weave those flashbacks throughout. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10745">Because the main character was so static during the Second Act, she could add several more visuals to the story line about what the woman was thinking and feeling.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10746">Feeling more secure, my student began preparing her material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10747">She did her research, structured the First Act on cards, wrote up the back story, designed the opening sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10748">As a novelist, she had always researched her ideas thoroughly and gradually, and it would be through the actual writing experience that she would find her story and characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10749">She told me she did not want to know “too much” because, in her experience, she wanted to let the story guide her to where it wants to go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10750">I replied that you can do this when you’re writing a novel or play, but not when you’re writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10751">A screenplay is a specific form; approximately one hundred twenty pages in length and knowing the end is always the first step in writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10752">You can “feel” your way through a four-hundred-fifty-page novel, or a one-hundred-page play, but not a screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10753">A screenplay follows a definite, lean, tight, narrative line of action, with a definite beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10754">A screenplay always moves forward toward the resolution, even if it is told in flashback like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10755">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10756"> (Tony Gilroy), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10757">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10758"> (Alan Ball.) A screenplay follows a singular line of action so every scene, every fragment of visual information, must be taking you somewhere, moving the narrative forward in terms of story development.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10759">This was somewhat difficult for my student to understand because it was unlike her previous writing experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10760">But after she had done her preparation, when she knew her structure and had done some background character work, she was ready to start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10761">She began writing the first act, the emphasis on the professional life of her main character, an active and dynamic woman responding to the challenges of the workplace with energy and integrity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10762">As a professional woman, it was clear her character was active, likable, and well drawn.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10763">But when the main character entered the hospital after the traumatic injury at the end of Act I, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10764">tone</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10765"> of the story changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10766">The character was now confined to a hospital bed, weaving in and out of consciousness for several pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10767">Feeling the story becoming boring, my student became insecure and started looking for new cinematic areas to explore rather than focusing on the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10768">One day she called to tell me she was writing new scenes with doctors and nurses, then told me she had a sudden inspiration to bring in the main character’s daughter, an executive who always seemed to have trouble dealing with authoritarian male figures like doctors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10769">I told her to go ahead and try it; after all, if it works, it works, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10770">All she would really lose was about three days of writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10771">So she began writing this new character, the daughter, in Act II, and then another problem began to surface: the daughter was emerging as the dominant character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10772">The mother, the main character, now seemed to be lost somewhere in a hospital room. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10773">By making the daughter the active force, or voice, in the story, my student had shifted the focus of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10774">The story was now about a daughter taking charge of the health and well-being of her mother.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10775">That raised another issue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10776">The story now hinged on the idea of “a durable power of attorney for a health issue,” an interesting premise in medical therapy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10777">The daughter was asked to choose the medical treatment for her incapacitated mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10778">The doctors told her there were two choices: electric shock treatments to jolt her mother out of her acute depression, or a regime of antidepressant drug therapy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10779">And the doctors explained that both treatments could give rise to disastrous side effects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10780">What should the daughter do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10781">She was ambivalent about male authority figures, yet was now in a position where she had to make a life-altering decision about her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10782">Seeking counsel and confronting her own feelings, the daughter decided to do nothing; she wanted to wait and see and possibly allow her mother to come out of it on her own. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10783">There were no shock treatments, no drugs, nothing; just patience, time, and understanding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10784">At the end, the mother, through her own will, and the daughter’s help, gradually steps back on the path to health and recovery.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10785">That’s the way my student completed the first words-on-paper draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10786">When I read this first draft, I saw immediately there were two separate stories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10787">One story was the saga of the mother who recovers from her injury to take back control of her own life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10788">The second story dealt with the woman’s daughter who was forced, almost against her will, to take charge of the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10789">And it’s during this challenge that she overcomes her own deep-seated fear of male authority and resolves the formerly strained emotional relationship with her mother.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10790">My student started out writing one story and ended up writing another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10791">This happens quite often but the question remained: Was it the story of the mother or the daughter? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10792">Or both? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10793">Whose story do you tell?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10794">My student didn’t know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10795">One of the things I’ve learned through the years is that when I’m uncertain about what course of action to take, I step back for a while. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10796">When in doubt, do nothing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10797"> is my rule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10798">So I suggested that she put the screenplay aside somewhere for a couple of weeks until she had a new perspective on the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10799">It’s important to note that the issue here was not about the quality of writing, or dialogue, or character depth, or whether it worked or not; the issue was what story the writer wanted to tell. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10800">By moving into the daughter’s domain, she changed her dramatic intention and changed the subject. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10801">I explained that it’s not a question of good or bad, or right or wrong, but whether it was the story she wanted to tell.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10802">She waited a short time, and then, in some doubt and uncertainty, she gave this first words-on-paper draft to a close friend of hers, a literary agent in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10803">Her friend saw that the script needed work, but liked the premise well enough to give it to one of her associates at the office. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10804">He read it and felt the script was “slow, dull, and boring.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10805">It should have more action: “It’s the mother’s story,” he said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10806">“Let’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10807">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10808"> her getting an electric shock treatment; maybe change the opening and have it start at the accident because that would make it more active.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10809">My student came to me, angry and confused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10810">She didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10811">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10812"> to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10813">She kept talking about needing a more active, cinematic opening and I kept telling her that wasn’t the problem; she had to know, creatively, which story she was writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10814">When she first sat down to face the blank page she wanted to tell the mother’s story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10815">She ended up telling the story of the daughter overcoming the constraints of her relationship with her mother focusing on the issue of “the durable power of attorney.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10816">She kept asking me what to do, and I kept telling her she had to make a creative decision about which story she was writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10817">I suggested that before she began to rewrite anything, she rethink her idea from the beginning in order to find the focus and direction of her story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10818">Who and what was her story about?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10819">It’s important to know that there is no “right” or “wrong” in this situation, no judgments about good or bad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10820">The only issue is whether it works or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10821">So, I met her one day at a nearby Coffee Bean and while we sipped our white chocolate dream lattes, I suggested that she fashion her story into the relationship between the mother and the daughter and set it against the dramatic backdrop of her mother’s injury, showing how this brings them together with a stronger bond of love and understanding.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10822">She shook her head and told me this was not the story she’d planned to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10823">The story was about the mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10824">That’s fine, I said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10825">But if she set out to write the story she wanted to write, she had to focus on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10826">that</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10827"> story and integrate it into the relationship with her daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10828">Ultimately, she left the Coffee Bean the same way she came in; lost, confused, and uncertain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10829">She picked away at the script for several months, didn’t feel she was making any progress with it, and finally shelved the project.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10830">It happens all the time; to you, to me, to anyone.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10831">What’s the point of the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10832">Creative problems are part of the landscape of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10833">Either it’s an opportunity to expand the limits of your craft or a way to give in to the fact that “it’s just not working.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10834">My student couldn’t let go of her original concept and while she had a very good story, valid and meaningful, she really didn’t know which story she wanted to tell. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10835">Her mind told her one thing, her creative Self told her another.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10836">What could she have done to solve the problem? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10837">Look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10838">The Sea Inside</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10839"> (Alejandro Amenábar), a story that covers some of the same fertile, emotional, and thought-provoking ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10840">While the main character, Ramón (Javier Bardem) is confined to a hospital bed and room for some 30 years, fighting for his right to die, Amenábar opens up the smothering hospital room with soaring fantasies of Ramón walking and running, dreaming of love, so the story becomes a visual and eloquent testament of our imagination and how it can touch, move, and inspire others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10841">It is possible that my student could have visually opened up her story in order to achieve her artistic intention, but didn’t.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10901">So, where does the writer begin? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10902">The answer is anywhere you want to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10903">There are many ways to approach writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10904">Sometimes you begin with character—a strong, three-dimensional character in an extraordinary situation that moves your story forward with skill and clarity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10905">Character is a good, solid starting point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10906">You can also start with an idea; but an idea is only an idea unless it’s executed properly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10907">You’ve got to take that idea and expand it, clothe it, make it say what you want it to say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10908">“I want to write a story about a man who has a near-death experience” is not enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10909">You’ve got to dramatize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10910">Legally, the law says: “You can’t copyright an idea, only the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10911">expression</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10912"> of the idea.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10913">The “expression” means the specific characters, locations, structure, and action that make up the narrative throughline of the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10914">Sometimes you may want to write a screenplay that deals with an incident, episode, or experience that happened to you or to someone you know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10915">You can use this particular experience as the starting point in your story, but as you go through the preparation process, you’ll find that you want to hold on to the “reality” of the experience; you want to be “true” to the situation or incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10916">Most people find it hard to let go of the experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10917">But often, you’ve got to let the “reality” go in order to dramatize it more effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10918">I liken it to climbing a staircase: The first step is the actual experience, the second step is increasing the dramatic potential of the story, and the third step is integrating both of the previous steps to create a “dramatic reality.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10919">If you remain too true to “who did what” in the “real” order of the experience, it usually ends up as a thin story line with little or no dramatic impact. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10920">Do not feel “obligated” to remain “true” to reality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10921">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10922">The “reality” of the event may, and often does, get in the way of the dramatic needs of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10923">I tell my students over and over again to “let go” of the original source material and simply write what is needed for their story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10924">I call it creating a dramatic reality and liken it to climbing the bottom three rungs of a staircase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10925">The first rung is the reality, the way something really happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10926">But to turn it into effective drama, you might have to add some incidents or events that did not happen; I call it creating an “unreality.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10927">That brings you to the third rung, which I call the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10928">dramatic reality</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10929">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10930">This is where you take the first rung, the reality, add the unreality incidents or elements, and make it a dramatic reality.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11081">Remember, it may take you three or four pages of horrible writing to figure out what story you’re telling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11082">Just work in fragments, or notes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11083">There’s no need to try for complete sentences here. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11084">Trust the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11085">If you’ve written several pages, wandering here and there, go through the material and highlight things that help define the action or character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11086">Take your time with this; you’re taking a vague, general idea, and reducing it to a few sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11087">Sometimes, it helps to give your character a name so you can become more specific. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11088">Read it out loud. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11089">Polish it some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11090">Do it until you are perfectly clear about your subject and can express it clearly and concisely in three or four sentences.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11109">In one of my early screenwriting workshops in Paris where I was presenting structure as the foundation of screenwriting, I was literally booed off the stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11110">They referred to me as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11111">le Diable</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11112"> (the Devil) and claimed no one could write a screenplay using structure as the organizing principle of story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11113">When I confronted them about how they built their own story lines, they replied in vague generalities and hazy abstractions, talking about the “mystery of structure,” or the “ambiguity of the creative process,” as if trying to describe the sun on an overcast day.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11114">I’ve been teaching the craft of screenwriting for more than twenty-five years, and the more I talk about it, the more I understand how important structure is and how much more there is to learn.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11115">When I first started out, I traveled to people’s homes carrying a small white board under my arm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11116">At that time, I can truly say I didn’t understand the significance of building a visual story line, or constructing shots, scenes, and sequences, or formulating a character’s arc and finding ways of documenting the emotional and physical changes in the character as he or she journeys through the landscape of narrative action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11117">Exploring the nature of structure has been a profound and insightful journey for me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11118">I’ve always known that a thorough knowledge and understanding of structure was essential in the writing of a screenplay—I just didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11119">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11120"> important it was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11121">I still find screenwriters all over the world, both professional and amateur, who don’t understand the intrinsic nature of structure and its relationship to the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11122">So what is structure?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11123">According to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11124">Webster’s New World Dictionary</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11125">, there are two definitions of the word “structure.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11126">The root </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11127">struct</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11128">, means, “to put together,” and the first definition is “to build something, like a building or a dam; or to put together.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11129">When we talk about structuring a screenplay, we’re talking about building and putting together all the necessary ingredients that go into the making of a screenplay: the scenes, sequences, characters, action, and so forth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11130">We are building, or constructing, the “content,” or events, which lead us through the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11131">The second definition defines structure as the “relationship between the parts and the whole.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11132">A good illustration is a chess game. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11133">If you want to play a game of chess you need four things: first, you need a chessboard; it could be as big or as small as you want, as large as a football field or as small as a matchbox. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11134">Next, you need the pieces: the king, queen, pawns, bishops, knights, and rooks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11135">The third thing you need are players, and fourth, you need to know the rules. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11136">Without the rules, it’s not a chess game. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11137">Those four elements, the parts, make up the whole of the chess game. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11138">If you take away any one of these parts, there is no chess game. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11139">This is the relationship between the parts and the whole.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11140">Not too long ago it was popular to say that the whole is nothing more than the sum of its parts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11141">That’s no longer true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11142">Modern physics challenges that assumption with the General Systems Theory; a theory that states the whole is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11143">greater</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11144"> than the sum of its parts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11145">There’s an ancient Indian tale about three blind men and an elephant that illustrates this well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11146">Three blind men are asked to describe an elephant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11147">One man feels the trunk and says that an elephant is round, narrow, and flexible, like a snake. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11148">The second blind man feels the midsection and says the elephant is like a wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11149">The third feels the tail and says no, the elephant is like a piece of rope.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11159">Because a screenplay is such a unique form, you have to approach it from a different perspective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11160">What is a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11161">We define a screenplay as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11162">a story told in pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11163">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11201">Several years ago, after I had conducted a European screenwriting workshop in Brussels, I went to visit Venice for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11202">While there, I visited the Accademia Museum, which displays a magnificent collection of early Venetian painting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11203">In the Middle Ages, when monks in the monasteries were transcribing the Scriptures, they enlarged and elaborated the initial letter of a paragraph. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11204">(A similar convention is still followed today in which the first letter of a chapter is set in large type.) It wasn’t long before the monks were illustrating their manuscripts with scenes from the Bible, and soon they were decorating their walls with illustrations similar to Roman frescoes; then these scenes were put on wood panels which leaned against the wall, and this gave way to painting on canvas which then hung on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11205">The Accademia Museum displays a marvelous collection of this early Italian painting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11206">As I wandered around the museum, I was struck by one painting in particular: it was composed of twelve individual wood panels depicting scenes in the life of Christ: one panel showed his birth, another the Sermon on the Mount, another the Last Supper, and then the Crucifixion, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11207">Something about this painting grabbed me and held my interest, and I didn’t know why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11208">I stared at that painting for a long time, thinking about it, then moved away, and found myself coming back to it, intrigued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11209">What made this painting different from all the others? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11210">The answer came immediately: it wasn’t just one painting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11211">It was a series of twelve paintings mounted together to tell the story of the life and death of Christ. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11212">It was a story told in pictures.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11213">It was a profound experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11214">The interaction between the story and picture in each panel was the same as the visual relationship between the story and character in a screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11283">I first became aware of this shift in visual storytelling in 1995. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11284">I had been teaching the nature of structure in workshops all over the world for almost twenty years when I saw three films that radically changed my perception. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11285">The first was </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11286">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11287"> (Quentin Tarantino), and though I thought it was a “B” movie in terms of content, I saw immediately it was a new departure in storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11288">Everywhere I went in the world, people wanted to talk about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11289">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11290">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11291">In many of my workshops, the participants asked if the film represented a new structure, and wanted to hear my opinion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11292">People “dared” me to analyze it in terms of my structural paradigm; everybody, it seemed, thought </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11293">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11294"> was </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11295">it;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11296"> innovative in thought, concept, and execution, everything a revolutionary film should be.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11297">A few months later, I was in Mexico City conducting a screenwriting workshop for the Mexican government when I was invited to see a new film by the noted Mexican director, Jorge Fons, called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11298">El Callejón de los Milagros</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11299"> (Midaq Alley) featuring Salma Hayek in one of her first major film roles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11300">The film seemed more novelistic than cinematic to me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11301">There were four stories in the film, each one revolving around four or five different characters, all living, working, and loving on the same street, but linked by a key incident that shatters the relationship between the two main characters, a father and son. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11302">The incident affects all the characters in some way, and is woven into the structure as characters and events sometimes fold back on themselves in flashbacks of memories almost like a novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11303">The film, though high in melodrama, is unique, striking in terms of concept and execution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11304">The more I thought about it, the more it seemed these two films were a kind of an indicator, or marker, influencing a possible future form of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11305">As I studied these two films, I understood once again what Jean Renoir called the “relationship between things.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11306">Somehow, I sensed, there was a connection between the way a story is laid out in linear progression, and the way it’s laid out in a nonlinear presentation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11307">Shortly after I returned, I was invited to a screening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11308">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11309"> (Anthony Minghella). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11310">I loved it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11311">The way the past and present are fused into one organic story line captivated me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11312">What do these three films all have in common? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11313">I asked myself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11314">I started from the obvious: even though they are all nonlinear in their stylistic approach, all have a beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11315">I remembered a line from the great Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11316">Three Sisters</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11317"> that has always stayed with me: “The principle thing in life is its form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11318">That which loses its form, ends itself, and it’s the same with our everyday existence.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11319">Everything in life has a form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11320">Every twenty-four-hour period is exactly the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11321">The day begins in the morning, goes into the afternoon, and is followed by night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11322">You can make further distinctions with that of course: early morning, later afternoon, late night, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11323">It’s the same with the twelve-month period we label a year; it’s always the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11324">The same with our seasons: there is spring, summer, fall, and winter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11325">It never changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11326">It’s always the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11327">Remember the riddle that Sophocles presented for Oedipus: he asks what walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11328">The answer: A human being.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11329">All these questions led me to believe that there was something in these films that I needed to explore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11330">I started with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11331">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11332">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11333">I got a copy of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11334">When I read the title page, it said that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11335">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11336"> was really “three stories…about one story.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11337">I turned the page and read two dictionary definitions of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11338">pulp:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11339"> “a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter,” and “a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11340">That’s certainly an accurate description of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11341">But on the third page, I was surprised to find a Table of Contents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11342">I thought that was rather odd; who writes a Table of Contents for a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11343">Then I saw the film was broken down into five individual parts: Part I, the Prologue; Part II, Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace’s Wife; Part III, The Gold Watch; Part IV, The Bonnie Situation; and Part V, the Epilogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11344">As I studied the script, I saw that all three stories bounce off the key incident of Jules and Vincent Vega retrieving Marsellus Wallace’s briefcase from the four guys. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11345">This one incident became the hub of all three stories, and each story is structured as a whole, in linear fashion; it starts at the beginning of the action, goes into the middle, and then proceeds to the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11346">Each section is like a short story, presented from a different character’s point of view.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11347">If this key incident is the hub of the story, as I now understood it, then all the actions, reactions, thoughts, memories, or flashbacks, are tethered to this one incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11348">The entire film is structured around this one event, and then branches off in three different directions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11349">Suddenly, it all made sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11350">Understanding “three stories about one story” allowed me to see the film as one unified whole. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11351">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11352"> is three stories surrounded by a prologue and epilogue, what screenwriters call a “bookend” technique: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11353">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11354"> uses that same device. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11355">So do </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11356">The Bridges of Madison County</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11357"> (Richard LaGravenese), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11358">Sunset Boulevard</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11359"> (Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett), and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11360">Saving Private Ryan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11361"> (Robert Rodat).</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11362">Now I began to see how </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11363">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11364"> was put together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11365">The Prologue sets up the two characters, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), in a coffee shop discussing various types of robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11366">When they finish their meals, they pull their guns and rob the place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11367">The film freezes and we cut to the main titles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11368">Then we cut into the middle of a conversation between Jules (Samuel L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11369">Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta), driving and having an enlightening discussion about the relative merits of a Big Mac both here and abroad.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11370">Part I sets up the entire film and tells us everything we need to know; the two men are killers working for Marsellus Wallace; their job, their dramatic need, is to retrieve the briefcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11371">That’s the true beginning of the story, and by this reckoning, in Part I, Jules and Vincent arrive, state their position, kill the three guys, and only by the grace of God do they leave alive with Marvin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11372">That’s the key incident of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11373">They report back to Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11374">Vinnie takes Mia (Uma Thurman) out to dinner, and after she accidentally overdoses on some heroin, he revives her and they say good night, promising not to share what happened with anyone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11375">Part II is about Butch (Bruce Willis) and his gold watch and what happens when he wins the fight, killing the other fighter, instead of losing it like he had agreed with Marsellus Wallace in Part I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11376">Part III deals with cleaning up Marvin’s remains, which are splattered all over the car—a continuation of Part I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11377">That’s followed by the Epilogue where Jules talks about his transformation and the significance of Divine Intervention in their lives, and then Pumpkin and Honey Bunny resume the holdup that began the film in the Prologue.</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11509">A screenplay is unique: as a story told in pictures, utilizing both dialogue and description to move the story forward, the narrative line is held together within the context of a dramatic structure that anchors the story line in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11510">There is a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11511">We spoke about context as being “the space” that holds something in place, that something being the content—all those scenes, sequences, action, dialogue, characters, and more, that make up the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11512">Context doesn’t change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11513">Content changes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11514">Structure is form.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11515">“A screenplay,” as William Goldman says, “is structure, structure, structure.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11516">To illustrate the context of structure—what it looks like—we build a model, just like an architect builds a model to scale so we can “see” what a building looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11517">We build the context of dramatic structure by illustrating it with the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11518">A paradigm is defined as “a model, an example, or a conceptual scheme.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11519">It is really a tool or guideline, a roadmap through the story of the screenwriting process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11520">The more I learn about the paradigm, the more amazed I am at how important it really is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11521">I conceived the paradigm after writing nine original screenplays and reading in excess of two thousand screenplays and more than a hundred novels looking for material during my stint as head of the story department at Cinemobile Systems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11522">Most of what I read was not very good; as a matter of fact, I only found forty out of two thousand screenplays to submit to our financial partners. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11523">Since then, I have read, analyzed, and worked with screenwriters on thousands and thousands of screenplays in several different languages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11524">The one thing that all good screenplays have in common is structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11525">Structure is like a system; in science, systems are referred to as either being open or closed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11526">A closed system is like a rock—it takes nothing from its environment and gives nothing back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11527">There is no interchange between the rock and whatever its surroundings may be.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11528">An open system is like a city: it interacts with its environment, and there exists a natural interchange between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11529">The city depends on the earth of the surrounding areas for food and raw materials, and people in those areas depend upon the city for jobs, trade, and other services. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11530">There is a give-and-take exchange between the city and its surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11531">Writing a screenplay is very much an open system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11532">You plan what you’re going to write—for example, “Grace leaves Bill’s apartment and takes a long walk through the city”—but sometimes it doesn’t work out that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11533">Grace “tells” you she doesn’t want to go on a long walk through the city—she wants to listen to music, go dancing, have an apple martini, and be around people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11534">And if that ever happens, you better listen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11535">That spark of spontaneity that jolts an unexpected image or thought or sequence or line of dialogue is what makes the creative process an open system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11536">But you’ve got to be open to receive the new ideas and allow the process to emerge from your creative self. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11537">You can’t let any preconceived notions or ideas hamper you from taking another direction in the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11538">The writing experience should always be an adventure, and we’re never really quite sure how the creative process is going to reveal itself to us.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11539">That’s what teaching is all about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11540">It, too, is an open system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11541">The teacher presents the material to the students; they listen, question, doubt, argue, and assimilate whatever connects with them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11542">The way they listen can create a possible breakthrough in the understanding of craft, or an expansion of the original material, which in turn could evolve into the story taking a new direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11543">If we’re open to the process, the story may take an unseen “twist,” expanding the story line or characters, even adding new characters and subplots. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11544">The structure of the story may even change.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11545">Over the years, I’ve defined the paradigm in many ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11546">If we could hang a screenplay on the wall like a painting, we could “see” what it looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11547">For example, if you wanted to illustrate the paradigm of a table how would you define it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11548">What is a table? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11549">A top with four legs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11550">But that covers a lot of ground; there are many different types of tables: a short table, long table, high table, low table, or narrow table. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11551">There can also be a square table, round table, rectangular table, or octagonal table. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11552">You could also have a chrome table, wrought-iron table, wood table, glass table, plastic table, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11553">As you can see, the paradigm of a table does not change; it is “a top with four legs.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11554">That is its nature; that’s the model of a table.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11555">If you’re building a new house, or remodeling an old one, you hire an architect or designer to draw blueprints, preliminary plans, and working plans. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11556">But if you’re like I am, you may have trouble visualizing what the house is going to look like when it’s finished based only on a blueprint. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11557">Lines on paper do not really show you the walls, doors, and ceilings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11558">Some of us need to see a model before we can make any kind of aesthetic decision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11559">It doesn’t matter whether it’s a house, office building, swimming pool, tennis court, car, bus, or boat, sometimes we just need to see it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11560">In other words, we need a model.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11561">In the same way, the paradigm is a model, an example, a conceptual scheme of what a screenplay looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11562">If we could hang it on the wall like a painting, and see it in its wholeness, this it what it would look like:</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11564">Let’s explore the context of the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11565">Here’s how it works: If a screenplay is “a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure,” what is a story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11566">And what do all stories have in common?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11567">A beginning, middle, and end—though as mentioned, not always in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11568">Because we’re dealing with a dramatic medium, the beginning corresponds to Act I, the middle to Act II, the end to Act III.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11569">The average length of a film is about two hours long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11570">Since one page of screenplay equals approximately one minute of screen time, the average screenplay is about one hundred and twenty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11571">Some are longer, some shorter, but most are close to this length. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11572">The contracts being written by most major Hollywood studios and production companies today usually stipulate that movies in production cannot be longer than two hours, eight minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11573">That means approximately one hundred and twenty-eight pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11574">And you are not the exception.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11575">You may want to check this out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11576">Read a screenplay, then see the movie and determine if it’s true or not! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11577">Check your watch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11578">You should be reading as many screenplays as you can to familiarize yourself with the visual presentation of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11579">If you’re seriously interested in writing a screenplay, you should be reading all the scripts you can get your hands on, and seeing all the movies you can afford—in a movie theater, if possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11580">If not, then rent or buy the DVD.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11581">If you don’t have access to any screenplays, go online and search the Web. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11582">There are many Web sites devoted to the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11583">At some sites, you can download scripts free of charge—sites like </span><i class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4" href="http://simplyscripts.com"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11584">simplyscripts.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11585"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4" href="http://Script-O-Rama.com"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11586">Drew’s Script-O-Rama.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11587"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4" href="http://dailyscript.com"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11588">dailyscript.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11589">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11590">Or, do a Google or Yahoo search for “screenplays” and see what comes up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11591">There are many, many sites and many, many screenplays you can download.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11592">It breaks down this way: Aristotle states there are three unities of action—time, place, and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11593">Act I is a unit of dramatic (or comedic) action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11594">It begins at the beginning, page one, with the opening shot or sequence, and goes through to the end of Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11595">It is approximately twenty to thirty pages long and is held together by the dramatic context known as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11596">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11597">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11598">Act II is a unit of dramatic action that begins at the end of Plot Point I and extends through the end of Plot Point II, and it is approximately fifty or sixty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11599">It is held together by the dramatic context known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11600">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11601">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11602">Act II is all about conflict and obstacles confronted and overcome. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11603">All drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action, and without action, you have no character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11604">Without character, you have no story, and without story, you ain’t got no screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11605">If you know your character’s dramatic need—that is, what he or she wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay—then you can create obstacles to that need and your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11606">Act III is also a unit of dramatic or comedic action; it goes from the end of Plot Point II, approximately page eighty or ninety, to the end of the screenplay, roughly page one hundred and twenty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11607">It, too, is roughly twenty to thirty pages long and is held together with the dramatic context known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11608">Resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11609">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11610">It’s important to remember that resolution means solution and in this unit of action your story is resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11611">Not necessarily wrapped up neatly, but complete in whatever way you choose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11612">In this, the preparation, or preplanning stage of writing the screenplay, what you need to know about the resolution of your story is basically what happens to your character at the end of the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11613">Does your character live or die, succeed or fail, win the race or not, return safely home or not, get married or divorced? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11614">Resolution means solution and Act III is all about how your story is resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11615">If you don’t know how to resolve your story, ask yourself how </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11616">you would like it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11617"> to be resolved, regardless of how effective it is, or whether “they”—those unknown film executives who live in your head—would like it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11618">It’s your story so you get to choose how it’s going to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11619">And that will be your starting point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11620">When Stuart Beattie was preparing his script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11621">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11622">, he knew that Max (Jamie Foxx) had to stand up to the hired killer to save his life as well as to redeem himself; otherwise, he would just be another murder statistic on the streets of L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11623">That’s the character arc that Max had to go through in order to realize that his “someday dream” would never happen unless he made it happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11624">Beattie structured the evolution of the character just like he did the story and it’s a good illustration of using the paradigm as a structural template.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11625">In many films, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11626">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11627"> (Alan Ball), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11628">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11629"> (Tony Gilroy), Act I is anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11630">We’re not talking numbers here, we’re talking </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11631">form:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11632"> beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11633">Act II can be anywhere from fifty to sixty pages, plus or minus a few pages, and there are times when Act III is fifteen to twenty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11634">The paradigm, remember, is only a model, an example or conceptual scheme. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11635">It’s not something that’s laid down in concrete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11636">As a matter of fact, the great thing about structure is that it’s fluid; like a tree in the wind, it bends, but doesn’t break.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11637">Act I is a unit of dramatic action that sets up your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11638">In the first twenty to thirty pages of screenplay, you must set up your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11639">You must introduce your main characters, establish your dramatic premise (what the story is about), create the dramatic situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and set up the relationships between your character’s professional life, his or her personal life (relationships), and his or her private life (private time and hobbies). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11640">Most, if not all, of these elements need to be established in this first unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11641">Everything in Act I focuses on setting up your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11642">You don’t have time for cheap tricks or clever scenes or cute dialogue if they don’t move the story forward, establish the relationships between the characters, or reveal information about the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11643">You’ve got to set up your story immediately, from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11644">The purpose of each scene is either to move the story forward or reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11645">Anything that does not serve these two functions should be dropped. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11646">Act I sets up the story and holds each scene and sequence in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11647">Context, remember, is the space that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11648">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11649"> the content in place; all those scenes, dialogue, description, shots, and special effects that make up a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11650">Everything in this unit of action sets up everything that will follow.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11651">A perfect example is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11652">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11653"> (Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11654">After the brief prologue establishing the history of the Ring, we follow Gandalf as he enters the Shire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11655">There, we meet Frodo, Bilbo Baggins, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, and see the Hobbit’s life in the Shire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11656">We learn that Bilbo found the Ring, wants to leave the Shire to write his book, and uses the Ring to disappear from his birthday party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11657">That causes Gandalf to research the history of the Ring, and soon realizes the danger that the Ring brings with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11658">Already, the dark horsemen of Sauron are searching the Shire for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11659">Frodo reluctantly inherits the Ring when Bilbo vanishes and Gandalf convinces Frodo of the need to leave the Shire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11660">So Frodo and Sam set out on their journey—their mission: to travel to Mordor, land of the enemy, and destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11661">The act of Frodo and Sam leaving the relative safety of the Shire now takes us into Act II where they encounter obstacle after obstacle before they reach their journey’s end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11662">(As a side note, the context of Part II, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11663">The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11664">, is all about confrontation and the overcoming of obstacles.) Everything is set up in this first unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11665">We establish relationships between the main characters: we know who the main character is (Frodo), what the story is about (destroying the Ring in the fire), and what the dramatic situation is (Sauron, rallying the forces of evil to destroy Middle Earth).</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11729">Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11730">A Plot Point can be anything you want it to be as long as it moves the action forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11731">It is a function of character, leading us from Act I into Act II or from Act II into Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11732">It should be noted here that there can be many Plot Points in your screenplay but at this stage in the writing process, the preparation, we are only focusing on Plot Points I and II; they are the anchor points that hold the elements of your story line in place.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11733">Before you can write one word on paper, you must know four things: your ending, your beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11734">Only when you know these four elements can you start to “build” or structure your story line.</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11928">Not too long ago, I was taking a yoga class with a well-known television actor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11929">We started talking and after a while the subject, as always, turned to the movies, then to screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11930">He told me that he had a great idea for a screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11931">“What’s it about?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11932">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11933">“Well,” he began, “it’s about this guy in the Sahara Desert. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11934">We open at sunrise with a long shot of dust rising out of the desert. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11935">Then we see a Jeep racing across the sand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11936">Suddenly, the engine sputters, coughs, and finally dies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11937">The man climbs out of the Jeep, looks around, and jerks open the hood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11938">Then we hear strange noises coming from behind a distant dune. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11939">Suddenly, several racing camels sweep down over the hill. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11940">They see him and stop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11941">They look at each other surrounded by the silence.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11942">He looked at me, enthused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11943">“Isn’t that a great idea?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11944">“It’s a great opening,” I replied. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11945">“What happens next?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11946">“I haven’t figured it out yet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11947">But it’ll all come out later, in the plot.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11948">Sure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11949">How many times have you heard that before? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11950">What plot?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11951">I nodded in understanding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11952">Yeah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11953">Sure.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11954">I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard that same scenario from aspiring screenwriters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11955">Of course, they can’t tell you any more about the story because they don’t know any more about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11956">They haven’t defined it to themselves yet.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11957">What’s it about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11958">Briefly, in terms of describing the story line, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11959">what’s</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11960"> your story about, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11961">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11962"> is it about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11963">Can you define it, articulate it in a few sentences? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11964">It’s something I emphasize over and over again in my workshops and seminars:</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11965">“If you don’t know your story, who does?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11966">Writing a screenplay is more about the journey than the destination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11967">It is an ongoing, evolving process that changes day to day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11968">You prepare the material in stages or steps. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11969">First, you need an idea, which is broken down into a subject, the action and character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11970">Then, when you have your subject, you can structure it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11971">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11972"> with the four anchoring points that hold your story together: the ending, beginning, Plot Points I and II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11973">You really can’t write anything with any degree of certainty until you know those four things; they are the foundation of your story line, the glue that holds your story together.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11974">Only when you know these four elements can you begin to tell your story in a narrative fashion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11975">In fact, the word “narrative” means an arrangement, or sequence of events or happenings, factual or imagined, and implies a sense of direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11976">The story progresses from beginning to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11977">And direction, remember, is a line of development.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11978">Putting your story down on paper is essential because it’s a necessary stage in fleshing out and developing your idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11979">How accurate it will be in terms of the finished screenplay five or six months from now, or how good or bad it is, is totally irrelevant.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11980">That’s why I think it’s necessary to write a short, four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11981">A treatment is defined as a narrative synopsis of your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11982">Some dialogue can be included if it helps to shed light upon the lives of your characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11983">I have my students write four-page treatments because it helps articulate and define the structural events that hold the story together.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11984">Why is this necessary? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11985">Because it allows you to take those unformed, fragmented ideas that are running around your head and put them down on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11986">It sharpens the details of your story and clarifies the relationships you’ve been thinking about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11987">I call this a “kick in the ass” exercise, because you’re taking this amorphous idea, or notion, and trying to give it form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11988">It’s an important step in the screenwriting process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11989">It should be mentioned that in Hollywood, a treatment, any kind of a treatment, is only a writer’s tool; it’s just part of the ongoing journey of writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11990">Writing a treatment and hoping it will sell, is only a pipe dream. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11991">A treatment is not a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11992">Don’t expect the treatment you write to be sold, or optioned, especially if you’re a new or aspiring screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11993">In television, it’s a different story; there, treatments, or beat sheets, or outlines, may be developed in conjunction with the production executive and the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11994">But we’re talking about screenplays here, and in Hollywood only a finished screenplay can be sent out to studios and production companies.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11995">It’s also a different story in Europe and in some Latin American countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11996">In Europe, for example, a treatment is often sold or optioned by members of the Film Commission or Ministry of Culture, and then the writer is given a nominal sum of money to develop the treatment into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11997">What happens to the screenplay after it’s written, of course, is anybody’s guess. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11998">Sometimes, the treatment is optioned, a screenplay written, and then it simply sits on a shelf somewhere gathering dust for whatever reason—a director is not available or doesn’t like the material or the budget is too high or there’s been a change in the policy or members of the Film Commission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11999">Whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12000">I hear this over and over and over again from European and Latin American screenwriters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12001">The stories are legion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12002">Writing a four-page treatment is not something you have to do, but if you take the time to prepare your material correctly, it pays off during the actual writing process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12003">I learned this the hard way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12004">When I was making documentaries for David L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12005">Wolper, I was a staff writer and wrote, produced, researched, directed, or was associated with more than 125 television network documentaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12006">After four and a half years, I felt it was time for a change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12007">I left Wolper Productions and went looking for a job in feature film production, actively seeking a job as a production executive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12008">But nothing was available at the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12009">Things were tight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12010">Then, after several months, I was asked to rewrite a documentary feature, called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12011">Spree</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12012">, directed by Walon Green, whom I had worked with at Wolper Productions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12013">Now the Executive Producer of TV’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12014">Law &amp; Order</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12015">, Walon had co-written </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12016">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12017"> with Sam Peckinpah, the writer–director who was a mentor to me and who had been so instrumental in my understanding of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12018">After writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12019">Spree</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12020">, I realized I could possibly earn a living as a writer while waiting for some kind of a production job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12021">So, I became a screenwriter living the life of a freelancer—a job here, a job there, just enough to make ends meet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12022">It went on like this for the next seven years, during which time I wrote nine original screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12023">Two were produced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12024">The next four scripts I wrote were optioned, meaning a producer paid me a certain sum of money so he or she had the exclusive right to produce the movie for a certain length of time, usually two years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12025">At the end of that period, the rights reverted back to me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12026">The three others I wrote went nowhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12027">Everybody told me how much they liked them, but nothing happened with them and they still sit on my shelf. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12028">“Hollywood,” said novelist Dorothy Parker, “is the only place where you can die from encouragement.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12029">The way I worked was simple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12030">I would get an idea and research it—get books from the library and talk to people about it until I felt comfortable with the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12031">Then I would do my character work, write character biographies, talk to more people, look at pictures, read any first-hand accounts from diaries of that period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12032">Next I would sit down and start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12033">I used to call it “hitting my head against the typewriter.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12034">I always came up with a script, but the cost, both physically and emotionally, was very high. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12035">It was a slow and painful process, and after years of working this way, I began to look at screenwriting as something I </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12036">had</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12037"> to do rather than something I </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12038">wanted</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12039"> to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12040">There’s a big difference between the two; one is a negative experience, the other positive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12041">While it’s important to see both sides, writing is too hard a job, too demanding a task, to color it with a negative or painful experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12042">One of the scripts I wrote during this time was a painful, but ultimately beneficial experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12043">It was a western about a man named Balinger who rode with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, an “unchanged man in a changing time,” as Peckinpah used to say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12044">But when Butch and Sundance left for South America in 1902, my character, Balinger, refused to believe the times were changing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12045">He stayed behind, pulled a couple of holdups, was caught, sentenced to prison, escaped, and continued to do the only thing he knew how to do: rob banks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12046">Balinger was a character who was at odds with the times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12047">On one hand, he was born ten years too late; on the other, he was born ten years too early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12048">That was the basic idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12049">He was a character who didn’t belong.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12050">In the back story, Balinger robs a bank, gets caught, and is sentenced to prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12051">I wanted to open the script with an exciting sequence of Balinger escaping from prison, having served four years of a ten-year sentence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12052">After he escapes, he teams up with his old partner, adds a few young members to his gang, and begins to pursue his old way of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12053">But of course, times have changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12054">Banks have started using checks, stocks and bonds are negotiable securities, and with something called the telephone you could call from Denver to San Francisco. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12055">Balinger couldn’t understand that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12056">After planning a robbery, his expectations are thwarted because nothing works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12057">In one job he gets a bundle of checks, along with a thousand dollar bill he can’t cash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12058">Another job nets only a few hundred dollars in coins and some stock certificates.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12059">At this point, he doesn’t know what to do or where to go, and the Pinkerton detectives chasing him are closing in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12060">Balinger knows his time is at an end and talks about joining Butch and Sundance in Bolivia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12061">One last job—a big one, he thinks—will do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12062">So, the motley group rides to a town in Washington State, on the banks of Puget Sound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12063">They pull the job, but in the ensuing shoot-out, the money is left behind and Balinger chooses to end his own life by deliberately colliding with the Coast Guard cutter chasing him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12064">His last words were something like, “Maybe Butch and Sundance had the right idea.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12065">That’s about all I knew when I sat down in “the pit” and started writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12066">But this time, “hitting my head against the typewriter” didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12067">Or, I should say, it worked for about thirty pages, and after that I went into a state of confusion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12068">I didn’t know what happened or what to do or where to go, and after struggling with the story line for several weeks, I plunged into the infamous writer’s block.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12069">It was awful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12070">To help me, I started doing a lot of drugs, but instead of finding my story I simply got further and further away from it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12071">I became angry, despondent, and frustrated, then surrendered to a deep depression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12072">It went on for several weeks, until I became frightened, and stopped taking everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12073">Cold turkey.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12074">A few days later a friend of mine, then the story editor for a major production company, called and we went out to dinner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12075">During the course of the meal I shared the problem with him and he asked a very simple question: “What’s your story about?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12076">I looked at him dumbfounded. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12077">In all my despair and pain and depression over my “writing block,” I had forgotten all about my story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12078">It was the first time I had been asked to tell the story, to describe it out loud.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12079">I stammered awhile, trying to remember what it was about, and finally managed to blurt out the basic idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12080">He listened, asked some pertinent questions, made some suggestions, and told me he wanted to see something in writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12081">I agreed, and when I returned that night, I sat down and wrote a short treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12082">I couldn’t believe what happened—as soon as I knew my story, my writer’s block vanished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12083">That’s when I suddenly understood: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12084">“The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write.”</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12085">That experience taught me how important it is to know your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12086">In all my screenwriting workshops and seminars across the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and South America, I continually stress the fact that you must know your story before you can write anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12087">And it all starts when you’re able to take the four elements, the ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II, and structure them into a dramatic story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12088">Why a four-page treatment and not ten or twenty pages?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12089">Because at this stage you really don’t know much about your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12090">You only have a general idea of an action and character, and a general basis for your plot, as well as the four anchoring points: ending, beginning, Plot Points I and II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12091">That’s all you know about your story at this point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12092">You don’t know what the purpose of a particular scene is or what part it plays in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12093">You probably don’t even know whether it moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12094">Most of us don’t have the answers to these kinds of questions at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12095">We have to frame in the story line, anchor it in the foundation of narrative.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12096">The treatment helps set you up for the actual writing of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12097">So, when you’re writing this short, four-page treatment, don’t get carried away with excessive detail. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12098">Adding in too much detail now does not serve your best interests.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12210">Something else to take into account: if your character’s dramatic need changes at Plot Point I, be clear on what the new dramatic need is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12211">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12212">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12213">, the two women start out for a weekend holiday, but after killing the would-be rapist, their dramatic need changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12214">Now, they are two women wanted for questioning who are running from the police.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12215">With just three dramatic elements, the opening, Act I, and Plot Point I, you’re up to a page and a half of a four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12216">Not bad for just two scenes or sequences.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12217">We’ve completed Act I so now you’re ready to move on into Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12218">Act II is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately sixty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12219">It begins at the end of Plot Point I and goes to the end of Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12220">It is held together with the dramatic context known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12221">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12222">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12223">If you know your character’s dramatic need—what he or she wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay—you can create obstacles to that need and then your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle (or not overcoming them) to achieve his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12224">Remember, all drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12225">Without conflict you have no action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12226">Without action, you have no character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12227">Without character, you have no story, and without story you have no screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12228">So think about Act II for a moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12229">Your character is going to be encountering conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12230">Conflict means “in opposition to,” so what does your character encounter? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12231">It’s important to note that there are two types of conflict: External conflict, where a force is working against the dramatic need of the characters, like being pursued or pursuing someone, being captured by an enemy, trying to survive during a natural disaster, overcoming a physical injury, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12232">Then there’s internal conflict, such as fear, whether it’s fear of failure, fear of success, or fear of intimacy or commitment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12233">An internal conflict can become an impediment to the character’s action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12234">It is an emotional force within the character that interferes with his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12235">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12236"> (Anthony Minghella) is a good example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12237">Inman, the Jude Law character, is wounded during the Civil War and taken to a hospital behind the lines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12238">In flashback and voiceover narration, we see and hear about his relationship with Ada (Nicole Kidman). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12239">She wants him to “come back to me,” so Inman deserts the Confederate Army and starts his physical and emotional journey back to Cold Mountain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12240">The community of Cold Mountain is not only a physical town, but also an emotional place in the heart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12241">Inman has to overcome all kinds of obstacles, including weather, enemy soldiers, capture, and being hunted by the Confederate Police to serve his dramatic need: returning to Cold Mountain and Ada. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12242">The obstacles he confronts during Act II are both internal and external, and bring drama and tension as he attempts to survive the journey home.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12243">Ada’s conflict is also both internal and external. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12244">She has been raised with the skills and qualities of a “lady”—she can play the piano, be a premiere hostess at church gatherings, read, and be a personable companion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12245">But, she doesn’t know the first thing about surviving on the farm after her father dies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12246">She must deal with the internal frustration of not knowing what she has to do to survive, mending fences or planting crops or just fending for herself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12247">Most of the time we encounter both internal and external conflicts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12248">So, as you prepare to describe the action that takes place in Act II, it’s a good idea to sketch out some of the obstacles your character may confront.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12249">First, take a separate sheet of paper, and list four obstacles your character confronts during Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12250">Do you know what they are? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12251">Can you define and articulate them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12252">Are they internal obstacles or external? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12253">Think about it and when you’re ready, just list them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12254">Ask yourself whether these four obstacles generate a sense of dramatic conflict within the progression of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12255">If your story is about a botanist in the Grand Canyon, possible obstacles might include the dangers of running the white-water rapids; succumbing to the tremendous heat; or a physical hardship, such as a severe ankle strain or a broken bone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12256">It could be the raft overturning, losing supplies, or friction between the other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12257">Select four conflicts, either internal or external, or some combination of both, but always making sure they are obstacles that confront your character and that move the story forward to the Plot Point at the end of Act II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12258">When that’s complete, go back to your treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12259">In a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12260">narrative synopsis</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12261">, summarize the action of Act II in a page, using these four conflicts as the anchoring points of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12262">Just follow your character as he or she confronts each obstacle, and then summarize the obstacle in about a quarter of a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12263">It’s important to generate a dramatic flow to the material at this point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12264">Focus on your character confronting and overcoming these obstacles and simply describe the action—that is, what happens—in broad strokes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12265">As mentioned, you’ll find that if you spend too much time on the specific details of the action, you’ll wind up with something like eight pages, not four. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12266">So, keep the material general; at this stage, too much detail is the enemy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12267">When you finish, you should have written about two and a half pages, and you’re ready to write the Plot Point at the end of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12268">What is Plot Point II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12269">Can you describe it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12270">Dramatize it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12271">In a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12272">dramatic recreation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12273">, write Plot Point II in about half a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12274">If you want, use a few lines of dialogue if necessary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12275">How does the Plot Point at the end of Act II “spin” the action around into Act III? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12276">Keep the story flowing smoothly without regard to the specifics of the narrative. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12277">Again, your tendency will probably be to add detail, so watch for it and don’t get caught up in it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12278">You’ll know when you’re starting to overthink it because you’ll find yourself spending time trying to decide exactly </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12279">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12280"> it happens, what the character’s specific motivation is, what kind of car he’s driving, or which job or location to use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12281">Just let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12282">You don’t need too much character motivation for this exercise.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12319">In half a page—a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12320">dramatic recreation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12321"> of the Plot Point at the end of Act II;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12322">In half a page—a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12323">narrative synopsis</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12324"> of the action in Act III, the Resolution;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12325">Then, in half a page—write a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12326">dramatic recreation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12327"> of the ending scene or sequence of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12328">That’s a four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12329">It looks like a story, reads like a story, but it’s only a treatment of what your story line is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12330">It’s something you can register at the Writers Guild of America, West or East, and it is the “proof of authorship.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12331">You can register it online at </span><a class="calibre4" href="http://www.wga.org"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12332">www.wga.org</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12333"> and click on registration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12334">As of this writing, it costs $20 for a nonmember and $10 for a member. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12335">Registering the treatment allows you to claim authorship of your story as of the date it’s registered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12336">It’s not necessary to copyright your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12337">If you want, you can also send the four-page treatment to yourself, certified, with a return receipt requested, but do not open the envelope when you receive it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12338">Writing these four pages is what I call “the kick in the ass” exercise; they may be the toughest pages you’ll write during the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12339">You are taking an unformed and undefined idea, arbitrarily choosing an ending, and structuring it in terms of beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12340">It’s tough, because you really don’t have too much material to work with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12341">Your characters are not defined, and there’s no room for specific detail. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12342">If you do put in too much detail, you may end up getting lost or confused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12343">It may take two or three times to write up your story line and edit it down to four pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12344">Your first effort may be eight pages long, which you’ll reduce to five, then finally cut to four.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12345">You might experience all kinds of internal resistance when writing the treatment; you might get angry or bored, and the chances are that you’ll probably make a lot of judgments and evaluations about what you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12346">Your critical voice may tell you “this is the most boring story in the world!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12347">Or “I hate it! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12348">It’s simple and stupid.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12349">Or “I’ve heard it all before.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12350">Or “Why did I think I could write this?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12351">You may be right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12352">At this stage, the chances are that your story may actually be boring.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12353">So what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12354">It’s only a four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12355">It’s only a first words-on-paper exercise, nothing more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12356">You can’t lose sight of the fact that you’re just writing four pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12357">It is what it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12358">These pages are not going to be carved in stone or written in gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12359">Just write the treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12360">It’s okay that it’s not perfect.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12361">Bear in mind that this four-page treatment may have little or nothing to do with the way your final screenplay turns out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12362">It’s only a start point, not the finished product. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12363">Your story is going to change and evolve and grow during the writing experience, so don’t expect these pages to be flawless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12364">Forget your expectations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12365">You don’t need to make too many critical evaluations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12366">Save them for later! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12367">Writing is experiential—the more you do, the easier it gets.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12368">One last note of caution: when you complete the treatment, the chances are that you’ll be uncertain about whether it works, or whether it’s good or bad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12369">Your tendency may be to get feedback, some kind of affirmation about what you’re writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12370">Don’t.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12371">Don’t let your wife, husband, lover, girlfriend, boyfriend, brother, or sister read it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12372">They’ll want to, I’m sure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12373">They may even beg and plead to read your four pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12374">Don’t let them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12375">And here’s why: I’ve had many students show these pages to the significant people in their lives looking for feedback and affirmation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12376">One woman, in particular, was insecure and showed her treatment to her husband, who happened to be in the movie business. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12377">Out of his love for her, out of his concern to “really be honest” with her, and because he cared so much, he told her what he truly thought about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12378">His “truth” was that the material was dull, the characters weren’t fleshed out, plus as an afterthought he mentioned that there might have been a similar film made several years earlier. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12379">Needless to say, she was devastated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12380">Not only did she put the treatment in a drawer and bury it, but what’s worse, she never went back to writing again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12381">She had a wonderful sense of comic potential but she chose to listen to her husband because she thought he knew more than she did, and she never recovered.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12382">I’ve seen this happen over and over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12383">It’s why you have to understand that this is only a four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12384">It’s not your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12385">It’s only a starting point exercise, not an end point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12386">Don’t write these four pages thinking you can sell it, either. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12387">This is an exercise to clarify your story in your own mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12388">Just do the exercise and tell the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12389">Don’t get caught up trying to sell the treatment or thinking about how much money you’re going to make when the movie is made.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12390">Focus on getting your story line down to four pages and don’t worry about what happens after it’s written.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12391">The way the ancient Sanskrit text, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12392">Bhagavad Gita</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12393">, puts it: “Don’t be attached to the fruits of your actions.”</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12444">Many years ago, while traveling with some friends in Italy, I went to visit the little town of Assisi, the home of St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12445">Francis of Assisi. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12446">We took a bus up the long and winding road to the little church and monastery high on the hill where St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12447">Francis lived, worked and studied. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12448">I didn’t know too much about him; I knew he started the Holy Order of the Franciscans and I knew he wrote sublime poetry, essays, and philosophy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12449">The paintings and images I had seen had always showed him being surrounded by birds and other animals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12450">It was said that he could talk to the animals, and his poetry and writings are filled with the harmony and union of nature and that all life is connected by divine consciousness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12451">All living things are related, he said, the birds, the trees, the rocks, the rivers, the streams and oceans, we are all manifestations of the one consciousness, and as living beings we express the life force that flows through us. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12452">Call it God, or Nature, or whatever you want, it doesn’t matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12453">It is what it is.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12454">As we toured the tiny, sparse rooms of the church and monastery and climbed the steep paths that wandered along the wooded hills, walking through shadows and sunlight, I noticed the birds were everywhere, chirping and singing in a cacophony of sound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12455">I stood observing this symphony of sound and movement, thought about walking on the same path as St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12456">Francis, and I became aware that my breathing had become calm and even, my mind still, and I felt like I was in a meditative state. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12457">I looked around the beautiful landscape and wondered whether I was experiencing this feeling because of the harmony of the landscape, or whether the land and trees and birds had absorbed St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12458">Francis’ state and I was just immersed in the energy or vibration of the place itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12459">I wondered whether this divine state, mind calm but senses totally alert, was the same state that St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12460">Francis referred to in his poetry and writings.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12461">I speculated as to whether we, as human beings, have this same potential to transcend our ordinary reality and enter this state of transcendence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12462">It was like I had merged into the environment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12463">I don’t know how long I stood on that footpath, absorbed in this energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12464">It could have been a few minutes or an hour. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12465">When I looked around, I saw a large number of birds resting on tree limbs nearby, and I knew deep down inside, they were watching me, like they were tuning into my thought waves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12466">It was an extraordinary experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12467">I roused myself and started down the path leading to the monastery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12468">As I made my way down the hill, I found myself wondering what kind of a person St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12469">Francis was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12470">Was he such a radiant and powerful being that he could transcend his identity as a man and merge into this living energy, or vibration, to became one with the spirit of the birds and animals of Assisi? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12471">What kind of a person was he that he could rise above his human limitations and become one with this divine energy? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12472">In other words, what qualities did St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12473">Francis possess that made him so unique as a person?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12474">And that brought up the question of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12475">It was a question I’ve asked myself many times, both as a teacher and a student, when writing and teaching about the qualities of character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12476">What makes good character?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12477">Is it the character’s purpose or motivation? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12478">Is it the dialogue that he or she speaks? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12479">Is it what the character wants to achieve during the course of the screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12480">Is it his insights or cleverness or credibility or believability? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12481">His integrity? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12482">Is it the action he goes through to achieve his dramatic purpose? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12483">What qualities must a character possess to keep us interested in him or her as he or she moves through the landscape of the screenplay?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12484">Philosophers talk about a man’s life as being measured by the sum total of his actions; our lives are “measured” by what we accomplish, or do not accomplish, in our lifetime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12485">“Life consists in action,” Aristotle said, “and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12486">What is character?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12882">The only major character who does not change is Conrad’s mother, played by Mary Tyler Moore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12883">Described in the opening stage directions as being “graceful and controlled,” she is like her refrigerator: “well stocked, and perfectly organized, with nothing out of place.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12884">She is the kind of person who believes that appearance is everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12885">Her house is immaculate, the closets are clean, and I’ll bet anything that if you open any drawer in the entire house everything is laid out meticulously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12886">That’s the kind of person she is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12887">She always seems to be firmly in control, unbending in attitudes and beliefs, convinced she is right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12888">By the end of the film, father and son have changed but she has not, and the family splinters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12889">In the last scene, father and son are sitting on the porch after the mother has left. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12890">Her leaving brings father and son closer together.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12891">See if you can have your character go through some kind of change, either emotional or physical, as it will broaden and deepen the character in terms of a universal recognition that transcends language, color, culture, or geographic location.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12892">If you know and can define these four elements of character—dramatic need, point of view, change, and attitude—you’ll have the tools to create good characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12893">Sometimes they will overlap, like an attitude emerging as a point of view, or the dramatic need will bring about change, and change will affect your character’s attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12894">If that happens, don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12895">Sometimes it’s necessary to take something apart in order to put it back together.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13309">One of the questions I continually get asked is, “How can I improve my dialogue?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13310">When I ask what’s wrong with it, the writer’s response is usually “it’s weak, stilted, awkward, phony, and all sounds the same.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13311">They might be right.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13312">People get hung up on dialogue because they don’t understand what it is, or what it does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13313">They put too much importance on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13314">They say good dialogue is “everything” in a script, and when they start writing and their dialogue doesn’t match their expectations, they become concerned, insecure, or sometimes angry and depressed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13315">Soon after, they’ll find themselves censoring their work, judging and evaluating it and becoming supercritical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13316">If they continue in this manner, they’ll probably stop writing altogether because they don’t feel their dialogue is good enough.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13317">So what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13318">Dialogue is experiential. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13319">The more you do the easier it gets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13320">When you sit down to write, you’ll probably end up writing 50 to 60 pages of shitty dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13321">Let it be terrible! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13322">It doesn’t matter at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13323">You’re going to rewrite it later, so let yourself be willing to write some awful dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13324">Most words-on-paper drafts will probably be this way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13325">Nobody can write perfect dialogue in the first words-on-paper draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13326">Writing good dialogue is a skill, like playing the piano, swimming, or riding a bike. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13327">The more you do it the easier it gets</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13328">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13329">Never mind how good or how bad it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13330">Trust the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13331">It’s larger than you are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13332">Let your characters speak for themselves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13333">Just keep writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13334">Be aware of any judgments or evaluations you’re making, and don’t let them influence you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13335">Easier said than done, of course. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13336">Just be willing to write some shitty dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13337">Don’t get locked into the trap of wanting to write perfect dialogue from page one, word one.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13338">What’s the purpose of dialogue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13339">It serves two functions: it either moves the story forward or it reveals character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13340">The next time you watch a film, preferably at home on a DVD where you can study the film, listen to the dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13341">Take a piece of paper and mark down what the dialogue accomplishes in each scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13342">If you want, you can literally chart each scene into some aspect of these two functions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13343">Try it and see if I’m right.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13344">Just know that if you’re willing to write 50 or 60 pages of terrible dialogue, most of the time it will clear up in the natural process of writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13345">You’ll find certain little phrases or expressions, particular cadences or rhythms of their dialogue that will tend to individualize your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13346">By the end of the first words-on-paper draft, you’ll be amazed at the change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13347">When you rewrite those pages, your dialogue will improve tremendously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13348">For some people, writing dialogue is a gift they’re born with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13349">But for most of us, it’s something we can develop.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13350">There are tools you can use to help you write more effective dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13351">One is using a cassette or digital recorder to record a conversation with a friend or acquaintance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13352">Play it back and listen to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13353">Notice how fragmented it is, how quickly thoughts come and go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13354">If you want to see what “real” dialogue looks like, type it up in screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13355">Listen for mannerisms and inflections; find the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13356">style</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13357"> of speech, the phrasing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13358">Then think about your character speaking in those “rhythms,” or in that “language.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13359">One of my students, a well-known journalist, was writing a screenplay she had been thinking about for years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13360">Her writing style was elegant and readable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13361">Her dialogue was beautiful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13362">That is, it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13363">read</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13364"> beautifully on the page—every sentence was clear and concise, every idea complete in thought and execution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13365">The language and punctuation were perfect.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13372">A screenplay is a reading experience before it becomes a visual one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13373">As mentioned, one of the main functions of dialogue is to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13374">In that regard, it must communicate necessary facts and information to the reader so he or she knows what is happening as the story line progresses.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13428">Another way to reveal character is to have other people shed light upon the character through dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13429">Henry James had a theory he called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13430">The Theory of Illumination</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13431">, where he put forth the idea that the main character of the story occupies the center of a circle, and on the periphery of the circle are all the other characters in the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13432">Each time a character interacts with the main character, he or she “illuminates” a different aspect of the main character, like walking into a darkened room and turning on floor lamps in each corner of the room. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13433">In the same way, dialogue illuminates and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13434">reveals</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13435"> something about the character.</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13536">When you’re writing the screenplay, the most essential aspect to keep in mind is that all drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13537">Many writers seem to forget that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13538">If the purpose of the scene in a screenplay is to either move the story forward, or reveal information about the character, the writer sometimes feels that telling the story means moving the character through the action like a chess piece without focusing on the conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13539">Why is conflict so important in writing the screenplay?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13540">Because it creates tension, rhythm, suspense, and keeps the readers, or viewers, on the edge of their collective seats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13541">A movie is larger than life, and if you want to write a script that brings a certain order to the world, you need to engage the reader. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13542">That means generating conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13543">The word </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13544">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13545"> means “in opposition to.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13546">In literary terms, it’s usually defined as “creating the force of opposition between the characters and the actions that helps shape or motivate the plot.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13547">If you have a character with a strong and defined dramatic need, then you can create obstacles to that need and the story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13548">If your character has a strong and distinct point of view, and you have another character with the opposite point of view, the result is a strong and continued conflict within the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13549">And that’s what it’s all about, sustaining conflict either in an emotional or physical context.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13553">The focus of the story is on three characters: Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter, is a man of many talents and few words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13554">Ada (Nicole Kidman), is a young woman raised to be a Southern “belle,” daughter of a Baptist Minister, who can read, write, play the piano, and be the perfect “hostess.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13555">Ruby (Renée Zellweger) is a feisty drifter who teaches Ada about strength and self-reliance and reveals a kind of world that Ada has never known or dreamed of. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13556">Three lives, uprooted by war, learn to depend upon each other to endure their physical and spiritual survival together.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13650">Remember, the purpose of the scene is to either move the story forward or reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13651">The dramatic core of achieving that is generating conflict—conflict within, or conflict without.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13652">Conflict can create dimensions that infuse the character and story line in a number of significant ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13653">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13654">Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13655">, Paul Thomas Anderson’s brilliant screenplay, the themes of reconciliation and forgiveness are woven throughout the story and reveal how the past actions of parents shape and influence the behavior of their children. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13656">Earl (Jason Robards) is dying of cancer and on his deathbed he seeks forgiveness for leaving his then fourteen-year-old son Frank (Tom Cruise) alone to care for his dying mother.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13657">This incident of Earl walking out on his dying wife has affected Frank’s life profoundly, leading him to develop a lifestyle where he channels his anger into convincing men to use sex as a weapon to “destroy the opposite sex.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13658">When Frank finally does confront Earl on his deathbed, Frank is able to complete his relationship with his dying father. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13659">This scene illustrates how certain facts uncovered within the character biography might help shape and form a character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13660">Through the character biography, you can </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13661">form</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13662"> your characters, then </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13663">reveal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13664"> them by showing who they are in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13665">Ibsen’s great play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13666">Ghosts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13667"> deals with some of these same themes, about the sins of the father being passed on to the son.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13668">One of the ways to accomplish this is by performing an exercise I call the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13669">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13670">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13671">It’s a process that allows you to uncover an incident in your character’s life that emotionally impacts your story line; typically, it’s an incident or event that occurs to your main character when he or she is between the ages of nine and eighteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13672">This is a very formative time, during which a traumatic event could possibly affect the entire course of a character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13673">This event might be the death of a parent or loved one, some sort of physical abuse that results in a deep emotional scar or physical injury, or a move to a new city or country.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13674">I call this event the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13675">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13676"> because if you picture your character as a circle, and then slice the events of his or her life like dividing a pie, you can evoke the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, social, mystical, political, traumatic, and intellectual incidents or events of their life that impact their behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13677">By doing this exercise, you can create a well-rounded portrait of your character that evokes the emotions, thoughts, and feelings that expand and deepen your characterization.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13689">“I’d rather be caught dead,” she states emphatically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13690">And, of course, it becomes a prophetic remark. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13691">From Oklahoma City, the only way to get to Mexico without going through Texas is the long way around, through Utah and Arizona. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13692">It is this decision that ultimately costs both women their lives, and at this point, they wouldn’t have it any other way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13693">This Circle of Being event, I feel, is triggered in the parking lot when Louise sees Harlan attempting to rape Thelma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13694">Louise totally loses it and pulls the trigger, killing Harlan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13695">To me, the Louise pulling the trigger in that parking lot is not the Louise of the present time; rather, it is the young girl who was raped in Texas many years earlier.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13696">Later, Hal, the police detective (Harvey Keitel), tells her on the phone, “I know what happened in Texas,” and a little later Thelma, referring to the rape attempt, guesses that “it happened to you, didn’t it?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13697">To the very end, Louise does not respond.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13698">Creating a Circle of Being event for your character is an invaluable tool to use in crafting and enriching your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13699">If you go into your character’s life and ask yourself what traumatic incident might have occurred in your character’s life between the ages of nine and eighteen, see what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13700">You might even explore your own life and see what, if any, traumatic event might have occurred in your life during this time frame.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13701">Why nine to eighteen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13702">First, because it seems to be the most formative period in a person’s life and results in specific behavioral patterns that remain either consciously or unconsciously in the psyche. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13703">The noted behaviorist Joseph Chilton Pierce states there are four major periods of growth, or spurts, of human intelligence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13704">The first intelligence growth period occurs when the child is about a year old, when they learn to walk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13705">The second intellectual spurt occurs when the child is about four years old and learns that he or she has a distinct identity and communication skills. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13706">The third stage of intellectual growth occurs when the child is about nine or ten; that’s the age when he understands that he has a singular and individual voice and begins to question authority, forming his or her own opinions about what’s right or wrong and starts speaking his mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13707">This is a vital time in the life of the young person.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13708">The fourth stage of human intelligence, and perhaps the most important developmental spurt according to Pierce, occurs when the person is about fifteen or sixteen—the teenager. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13709">That’s the age when the young person starts rebelling against authority and tries to find his or her own voice; she suddenly understands that her parents are no longer the center of the universe, and she looks outward, into the world for models of behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13710">The young person is heavily influenced by his peers, and may begin to dress differently, color his hair, get body piercings or tattoos, and experiment with drugs, actions which are more acceptable to his peers than to his parents or society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13711">But these actions express teenagers’ individuality and who they are within the context of their own peer group. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13712">They have an identity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13713">Just look at your own kids, or your nieces or nephews, or your friends’ kids, and how they dress, act, and react.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13714">It’s a period of a person’s development so influential that it can leave a subconscious imprint for the rest of his life, much like furniture leaves an impression in the rug. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13715">Take a moment and look back into your own life and see how influential this time was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13716">Just close your eyes and go back to the time when you were about that age, anywhere from nine to eighteen, or thereabouts, and see if there was any specific incident or event that affected you the most. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13717">What was the incident or event that springs to mind? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13718">Take a moment to consider how that event might have affected you and possibly changed your life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13719">If you go back into your character’s life and create an incident or event that becomes a major influence, then you can enhance the texture and depth of any character you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13720">By creating a Circle of Being event you can generate conflict or a plot complication that will expand the dimension of your character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13721">One of my students, a well-known and working playwright, wanted to make the switch from writing for the stage to writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13722">He had an interesting story that involved the reconciliation of two sisters after an absence of many years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13723">The story opens with the main character, a dentist, undergoing a dental procedure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13724">While under the influence of the anesthesia, she flashes back to a time when she was a young girl and witnessed her sister being raped by their uncle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13725">Fearful of being seen, she ran away and in her flight, tripped over a rock, fell, and injured her front teeth—the same teeth which are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13726">acting up now</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13727">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13728">She had totally repressed the memory of this event until now and it leads her to reconcile with her sister. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13729">This Circle of Being event sparked the entire story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13730">The themes of reconciliation and forgiveness thus became the narrative thrust of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13731">I suggested to the writer that we see the Circle of Being event as the story unfolds in visual bits and pieces scattered throughout the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13732">She recovers the incident in visual fragments, and the final script turned out to be very powerful material. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13733">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13734"> uses this same kind of visual technique throughout the narrative as we see fragments of Bourne’s memory as he tries to recall the murder of the politician Neski and his wife, in Berlin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13735">It adds tension and power to the film experience.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13808">It’s a small scene but quite an emotional moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13809">The impact on Red is enormous—it is what influences and shapes his life, a life built upon negative self-worth and deep-seated anger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13810">Emotionally, being given away by his parents has led him to believe that he’s not good enough as a person and we see that in his behavior as he lashes out at everyone he is close to.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13811">The Circle of Being event is the source of inner conflict that Red must confront and deal with for the rest of his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13812">He doesn’t feel he deserves anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13813">As the story progresses, we see his internal conflicts about his own self-respect and self-worth.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13814">I feel a Circle of Being event can also apply to animals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13815">As mentioned, I think Seabiscuit is a real character in this movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13816">He was given away at six months, just like Red Pollard, because he did not fit the image of what a racehorse should be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13817">He was taught to lose, not allowed to win a race. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13818">Is it any wonder that he “forgot what it’s like to be a horse”?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13819">Seabiscuit is affected by his real-life Circle of Being event. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13820">The narrator tells us that: “Seabiscuit was the son of Hard Tack, sired by the mighty horse Man O’ War….At six months he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons [who] decided the horse was lazy….Where his sire had been a fierce, almost violent competitor, Seabiscuit took to sleeping for huge chunks of the day and enjoyed lolling for hours under the boughs of the juniper trees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13821">So, they made him a training partner to ‘better’ horses, forcing him to lose head to head to boost the confidence of the other animal….When they finally did race him, he did just what they had trained him to do….He lost….And, of course, it all made sense….Champions were large. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13822">They were sleek. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13823">They were without imperfection. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13824">This horse ran as they had always expected him to run….”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13825">That is the power of the Circle of Being event in your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13826">It can be the source of conflict in the narrative line of action, whether animal or human. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13827">Film is a visual medium—a story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13828">As the ancient text of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13829">Yoga Vashista</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13830"> states, “The world is as you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13831">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13832"> it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13833">Your story is held together by its characters and conflict and becomes the arena where your character(s) confront the tremendous challenges of the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13834">Conflict and the Circle of Being are the key that ignites the engine and powers your character through the story line.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13870">In one scene, David is driving a rented convertible with the top down along one of those long country roads outside London that are lined with tall trees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13871">The girl, Maria Schneider, is in the passenger seat and she looks over at him and asks, “What are you running from?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13872">He replies by telling her to turn around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13873">She looks behind her and we watch from her point of view as the empty and barren road disappears behind them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13874">The moment holds as we see that he’s leaving his past behind, and moving into an unencumbered present, leading to an unknown and uncertain future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13875">It is cinema at its highest.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13876">When I grasped the realization of that moment, I found it affected me on a deep, and profound, emotional level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13877">No words, only pictures and the coursing recognition that we’re traveling on this road of life carrying our past behind like some unwanted luggage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13878">I’ve often wondered what it would be like if we could simply drop our past and step into the present moment free of time and memory.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13879">When I see a film I like, I respond immediately, on an emotional, intuitive level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13880">Either I like it or I don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13881">Either it works or it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13882">Oh yes, I can talk endlessly about the visual brilliance of the director, the great performances of the actors, the broad sweep of the photography, the poetry of the editing, or the ingeniousness of the special effects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13883">But when I get right down to it, there’s only one thing that holds the whole thing together—and that’s the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13884">Ideas, concepts, jargon, and analytical comments don’t really mean a thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13885">Whether the movie proceeds in a straight line, in a circle, or is fractured or splintered into little pieces, doesn’t make a bit of difference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13886">Movies are all about story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13887">No matter who we are, or where we live, or what generation we belong to, the singular aspects of storytelling remain the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13888">It’s been that way since Plato created stories out of the dancing shadows on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13889">The art of telling a story with pictures exists beyond time, culture, and language. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13890">Walk into the Elmira caves in Spain and look at the rock paintings, or into the Accademia Museum in Venice, and gaze upon those magnificent panels depicting the twelve Stations of the Cross, and you enter the grand view of visual storytelling.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13891">There are many filmmakers today who insist that the linear story line—where the story goes from beginning to end in a straight, narrative line—is passé, out of date, not “part of the scene” anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13892">They loudly proclaim that the three-act structure is dead, no longer pertinent to the “modern movie,” whatever that means. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13893">One filmmaker even went on record to state that “the Hollywood narrative film is in its death throes right now and people are looking for something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13894">The whole school of Act I/Act II/Act III is destructive to a thriving, growing cinema.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13970">This revolution/evolution in screenwriting seems to be based upon a new visual awareness of how we see the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13971">Today, the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking is an integral part of our culture and cannot be ignored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13972">Walk into any bookstore and you’ll see shelves and shelves devoted to all aspects of filmmaking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13973">Everybody, it seems, wants to be a filmmaker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13974">Write a script, get a digital video recorder, film the movie, upload it onto your computer, edit it with IPro Edit, or any of the other systems, add some special CGI effects, lay in a soundtrack from a database of music, and you have a film you can then email to your friends and family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13975">Many presentations, both in business and the arts, are now given visually, either on CD or DVD. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13976">With the dramatic rise of computer technology and computer graphic imagery, along with the expanded influence of MTV, reality TV, Xbox, PlayStation, new wireless LAN and Bluetooth technology, and the enormous increase in the number of film festivals both here and abroad, I think we’re in the middle of a cinematic revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13977">Already, we are making short episodic TV series for our cell phones to view during the day or project on TV. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13978">Clearly, we have evolved, and are evolving, in the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13979">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13980"> things.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13981">In terms of the screenplay, it seems we’re trying to get closer to the subjective reality of our characters in the same way that the great painters went from the objective world of landscapes and religious figures to the subjective world of the impressionists and abstract expressionism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13982">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13983">The Bourne Supremacy, Kill Bill: Vols. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13984">1 and 2, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Memento, Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13985"> (Patrick Sheane Duncan), the remake of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13986">The Manchurian Candidate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13987"> (Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris), and others.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13988">Why is this happening? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13989">I think part of it is due to the advancement of digital film technology, which has changed and influenced the way we see and interpret our experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13990">Most films coming out of Hollywood are as pretty as cotton candy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13991">They may look like they’re about something, but there’s nothing there but sugar and water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13992">There’s no content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13993">As Gertrude Stein once remarked about Oakland many years ago, “there ain’t no there when you get there.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14023">The drowning is seen in small fragments during the course of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14024">It is seen in the opening shots, a brief sliver of the event that haunts Conrad like a bad dream. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14025">He feels so guilty about his own survival that he cannot accept the fact that he is the one who lived. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14026">Before the story begins he had so little sense of self-worth that he tried to kill himself by slashing his wrists. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14027">We learn as Conrad learns about the hidden impact that seeps through his entire being and drives his sense of unworthiness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14028">The drowning, the key incident, is visually woven throughout the film and seems to anticipate the sheer power that time and memory plays upon the character of Jason Bourne in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14029">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14030">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14031">If there is any one film at this writing that seems to embody and capture this “new style” of screenwriting, it is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14032">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14033">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14034">Not only is it fast-paced and exciting, but the characters are well-drawn, the story powerful, and the action sequences, directed by Paul Greengrass, are visually stunning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14035">When I first saw it I was totally blown away; it touched me on both an emotional and physical level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14036">I walked out of the movie theater dazed by the visual brilliance and wondering how and why the film made such a powerful impression upon me.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14037">So I went back to see it a second time and marveled at the way screenwriter Tony Gilroy had integrated the portrait of a character who is basically reacting throughout the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14038">People are constantly trying to kill him, yet he still manages to capture the depth and essence of his character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14039">Not only that, but Gilroy inter-cuts strands of time and memory throughout the action in a stylized, “modern” approach to screenwriting.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14060">That was only one of the many questions I wanted to ask screenwriter Tony Gilroy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14061">Before talking to him, I went online and downloaded his filmography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14062">I saw he’d been writing for several years, with credits on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14063">Dolores Claiborne</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14064"> (adapted from the Stephen King novel), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14065">Extreme Measures</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14066">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14067">The Devil’s Advocate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14068">, and he also adapted </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14069">Armageddon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14070"> before he did </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14071">Bait</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14072"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14073">Proof of Life</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14074">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14075">That’s when he got the opportunity to write </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14076">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14077">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14078">I tracked him down in his office in New York where he was in the process of writing the third Jason Bourne film, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14079">The Bourne Ultimatum</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14080">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14081">He shared that at that particular moment, he was in a state of confusion, still thinking things through before the story took hold and got sorted out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14082">For me, that’s the most fun part—confusion is the first step toward clarity.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14083">I asked about his background. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14084">The son of writer-director Frank D. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14085">Gilroy, he grew up in upstate New York and originally started out as a musician. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14086">He played in a lot of bands, got involved in songwriting, and told me he “just got tired of playing music.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14087">He moved to New York and began writing short stories, moved on to writing a novel, and “fell in love with writing prose.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14088">When his brother, Dan, also a screenwriter, graduated from college, “he optioned a book that he was turning into a script and it looked like there was some interest in it,” Gilroy said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14089">“I had stopped playing music, and thought, well, I’m not going to finish this novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14090">I’m going to write a screenplay and make some dough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14091">Quick. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14092">Then I’ll go back and finish this book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14093">So I spent the next 5 years tending bar while I learned how to write a screenplay and fell in love with the form of it.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14094">“I learned a lot of things from music,” Gilroy continues. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14095">“I don’t read music, but making music in the recording studio and the process of recording music and rehearsing with bands and making arrangements of songs, basically just how you think about songs, seems to always be the same creative process.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14096">“How did you approach adapting </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14097">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14098">?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14099">I asked, because the political situations in the book were so different then and totally out of date now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14100">He paused for a moment, then replied that “I had to start with the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14101">If I were in that situation, what would I do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14102">I mean, if I had amnesia and woke up and didn’t know who I was, or didn’t remember where I was, and I’m in a place where no one knows me, and I don’t speak the language, I could probably figure out who I was by what I know how to do.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14103">“So,” he continues, “we discover what Jason discovers about himself at the same time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14104">When he comes to, his mind’s a blank—a clean slate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14105">He’s in an environment with no frame of reference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14106">So, you say to yourself, if this were me, what would I do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14107">How can I figure out who I am? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14108">The only answer seemed to be, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14109">what do I know how to do?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14110"> Do I know how to diaper a baby? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14111">Do I know how to fold laundry? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14112">Can I change a tire? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14113">What language do I speak? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14114">What happens if the things I discover I know how to do are repulsive? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14115">If that’s so, then that’s a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14116">That was my start point.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14117">We see this in the early part of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14118">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14119">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14120">Jason is sleeping on a park bench when he’s roughly asked for his papers by two policemen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14121">He tries to explain his situation, in German, and realizes he can speak the language. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14122">But the police are indifferent and sensing where the situation is going, Bourne doesn’t hesitate; he lashes out and quickly subdues the two cops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14123">How does he know how to do that?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14124">Action is character, right?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14125">Bourne gradually discovers he has a tremendous capability to defend himself, along with the ability to kill people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14126">He has knowledge of weaponry and fluency in several languages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14127">And he learns that people are out to kill him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14128">So he commandeers Marie (Franka Potente) and her car and they race toward safety, wherever that may be.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14129">When Gilroy approached </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14130">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14131">, he confronted a much more difficult problem: not only was the book out of date, but he had moved so far from the source material in the first film that it was impossible to bridge back to even the most basic plot elements. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14132">How did he go about building and constructing a new story line?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14133">Tony Gilroy approached this in two ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14134">At the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14135">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14136">, Jason tracks Marie down in Greece and the film ends with them together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14137">So, the first question Gilroy had to ask himself was, what happened to Bourne and Marie during the intervening years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14138">“Where would they have gone?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14139">he asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14140">“And what would be happening to them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14141">I thought the honeymoon would probably be over because he had escaped without really paying the emotional price of that relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14142">Being with Marie was easy so I felt there was a lot of unfinished psychological business with Jason Bourne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14143">I was sure the audience would want to know how much he was going to remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14144">And we had left that open. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14145">So I wanted to define for myself what might’ve happened to them on the run.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14146">“First, I wanted to find a location where they would go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14147">Bourne would be looking for a place that was ‘safe’—isolated, off the beaten track, but someplace where they might have a chance of blending in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14148">So I started looking for places which were out of the way, where people hadn’t shot too many movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14149">Finally, I found Goa, in India, and I thought that was really cool.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14150">“Once I had the location, then I could start sketching scenes for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14151">Long scenes, just getting them talking to see what might happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14152">They’d come together so quickly, and now their time together had been on the run, with Bourne constantly looking over his shoulder, I thought they’d probably be unhappy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14153">What would happen if the headaches had gotten worse? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14154">What happens if his paranoia has really started to wear on her? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14155">What would the reality be for a relationship like theirs?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14156">That’s all he had to start with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14157">Not much in terms of story except a character on the run who happens to have amnesia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14158">“So, what’s going to happen?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14159">Gilroy asks rhetorically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14160">“As far as the story goes, I’m back to square one: What kind of a movie is this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14161">Intuitively, I felt I didn’t want to drag Marie through this story line because I had already done that in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14162">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14163">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14164">I thought the best thing to do would be to kill her off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14165">That way there’d be no chance of repeating the first film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14166">“But how? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14167">And why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14168">I knew I needed something thematic, but since that wasn’t what was coming first I thought I’d follow this line and see where it led me and maybe I’d find something larger along the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14169">I wrote a scene where they had this huge fight—he thinks he’s seen someone following them, she’s had it with running away all the time and she doesn’t want to move again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14170">It’s Bourne’s paranoia that led to them moving like five or six times already. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14171">And now he wants to move again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14172">He’s on edge, jumpy, and feels he might be coming unhinged. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14173">So there’s this huge fight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14174">She storms out of the house, down the street, angry, not looking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14175">I had her get hit by a bus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14176">Which apparently in India is a fairly common occurrence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14177">She’s dead. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14178">Just like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14179">It was shocking and fresh and unexpected for this kind of movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14180">It was very energizing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14181">His reaction to her death—his complicity in it—seemed like an interesting place to start. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14182">But that’s all it was and I was still stuck on finding a big idea.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14183">How did he resolve this story issue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14184">I asked. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14185">He replied, “In the novel, which takes place in Communist China, there was a doppelganger [a double, or mirror image of someone] impersonating Jason Bourne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14186">I thought maybe I could use that—maybe someone </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14187">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14188"> impersonating him? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14189">But why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14190">And if I have them kill Marie and then have Bourne seeking to avenge her death, will this just become another revenge picture? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14191">If it is, what happens? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14192">I started wondering why someone would be impersonating him when he’s with Marie in Goa.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14193">“Around thirty pages in, I knew I needed another character, someone who’s after Bourne, so I created the Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14194">Why was she after him? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14195">That’s when I began to develop the theft in Berlin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14196">It was at that point that I got really bummed out because I realized it would have helped if the Chris Cooper character was still alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14197">But I had killed him off in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14198">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14199">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14200">If I knew then that we were going to do the sequel to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14201">Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14202">, I would have definitely kept Chris Cooper alive.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14206">Gilroy paused for a moment, then continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14207">“But, you know, I still felt I didn’t have any big theme. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14208">I couldn’t define what the movie was about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14209">Everything I had was jazzy, it was moving well, but I could see there was going to be a lot of trouble down the road. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14210">Everything was heading inevitably toward this being a very simple revenge picture. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14211">That’s when I knew I hadn’t really done the real work and it was going to come back and bite me in the ass. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14212">I knew we had to get on it right now.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14213">“So, I stopped writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14214">Just like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14215">I told everyone I really didn’t have it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14216">I wrote Matt Damon saying I didn’t think any of us wanted to just do a revenge movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14217">Because that’s the way we were going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14218">And it wasn’t going to work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14219">And I didn’t want to resurrect Marie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14220">There were some times where I thought maybe I shouldn’t have killed her, maybe I’ll bring her back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14221">But the more I thought about it, the more I knew it just wasn’t going to work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14222">“So I kept asking myself ‘what am I supposed to do with Jason Bourne?’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14223">You know, he has not paid the price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14224">He’s a guy with blood on his hands who’s made this sort of instant transformation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14225">It’s been too easy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14226">Can you really just wake up one morning and say, ‘Hey, I don’t remember who I am, but I’d like to start fresh thinking I’m a good person?’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14227">He didn’t confront the issue head-on in the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14228">Which is why he’s always looking over his shoulder, constantly feeling he has to be on the run. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14229">This is why he’s so screwed up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14230">Which is why he lost Marie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14231">He’s being revisited by all these sins because he’s never dealt with what’s really wrong with him—and there will never be any peace for him until he works this out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14232">“That’s when I realized that this movie could really be about an apology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14233">About atonement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14234">How can I find one specific thing he can atone for? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14235">Some kind of powerful incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14236">So I thought, well, who could he apologize to? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14237">That’s when I came up with the Neski assassination in Berlin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14238">He was assigned to kill the father but when the mother shows up unannounced he has to kill her as well, and then to cover his tracks he makes it look like the mother killed the father and then killed herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14239">And somewhere out there there’s this kid who is now parentless because of what Bourne did.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14240">I thought about this as I was studying the screenplay and I began to see that this thematic overview drives the entire narrative line of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14241">It is the foundation of the key incident (the killing of Neski in Berlin) that is now woven throughout the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14242">Once this key incident had been determined, it becomes the structural point to build and to anchor the rest of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14243">In the end, Bourne travels to Moscow to apologize to Neski’s daughter, thus atoning for his sins.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14244">At this point, Gilroy said, he had to make some distinctions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14245">First, the agents from Treadstone, the secret CIA assassination squad, were like “soldiers and their assignments were specific and precise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14246">That was the distinction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14247">The people that Treadstone killed were also ‘soldiers’ of some sort or another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14248">But Neski’s wife was collateral damage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14249">She wasn’t supposed to be there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14250">And Bourne’s improvised solution to this—the murder-suicide—added a whole other dimension to the tragedy of it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14251">Gilroy continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14252">“I’ve known a few people who are the children of suicide and it’s a shadow that follows them always. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14253">There were, no doubt, many people that Jason Bourne could find to apologize to, but this Neski construction came about because I needed the apology to have some possibility of hope to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14254">It needed to be more than just, ‘I’m sorry.’</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14255">“I wanted him to actually </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14256">give</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14257"> something, so it wasn’t just some selfish grab for atonement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14258">And Bourne knows that if he can find their daughter, he can at least make one thing better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14259">And when I understood that, I jumped to the end and sketched that final scene, which came very, very quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14260">It felt locked in—solid from the first pass. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14261">I knew I had the ultimate landmark to navigate the film toward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14262">And that’s when the whole movie opened up.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14263">I asked Gilroy how he structured the sequence in Berlin in terms of Bourne’s memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14264">I know that in my own life I’ve had similar experiences where something happened a long, long time ago and I had no recollection of the incident or, at best, only a vague, fleeting image of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14265">Then, one day, I would find myself in a certain, similar situation and suddenly remember a tiny piece of fragmented memory of what happened at that particular time or place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14266">Memory stirs something buried so deep that it can be stimulated either by a situation, a line of dialogue, or even the tea leaves left at the bottom of the cup, like Marcel Proust in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14267">Remembrance of Things Past</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14268">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14269">The killing of Neski and his wife is the foundation of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14270">It is this journey of discovery that literally holds the film together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14271">It is the source, the hub of the story line from which all things flow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14272">Once Gilroy figured this out, then he began to weave certain fragments of this key incident throughout the film to jog Bourne’s memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14273">That’s why the fragmented dream sequence that opens </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14274">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14275"> is so important to the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14276">It opens in a dream: inside a car; rain on the windshield, the sound of windshield wipers scraping across the windows, a misty yellow light from the hotel across the street, muffled sounds, fragmented images. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14277">We watch this unfolding in a dream with splintered, abrupt visuals, just out of the reach of consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14278">Bourne wakes with a start and tries to clear his head. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14279">Tries to remember and cannot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14280">Marie attempts to comfort him, but can’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14281">We’re in Goa, India. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14282">Then, we cut to Berlin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14283">Night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14284">A break-in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14285">We don’t know exactly what’s happening as we watch two men break into an office and plant plastic explosives in the basement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14286">The lights go out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14287">Shots are fired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14288">And at CIA headquarters in Langley, VA., under the command of Pamela Landy, there is chaos.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14289">We cut back to Goa. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14290">Marie takes the opportunity to leaf through Bourne’s journal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14291">It is a good way of showing us what little we know about Bourne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14292">Along with Bourne’s handwritten notations of streets, cities, various fragments, one entry stands out: “Who am I?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14293">Which is what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14294">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14295"> is all about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14296">Bourne finishes his run along the beach in Goa and we watch the arrival of the Russian, Kirill (Karl Urban), who is hunting Bourne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14297">And at the CIA, the names of Bourne and Treadstone have popped up and Pamela Landy is determined to find out what’s going on—after all, two of her agents have been killed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14298">Back in Goa, Kirill spots Bourne and a wild chase ensues resulting in the death of Marie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14299">That incident leads us to the Plot Point at the end of Act I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14300">Bourne is determined to find out what’s going on and who is responsible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14301">At this moment, it appears that this is going to be a revenge film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14302">Bourne buries the mementos of Marie and travels to Naples, determined to find out the who and why of what’s happening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14303">He is stopped, questioned, escapes, learns the identity of Treadstone, and, after the incident in Munich, travels to Berlin where he literally comes “face to face” with Pamela Landy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14304">That is the Mid-Point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14305">In the Second Half of Act II he discovers Abbott (Brian Cox) is responsible for planting Bourne’s fingerprints at the crime scene in Berlin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14306">After Abbott’s confession and suicide at the end of Act II, there’s only one thing left for Bourne to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14307">He takes responsibility for his actions and boards the train for Moscow seeking Neski’s daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14308">It is a time for redemption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14309">After an amazing car chase through the streets of Moscow, Bourne finally finds the young woman he has sought, asks her forgiveness, and walks away.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14310">That’s the structure of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14311">Lean, clean, and tight, with a thematic foundation that unifies the elements of time and memory within the context of a fast-paced action film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14312">It’s an extraordinary film, a great example of moving the screenwriting craft forward in terms of craft and evolution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14313">And what holds it together are two incidents: one, the inciting incident, the death of Marie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14314">The second is the key incident, Bourne discovering what happened in Berlin and his role in it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14315">What happened in Berlin is the underlying foundation of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14316">“Once I had that scene of what happened in Berlin, then I came to work every day ready to write,” Tony Gilroy says, and from there it was an issue of infusing time and memory into a story line with skill and visual acuity.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14317">“When I knew what that incident was, I was thinking very practically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14318">What kind of assassination is so special that Bourne would seek some kind of atonement? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14319">And what kind of assassination makes this one so special? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14320">Those were the questions I had to ask myself and I got the answers almost immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14321">It was Bourne’s first assassination and there was no record of it at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14322">No one knew anything about it except Abbott and the Chris Cooper character.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14606">It’s up to you to decide what you want to show, and only then can you figure out how to show it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14607">But for right now it’s important for you to define it and describe it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14608">How do you go about structuring Act I?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14609">First, we want to create the content in such a way that it can be anchored within the context of Act I, the Set-Up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14610">There are several ways to do this: sitting at the computer describing each scene in a few words, or outlining various scenes on a legal pad, or laying out a beat sheet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14611">What I caution against doing is simply creating a list of scenes they want to write in a numerical order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14612">It may work for some people but I try to keep the writing process as open in idea and content as possible, so for me, that doesn’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14613">It’s too limiting and there’s not much flexibility.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14614">I like to be flexible because I want to be able to change and manipulate the scenes I’m writing, especially in this part of the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14615">So I use cards to outline each scene, 3 × 5 cards to be specific, though any size will do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14616">Over the years I’ve learned that fourteen cards work best, and if you write one scene per card (though that’s a contradiction which will be explained later), you can lay out the content of Act I, from the opening scene or sequence to the plot point at the end of Act I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14617">People ask “why fourteen cards? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14618">Can’t I have twelve or sixteen or seventeen?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14619">My response is based on my own experience—when I look at the cards, I can tell whether there’s too much material for the Act, or whether there’s not enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14620">If a writer is laying out the structure of Act I and has only thirteen cards it’s typically not enough to set up the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14621">And, if you have fifteen cards it’s usually too much material for Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14622">Fourteen cards just work; it’s an effective tool for structuring Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14623">If you don’t believe me, try it and see what happens.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14624">Now you’re ready to lay out the structure of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14625">Remember that the first definition of structure is “to build something, or put something together.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14626">That’s what we’re doing now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14627">Take a handful of 3 × 5 cards and start writing out the scenes that you know you want in your story, one card per scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14628">It doesn’t have to be in chronological order, either. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14629">Where does your story open? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14630">With your character arriving at the employer’s trailer, like Ennis in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14631">Brokeback Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14632">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14633">Or does it open with a flashback like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14634">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14635">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14636">Suppose you want a continuous line of action—maybe you’ll have all three of your main characters waking up in the morning, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14637">The Hours</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14638">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14639">Or, maybe you’ll want to set up the character and situation like Alan Ball does in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14640">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14641">, with Lester’s voiceover saying: “My name is Lester Burnham, I’m forty-two years old and in a year I’ll be dead. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14642">Of course, I don’t know that yet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14643">This is the street where I live…” Maybe you want to open your script with your character at the office at the start of the day, or maybe you want to write an inciting incident (the incident that sets the story in motion; see Chapter 8 in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14644">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14645">) where you show a crime being committed, or a murder or break-in.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14646">Write the idea of the opening scene on a 3 × 5 card; not the entire scene, just a few words about the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14647">Free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14648">You should already know Card 1, the opening, and Card 14, Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14649">So you only need twelve more cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14650">Start throwing down ideas for the scenes you think should be in Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14651">Don’t think about it too much. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14652">Use only a few words per card, no more</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14653">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14654">So many times, I’ve had students write the entire scene on the front and back side of the card and when they start writing the screenplay they simply transpose the scene from the card to the scene on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14655">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14656">At this point in the process, you still want to remain open to receive any new thoughts or ideas that may spring into your awareness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14657">Otherwise you’re going to be too self-restricting and critical in the creative process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14658">Then write the next scene on another card, again using no more than a few words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14659">Then the next card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14660">And the next card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14661">Do it until you feel a sense of completion about the scenes and sequences you have on the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14662">For example, if your story is about an American journalist on assignment in Paris who falls in love with a young woman, has an intense and passionate affair, and then leaves for home, promising to return, your first card might read, “arrives in Paris.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14663">The second card,” checks into hotel; calls home”; third card, “meets assignment editor”; fourth card, “briefed on his subject and assignment”; fifth card, “sees subject at official reception”; sixth card, “arrives at the Ministry of Culture”; seventh card, “interviews subject”; eighth card: “sees a person he is attracted to”; and so on, scene by scene, card by card, leading to the plot point at the end of Act I (card 14) when he “meets the young woman” he will fall in love with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14664">If you are in doubt about whether to write down a scene on a card, do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14665">When in doubt, write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14666">When you’ve finished, you may have ten, or twelve, or fourteen, or eighteen cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14667">However many cards you have on this first go-around, you’ll want to go through them until you end up with fourteen cards.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14668">Next, lay out the cards one by one, from the first scene to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14669">Free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14670">What happens? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14671">What happens next? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14672">What happens then? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14673">These are magic words as they will spur new thoughts and ideas into the creative process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14674">If need be, you may want to add a word or two of dialogue on some of the cards to help smooth out the flow of the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14675">Your main character should be in most of the scenes on the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14676">Don’t get </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14677">too</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14678"> specific; it’s better to be vague and general at this point as you lay out the action in broad strokes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14679">You can do it all in fourteen cards.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14753">The conversation that took place before the story began is the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14754">The back story can be anything, as long as there’s some kind of emotional or dramatic aspect to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14755">A back story, for example, is not preparing for a date and the car won’t start and you can’t reach the person who’s expecting you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14756">It’s not about your character going to the market shopping for groceries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14757">I’m talking about the kind of incident, episode, or event that impacts your character so he or she enters that first scene or sequence with some kind of emotional or dramatic burden.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14758">Here’s an example of a back story taken from my own life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14759">Several years ago, I had a wonderful cat named Rosie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14760">She was then about seventeen years old and was beginning to have some serious health problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14761">One night, I had a very important dinner meeting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14762">I had been looking forward to it for some time and there was a lot riding on the project for me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14763">The producer, director, two story executives, and I were going to meet at an exclusive restaurant in Santa Monica. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14764">As I was getting ready for the meeting, I heard a strange sound and noticed Rosie having a difficult time breathing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14765">I knew immediately she needed emergency treatment.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14766">I finished dressing as fast as I could, grabbed Rosie, and rushed her to the emergency hospital on the way to the restaurant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14767">I called the restaurant and told them I would be detained for a while. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14768">When Rosie’s exam was finished, the vet told me she was in serious condition and I needed to leave her there for a twenty-four-hour medical observation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14769">I walked out of the vet’s with more than a little trepidation as I rushed to the meeting in Santa Monica. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14770">Now, what do you suppose I was thinking about through most of the meeting?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14771">That’s the power and effect of the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14772">If you have a strong back story for your character, you can start your screenplay at the very beginning, page one word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14773">The back story allows you to jump into the story line from the very first words on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14774">So, to write an effective back story, ask yourself some basic questions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14775">What happens to your main character a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14776">Can you describe it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14777">Articulate it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14778">How does it affect your character, either emotionally or physically, in the first scene?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14779">An effective back story can influence the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14780">Look at the opening sequence of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14781">The Shawshank Redemption:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14782"> Andy Dufresne is sitting in a car drinking, pulls out a gun, tries to load it as he slugs down a bottle of whiskey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14783">He gets out of the car, then staggers toward the house, gun in hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14784">What do you think the back story would be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14785">Probably when he found out his wife was having an affair with a tennis pro. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14786">It’s an event that impacts the main character and sets up the inciting incident that opens the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14787">He intends to kill his wife and her lover and it is this scene that sets the story in motion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14788">In a screenplay, you’ve got to grab the reader immediately, from page one, word one, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14789">The Royal Tenenbaums, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14790">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14791">Body Heat</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14792">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14793">You don’t have time to find out what that first scene is about; you’ve got to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14794">know</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14795"> what it’s about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14796">Because if you don’t know, who does?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14797">The back story helps you jump into your script from the Fade In. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14798">It generates a strong sense of dramatic or comedic tension immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14799">So what happens to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14800">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14801"> character, a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14802">What incident, episode, or event is working on your character when the story begins?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14803">Suppose your script opens with your main character arriving at work on Monday morning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14804">The back story might be that on Friday afternoon your character went to his or her boss and asked for a raise and the boss said no.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14805">Your character goes home and suffers through a long weekend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14806">You can imagine what your character is thinking or feeling before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14807">Then you open your script on a Monday morning as your character arrives at work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14808">Imagine her getting off the elevator: Is she grim and tight-lipped, or jocular and carefree? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14809">Or is she wearing a cool and personable demeanor, showing her associates at work that everything is okay, but it’s only a mask because underneath that façade are the seeds of anger, resentment, and low self-worth bubbling up to the surface. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14810">And somewhere along the line they’re going to erupt.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14811">That’s the force of a good back story; it allows you to enter the action from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14812">This way, you know the purpose of the opening scene so you don’t have to go “searching” for it, trying to figure out what’s going to happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14813">That opening scene or sequence always seems to be the most difficult to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14814">Knowing your back story can help you achieve the maximum dramatic value from the very first page of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14815">One of my students was writing a story about a stage director preparing her first theatrical production off-Broadway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14816">My student was having difficulty defining the emotional state of her main character and didn’t know where or how to open her story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14817">Should she open at a rehearsal or opening night? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14818">Every time she sketched the opening, it was wordy, expository, filled with unnecessary dialogue and meaningless conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14819">She didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14820">I told her to write up a back story and include something in the main character’s marriage that might influence the action of the play within the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14821">When I asked her what the story of the play her character was directing was about, she didn’t know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14822">Well, I said, if she didn’t know, who did?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14823">So she went home and wrote up a character essay about the relationship of the main character to her husband—where they met, how long they’d been married, and the emotional forces that might be working on the main character when the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14824">Then she wrote up a back story, which literally opened up the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14825">What she “found” in her back story was this: the marriage was in trouble and the main character’s husband wanted to start a family, but she wasn’t ready for that step. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14826">Her career was just getting off the ground and she was afraid she would lose this opportunity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14827">When the chance came for her to direct the off-Broadway play, she jumped at it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14828">Her husband became jealous and resentful, and the gap between the main character and husband grew wider.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14829">The back story takes place about a week before the play’s opening (the opening night was Plot Point I) and she knows it’s just not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14830">Tense and frustrated, the director gets into “another argument” with her husband about starting a family just before the final week of rehearsals begin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14831">Angry and upset, she storms out of the apartment and jumps onto the subway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14832">As she makes her way uptown, she gets an insight into why the play isn’t working and understands what she has to do to fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14833">She races to the theater to meet the actors in rehearsal.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14834">That was the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14835">Now, my student opened her screenplay with the main character getting off the subway and rushing to the rehearsal with a newfound awareness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14836">The back story allowed her to open her screenplay with strong dramatic tension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14837">She was able to “leap” into her story line from the opening shot and didn’t have to search for her story in the first few scenes of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14838">She went from not knowing how the story opened to knowing exactly what she had to do to open it dramatically, effectively, and visually.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14839">If your screenplay has a “play within a play,” like a radio show, a soap opera, a play, or a movie, you must be able to describe its premise in a few sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14840">That way, you can structure a progression of the story within the story to emotionally influence the main character’s dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14841">This is especially true if you’re writing a nonlinear screenplay like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14842">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14843"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14844">The Hours</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14845">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14846">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14847">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14848">, you have two stories moving the story forward: the one in the past, the love story between Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas), and the one in the present, when Almásy is wounded and swathed in bandages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14849">Both stories are structured linearly, from beginning to end, with parts of each interwoven into a continuous narrative line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14850">That’s how the back story can help you design the first scene or sequence so you begin your screenplay from page one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14851">What happens to your main character a day, a week, or an hour before your story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14852">Remember, you’ve only got about ten pages to grab your reader.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14853">Sometimes you’ll discover that you like the back story so much that you want to open your screenplay with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14854">That’s fine, but if you do this you still need to write another back story to lead into your new opening scene with a sense of strong dramatic tension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14855">And there are times when the writer writes one back story, likes it, then writes another one, likes that one, then writes another back story, and soon the original opening of the script becomes the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14856">If that happens, just go with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14857">Structure is flexible, it’s like a tree in the wind that bends but does not break.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14858">So, if that happens and you decide to open your screenplay with what was once one or several back stories, just write up another back story so you’ll always know where your character is coming from. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14859">Actors do this all the time; before an actor enters a scene he has to know were he’s coming from, what the purpose of the scene is, and where they’re going when the scene is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14860">That’s just good preparation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14861">Do the same with the back story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14862">Sometimes the back story will become part of the screenplay, sometimes not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14863">It depends on the individual script.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14865">Act I is a unit of dramatic action between twenty and thirty pages long that is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14866">Remember, you are setting up your story, your characters, and the relationship between the characters.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14867">Then structure the action of Act I on fourteen 3 × 5 cards.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14868">You already know the opening scene or sequence and the Plot Point at the end of Act I, so you know card number one and card fourteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14869">Start at the beginning of your story and move through the action leading to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14870">Free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14871">You know where you’re going, so all you have to do is get there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14872">Lay the story line out on cards, one scene or sequence per card, using no more than a few words on each card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14873">When you’ve completed the cards, read them over and over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14874">Don’t change anything until you feel the “urge” to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14875">Then, if you like, change a word here or there, just to make the cards read smoothly and simply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14876">Describe the story line in broad and general strokes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14877">After you’ve done the cards, write up the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14878">Remember, it will influence the action of the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14879">Look at your opening scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14880">Where does it take place? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14881">Describe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14882">Define it.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14885">Just free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14886">Lay it out, regardless of grammar or punctuation or any plot holes you may have. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14887">You might also need to lay out the back story in terms of beginning, middle, and end, or even have to write up a character essay in order to feel comfortable about the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14888">Do whatever needs to be done, because if you don’t know the story, who does? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14889">The back story can usually be written in a couple of pages, but if you need more, use them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14890">It doesn’t matter how long or how short it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14891">The back story is a tool in the screenwriting process, one of the many that lead to a dynamic and forceful opening.</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14899">During the two years or so that I headed the story department at Cinemobile Systems, I read more than two thousand screenplays and almost a hundred novels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14900">I read so much I couldn’t see straight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14901">There was always a large pile of scripts on my desk and no matter how fast I read I was always seventy scripts behind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14902">Every time I thought I was caught up, my boss would walk in and tell me a new batch of submissions was coming in and that I “better hurry” if I didn’t want to fall too far behind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14903">That meant I could expect about a hundred screenplays to arrive in the next few days.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14904">I looked for any excuse to avoid reading a script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14905">If a script came in with a one-page synopsis, I read the synopsis only. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14906">If the writer told me the story when he or she submitted the script, then I read the first few pages, a page or two in the middle, and the last three. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14907">If I liked the story line, or the situation, and the way it was written, I read the whole thing; if I didn’t, I tossed it in the return file—in this case the trash can. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14908">If I had too much to eat for lunch, or if I had too much to drink, I would lean back in my chair, read the first few pages, prop it on my lap, turn off the phones, and take a ten- or fifteen-minute nap.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14909">My job, as I was constantly reminded, was “to find material.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14910">And yet most of the scripts I read were not very good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14911">Either they were derivative of other movies, or old TV series, or the initial idea was simply a one-liner, meaning the entire screenplay was only about one thing—similar to the later </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14912">Analyze This</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14913"> (Peter Tolan, Harold Ramis, and Kenneth Lonergan), which is only about what happens in the psychiatrist’s office and the character’s reaction to that, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14914">Four Weddings and a Funeral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14915"> (Richard Curtis), which is merely a cute and clever boy-meets-girl story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14916">More often than not, the scripts were thin, flimsy, and weak and I had seen it all before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14917">That was the “good stuff”; the rest of the material was just poorly written.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14918">I began to see what Jean Renoir had pointed out to me so many times before: writing for the screen is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14919">To write a good screenplay, you have to tell the story in pictures, not words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14920">As I was learning, the art of screenwriting is in finding places where silence works better than words.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14921">Of the more than two thousand screenplays I read, I found only forty worth submitting to our financial partners for possible production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14922">Why so few? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14923">As a writer taking a much-needed break from screenwriting, I was curious as to what made these screenplays better than all the others I had read.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14924">Over the next few years, I watched as studios and producers picked up many of the scripts I had found and made them into movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14925">Of those forty scripts I had selected, some thirty-seven films eventually were made, including classics like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14926">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14927"> (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14928">American Graffiti</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14929"> (George Lucas), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14930">Jeremiah Johnson</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14931"> (John Milius, Edward Anhalt, and David Rayfiel), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14932">Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14933"> (Robert Getchell), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14934">The Wind and the Lion</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14935"> (John Milius), and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14936">Taxi Driver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14937"> (Paul Schrader), along with many others.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14938">What made these forty screenplays better than the other one thousand nine hundred sixty I had read? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14939">I began studying these scripts, and soon began to enlarge my own understanding about the nature and craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14940">After a while, I began to separate certain styles into specific genres: action-adventure, romantic comedy, science fiction, drama, mystery, and detective stories, and I began to explore how they were put together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14941">I started understanding the dynamics of the sequence, a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14942">While I was still in this observational mode, I was given the opportunity to teach a screenwriting course at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14943">I had never taught any kind of a class before and the memories I had of my own teachers were not very flattering. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14944">The only effective models I had as teachers were Jean Renoir and one of my English professors at Berkeley during the ’60’s—they were teachers who sparked my desire to learn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14945">And I remembered something Renoir had once said, that a good teacher is someone who teaches the student to see the relationship between things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14946">Could I do that? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14947">Did I want to do that? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14948">And the bigger question: What would I teach and how would I go about doing it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14949">The only thing I could do, I realized, was to go into my own writing and reading experience and share my observations about the craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14950">What did I look for as a reader? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14951">First, I noticed the style of writing—whether it was active, written in present tense, with terse, visual descriptions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14952">The style had to be established from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14953">For example, here’s a brief description of a run-down building that is a good illustration of a strong, active, visual style: “Bright sun beating through holes in a rusted tin roof. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14954">The dirt floor has been dug up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14955">A deep hole, lined with plastic sheeting has been unearthed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14956">There’s a FOOTLOCKER open to one side.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14957">That kind of visual description grabs my attention immediately.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14958">The next thing I learned is that as a reader, I have to know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14959">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14960"> the story is about in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14961">What is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14962">dramatic premise?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14963"> It could be as simple as the phony Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14964">Mulwray’s line in the first few pages of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14965">Chinatown:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14966"> “My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14967">The answer to that question, of course, results in the uncovering of a huge water scandal and several murders.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14968">I also needed to know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14969">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14970"> the story is about. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14971">Who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14972"> is the main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14973">Then I can determine whether the action and characters have been “set up” within the first few pages and a strong dramatic context established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14974">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14975">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14976">, Jake Gittes is clearly the man in charge.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14977">The third thing that has to be established is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14978">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14979">, the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14980">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14981">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14982">, the dramatic situation is shown and talked about within the first ten pages: Los Angeles is in the middle of a severe drought and water has become a scarce commodity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14983">Jake Gittes is a private investigator hired by the wife of a prominent man suspected of having an affair, and her husband is the head of the Water and Power Department of Los Angeles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14984">All three things: main character, dramatic premise, and dramatic situation are related and set up the story within these first ten pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14985">It wasn’t too long before I discovered that I could tell whether or not a script was working within the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14986">If I didn’t know what was going on during that unit of action, I found my interest wandering and I began to look for ways to stop reading.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14987">You’ve only got about ten pages to grab the attention of your reader or audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14988">It is the screenwriter’s responsibility to set up the first ten pages of the screenplay so the essential story information is established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14989">These first ten pages need to be designed with skill, economy, and imagination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14990">You don’t have time to wander around searching for your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14991">If you haven’t involved your readers within the first ten pages, you’ve lost them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14992">You must set up and establish three major elements in those first ten pages:</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15043">If need be, take that first scene or sequence and structure it into individual and distinct parts: the beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15044">How? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15045">Start with a separate sheet of paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15046">Then, take the general line of action, like a chase or wedding sequence or just getting out of bed in the morning, and list the activities that happen at the very beginning of the scene or sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15047">Remember that scenes are made up of shots and connected by two things: place and time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15048">If you change either, you need a new scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15049">(If need be, see Chapters 10 and 11 in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15050">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15051">.)</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15052">Do the same with the middle of the scene, and the end—just list the number of activities that occur during the scene or sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15053">For example, if the first scene takes place in an office, the beginning might show your character preparing for the meeting or putting together the presentation that occurs in the office. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15054">He or she might be working with an associate as they go through the material for the presentation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15055">Or, you might show the character at home after an argument with a friend, lover, or spouse, going through the material before he or she leaves for work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15056">Maybe your character is catching a flight later in the day on a business trip and we meet him as he’s packing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15057">Maybe he has a family and we see him getting ready for his day, like the opening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15058">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15059">, or waking up on a morning that may have a significant impact on his life, like getting the lab results regarding a serious illness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15060">The way to approach the scene is to define your character’s dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15061">Is this a scene that is going to move the story forward or reveal aspects of the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15062">What is the purpose of the scene in relation to the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15063">Remember that we’re striving for conflict, either internal, external, or some combination of the two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15064">What is your character doing before the scene begins and what does he do or where does he go after the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15065">What happens at the beginning and end of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15066">At this point you might want to sketch in some visual aspects and details you could use in the scene.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15152">There’s a good screenwriting tool that may help guide you when you’re writing the scene: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15153">entering late and getting out early</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15154">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15155">William Goldman, the brilliant screenwriter of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15156">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Princess Bride</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15157">, and numerous others, tells a story about where and when to enter a scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15158">Goldman sets up a hypothetical situation: a reporter is interviewing a subject for a newspaper or magazine article. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15159">The beginning shows the reporter preparing for the interview and arriving at the location; the middle has him greeting the subject, getting comfortable, taking out his or her tape recorder, and beginning the interview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15160">The ending is concluding the interview, packing up, thanking the subject, putting on his or her coat, walking to the door, then suddenly remembering something, turning around and saying: “Oh, by the way—one last question.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15161">That’s the beginning, middle, and end of this hypothetical scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15162">Where does the screenwriter enter the scene, Goldman asks? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15163">With the reporter arriving? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15164">Greeting the subject? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15165">The interview in progress? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15166">The answer is none of the above. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15167">The best place to enter the scene, Goldman says, is at the last possible moment, just before the reveal with the reporter asking: “Oh, one last question.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15168">That would be the best place to enter the scene because you can omit all the unnecessary stuff that happens before and focus on what has to be revealed in the scene. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15169">Enter late and get out early</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15170">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15171">There’s a great little scene from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15172">Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15173"> where Claudia (Melora Walters) is sitting in a bar and a guy comes up to her and says “Hey.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15174">She says “hi.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15175">And we cut to Claudia’s place as they “stumble into the apartment,” do a few lines of coke, and he looks at her and says “So?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15176">and we cut to them having sex.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15177">It’s great screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15178">The audience can fill in the blanks; we know what’s happening and don’t need it explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15179">It’s a very good example of entering late and getting out early with a beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15196">These are all creative decisions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15197">You want to choose the most exciting part of the scene or sequence and use that as your starting point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15198">You have to grab your reader’s attention. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15199">Do you see the first scene done in close shots or in a master shot of the entire location, like a restaurant or living room? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15200">Your intention is to create the best visual impression to make the scene or sequence work most effectively, with maximum dramatic value.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15201">It is essential to set up your story line immediately, from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15202">You have ten pages to grab the attention of your reader or audience, so you’d better design them carefully, with skill and precision.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15203">The opening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15204">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15205"> (Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens), is a good example; the first few pages set up the history of the Ring; we see it forged in the fires of Mount Doom, see the struggle of good and evil played out, then learn that it must be destroyed at its place of creation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15206">Once this is established, we cut to Gandalf arriving at Middle-Earth and the story begins to unfold.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15207">The script opens with an action sequence which is the inciting incident, and hear a voiceover narration spoken by Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) wherein we introduce the history of the Ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15208">“It began with the forging of the Great Rings….Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest—fairest of all beings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15209">Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15210">And Nine…nine rings were gifted to the race of Men who, above all else, desire power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15211">For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15212">But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made….In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others….And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15213">One Ring to rule them all…”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15214">During this opening battle for the Ring, the inciting incident occurs: the Ring is lost, then found on page 5, “by the most unlikely creature imaginable…A Hobbit—Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15215">We meet the creature, Gollum, anguishing over the loss of his “precious” and we learn on page 6 that “the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15216">In the next scene, we enter the Shire as Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives and is greeted by Frodo (Elijah Wood). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15217">He then visits Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), and on page 10, Bilbo tells Gandalf how weary he is: “I feel it in my heart,” Bilbo says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15218">“I need a holiday—a very long holiday and I don’t expect I shall return—in fact, I mean not to.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15219">Look at what we’ve learned in these first ten pages: we’ve established the history of the Ring, introduced Gollum, showed how Bilbo found the Ring, met two of the main characters (Gandalf and Frodo), and been introduced to life in the Shire as Bilbo reveals the Ring to Gandalf and tells him of his intention to disappear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15220">We’ve set up everything we need to know to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15221">It is lean, clean, and tight, visually designed to grab the attention of the reader and audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15222">And it works marvelously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15223">This entire unit of action, the first ten pages, is what sets up all three episodes of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15224">The Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15225">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15226">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15227">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15228">, we meet Jane (Thora Birch) and Ricky (Wes Bentley) as Jane provocatively asks Ricky if he’ll kill her father. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15229">Then we cut into a high overhead establishing shot of the street, ending at the house where Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and his family live. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15230">We see the house and hear Lester speaking in voiceover: “My name is Lester Burnham, I’m forty-two years old and in a year I’ll be dead. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15231">Of course, I don’t know that yet.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15232">We’re introduced to Lester’s wife, his daughter, and his neighbors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15233">In a few simple strokes we know who the main character is and what the story is about—Lester regaining his “life”—and we are prepared for the key incident, when he meets Angela (Mena Suvari) at Plot Point I, where the true story begins.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15234">Another good example of an opening scene is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15235">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15236">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15237">We are on the deck of an aircraft carrier, and watch as military jet planes take off, then cut to newsreel footage of Russian rebels taking over the Kremlin and threatening a nuclear strike on the United States. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15238">Then we pull back from a television screen into a birthday party for Lt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15239">Commander Ron Hunter’s (Denzel Washington) four-year-old daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15240">It is a scene that exploits the situation and reveals character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15241">It’s a very visual sequence, and a great example of an inciting incident.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15242">Whether you’re writing a comedy or drama or thriller or love story makes no difference at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15243">The form remains constant. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15244">Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15245"> opens up with a monologue by Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) telling us that he and Annie (Diane Keaton) have ended their relationship and how he “keeps sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15246">That, really, is the whole film, since those “pieces of the relationship” are then told in flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15247">It’s all set up on the first page of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15248">Larry Kasdan’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15249">Body Heat</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15250">, also a classic </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15251">film noir</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15252">, is another good example of setting up the story within the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15253">The film opens with Ned Racine (William Hurt) looking out the window at a distant fire while his one-night stand gets dressed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15254">Racine says that it was “probably one of my clients” who started the fire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15255">On page 3, he is in court and we learn that he is a lazy, “incompetent” attorney. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15256">The judge is irritated and tells him “the next time you come into my courtroom I hope you’ve got either a better defense or a better class of client.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15257">On page 4, he is having lunch with his friend Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and we learn that Racine is a man who’s “searching for a quick score.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15258">It tells us a lot about him.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15259">On page 6, we see him in his law office with an elderly client; Racine had sent her to a doctor who will not testify on her behalf, so he tells her he will find a “more understanding” doctor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15260">“We’ll sue those reckless bastards dry,” he adds.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15261">Later, on page 7, it’s night and he’s bored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15262">He has a drink at the bar, then wanders over to the beachfront bandstand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15263">He listens to the music, sees Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), “this extraordinary, beautiful woman,” walking toward him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15264">“She passes within a few inches of him….Racine’s body sways a moment as she goes by as though buffeted by some force.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15265">He follows her, and during their conversation she tells him she is a married woman; he replies that she should have said, “I’m a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15266">happily</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15267"> married woman.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15268">She sizes him up and says, “You’re not too smart, are you?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15269">Then, as an afterthought, “I like that in a man.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15270">He remarks that she looks “well tended,” then adds, “I need tending, but only for the night.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15271">Racine’s the type of person, we learn, “whose dick gets him into trouble.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15272">When Matty spills a cherry Sno-Kone on her blouse, he gets some paper towels, but when he returns she’s gone, vanished into the night.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15273">These pages are very good illustrations of a well-designed opening.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15274">You can see how important the first ten pages of the screenplay are in terms of setting up the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15275">They need to be conceived, designed, and executed for maximum dramatic value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15276">If you set these pages up correctly, the story can unfold properly, with simplicity, insight, and understanding.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15281">Look at some films to help illustrate some effective first ten pages, such as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15282">Collateral, American Beauty, The Lord of the Rings, Citizen Kane, All About Eve, Chinatown, The Bourne Supremacy, The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15283">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15284">Basic Instinct</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15285">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15286">You can obtain a copy of the some of these scripts online at Web sites like: </span><i class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4" href="http://simplyscripts.com"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15287">simplyscripts.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15288"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4" href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15289">Drew’s-Script-O-Rama.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15290"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><a class="calibre4" href="http://dailyscript.com"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15291">dailyscript.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15292">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15293">Or you can just Google “screenplays” and see what comes up.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15294">The first ten pages are probably the most difficult you’ll write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15295">After all, you’re putting your first words down on paper, you haven’t found your own style yet, so you may experience some doubt, confusion, and uncertainty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15296">Never mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15297">Just sit down and do it, and be willing to write some terrible pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15298">Don’t think about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15299">Do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15300">Jump in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15301">Trust the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15302">No matter what the results, good or bad, “true art,” as Jean Renoir once told me, “is in the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15303">doing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15304"> of it.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15305">The very worst that can happen is that you write some terrible pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15306">So what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15307">If they’re that bad, just throw them away! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15308">You’re not obligated to show them to anyone.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15309">If you ask yourself how good or bad your first few pages are, you don’t have to guess what the answer is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15310">Obviously, it’s going to be bad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15311">You will know that it’s boring, dull, trite, and ordinary, and you’ve seen it all before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15312">That may be an accurate judgment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15313">It may well be true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15314">But who is it that’s making that judgment? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15315">You are.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15316">Let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15317">It’s only a judgment; it doesn’t mean anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15318">“The mind,” the great Master Swami Muktananda said, “is a strange and funny thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15319">In the summer it longs for winter, and in the winter it longs for summer.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15320">But judgments are part of the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15321">Expect it, but don’t let it interfere with the experience of writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15322">Screenplay form should never get in the way of your screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15323">It’s so simple it’s difficult.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15324">Screenwriting software like Final Draft will do the formatting for you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15325">A good exercise might be to type up ten pages of a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15326">Take any screenplay, open it at random, and simply type ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15327">Just copy everything on the page and familiarize yourself with the form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15328">If you don’t have access to any screenplays, go online and download a screenplay that you like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15329">There are many Web sites available, so just copy these 10 pages, word for word, shot by shot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15330">You may find it an effective way to help nudge you into the screenwriting process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15331">When you start writing, just lay your story line out scene by scene, shot by shot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15332">You may find it easier to write everything in master shots: INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15333">RESTAURANT or EXT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15334">PARKING LOT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15335">Be willing to make some mistakes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15336">You’re not going to write perfectly from page 1.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15337">Just </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15338">tell your story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15339">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15340">When I was working with Jean Renoir, he remarked that beginning a new creative project, whether it be a painting, symphony, or novel, is very much like going into a clothing store and trying on a new jacket. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15341">When you try it on the first time, it doesn’t look right or feel right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15342">You take it in here, let it out there, alter it so it fits. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15343">When you try it on again, it looks all right, but it still feels a little tight under the arms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15344">You shrug your shoulders to loosen it up a bit and make it a little more comfortable, “but you have to wear it awhile before you get used to it,” Renoir said.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15345">It’s the same principle when you’re writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15346">You’ve got to get used to it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15347">Be willing to try things that may not work, to write awkward, stilted, or boring dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15348">It doesn’t matter at this stage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15349">Sit down and write the first ten pages of your screenplay, focusing on your main character, the dramatic premise, and the dramatic situation.</span></p>

<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15359">When I first started teaching my screenwriting workshops, my students worked very hard designing and executing the first ten pages of their scripts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15360">But when they moved into the second ten pages, it was like night and day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15361">New characters were added, elaborate action sequences conceived, and gimmicks introduced that had absolutely nothing to do with the story line at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15362">It was as if they had worked so hard writing the first ten pages they didn’t know what to do in the second ten. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15363">They seemed “obligated” to create complicated scenes in order to “break free” of that opening section and let loose, regardless of whether it fit the story or not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15364">The results were awful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15365">It was all confusion and no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15366">The reader was lost. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15367">The story line wandered around and around in search of itself, going nowhere, with no direction.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15368">Nothing worked.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15369">Act I is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately thirty pages long and is held together with the context known as the Set-Up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15370">It should establish the main character, the premise, and dramatic situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15371">It has a sense of direction and follows a specific line of narrative and character development.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15372">I wanted to gain some insight into what had to be done to make this particular unit of dramatic action work as a cohesive whole. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15373">So I began exploring the second ten pages of good screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15374">When I started reading scripts with this in mind, I found that in this second unit of action, we learn more about the character, who he or she is, and many times follow him or her through “a day in the life.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15375">Film is behavior, so if we follow the character through a typical day, with the dramatic forces of the story line influencing their character and their actions, then we can begin to get a greater understanding of who they are.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15381">What does Gittes do?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15382">First, on page 11, he follows Mulwray from the city’s council chambers to the Los Angeles riverbed, then trails him to the beach where, after spending most of the afternoon and night, he learns water is being dumped from the city’s reservoirs into the ocean during the middle of a drought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15383">When it gets too late, he puts some cheap watches under the tires of Mulwray’s car and leaves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15384">When he picks them up the next day he learns that the head of the Department of Water and Power was there until almost 3:00 </span><span class="smallcaps"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15385">A.M</span></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15386">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15387">The “guy’s got water on the brain,” he tells his associates. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15388">Pictures taken outside the restaurant, the Pig-n-Whistle, reveal Mulwray having a violent argument with Noah Cross (John Huston). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15389">The phone rings and Gittes learns that Mulwray has been spotted at Echo Park with “the girl.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15390">“Jesus,” Gittes says, “water again.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15391">He goes to the park, gets in a rowboat, takes pictures of Mulwray and “the little twist” he’s with, and as far as he’s concerned, the case is closed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15392">The next day, he’s surprised to see the pictures he took of Mulwray and “the girl” on the front page of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15393">The Times</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15394"> with the headline “Department of Water and Power Blows Fuse Over Chief’s Love Nest.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15402">Once I saw how clearly defined the action was in terms of the dramatic premise, I found that to be a pretty good “rule” for the second ten pages—</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15403">follow the focus of your main character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15404">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15405">He or she should be in almost every scene in these second ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15406">If we use the first ten pages to set up and establish what and who the story is about, then the next ten-page unit of dramatic action needs to focus on who he or she is.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15413">On page 7, we cut to the Shawshank Penitentiary where Red (Morgan Freeman) is once again rejected for his parole. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15414">We find out who he is, what he’s in prison for, and what his status is among the prisoner population. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15415">On page 8, Andy arrives at Shawshank to begin serving his term of two life sentences, “back to back.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15416">On page 10, Warden Norton addresses Andy and the others by laying down the rules: “Rule number one: no blaspheming. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15417">I’ll not have the Lord’s name taken in vain in my prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15418">The other rules you’ll figure out as you go along.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15419">The point is illustrated when the head of the prison guards, Hadley, severely beats down one of the convicts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15420">“Put your faith in the Lord,” Norton says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15421">“Your ass belongs to me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15422">Welcome to Shawshank.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15427">The next morning, on page 17, Andy meets Red and the others, and on page 19, he is assigned to the laundry room. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15428">We see a shot of him working, then cut to the showers where he is hustled by The Sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15429">He tries to be polite but they are like “jackals sizing up prey.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15430">That’s the end of the second ten pages.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15683">Many of the people kept writing during the break. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15684">They didn’t want to lose the discipline and creative energy they had built up during the first class. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15685">But when they returned to start the second act class and showed me the pages they had written, I was astonished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15686">They were awful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15687">There was no direction, no line of development, no trace of an organic story line, and almost no conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15688">In my own writing experience, Act II had always been the most difficult material to get through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15689">To face sixty blank sheets of paper can be daunting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15690">It’s easy to go into “overwhelm” or just “check out” or simply “get lost” in the maze of your own creation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15691">The hardest thing about writing, after all, is knowing what to write.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15796">As I was pondering this question, I got a phone call from an old friend of mine, Deneen Peckinpah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15797">Deneen and I had both attended UC Berkeley and we had worked and acted together with Jean Renoir during the world premiere of his play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15798">Carola</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15799">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15800">Deneen had played the lead character, Carola, while I had played her lover, Campan, the stage manager. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15801">We had kept in touch periodically over the years but we hadn’t seen each other for a long time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15802">She told me she was in town staying with her uncle in Malibu. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15803">Suddenly, the name Peckinpah struck a chord. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15804">Was her uncle, I asked, Sam Peckinpah? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15805">She laughed, and said yes and invited me out to the house.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15806">I had been a fan and admirer of Peckinpah ever since I wrote my first film review on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15807">Ride the High Country</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15808"> for a film magazine and a few days later I eagerly drove out to Malibu—a little too fast, a little too recklessly—but I was excited to see her again and possibly meet Sam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15809">When I arrived, Sam was in a meeting so Deneen and I walked along the beach and talked about the changes in our lives over the last several years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15810">During the conversation, I couldn’t help telling her how much I liked </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15811">Ride the High Country</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15812">, and how I wanted to write screenplays like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15813">She smiled and said Sam would like to hear that, especially now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15814">I didn’t know what she meant, but I would soon find out.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15844">When I thought about my students writing Act II, I wondered whether I could find some kind of incident, episode, or event, to act like a “centerpiece.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15845">It would not only move the action forward but would also break Act II down into two separate units of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15846">I knew that everyone could work in thirty-page units of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15847">If such an incident occurred around page 60, it would break Act II into two separate thirty-page units of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15848">The First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II would be connected by this midpoint event.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15850">Intuitively, that felt right to me, and more importantly I knew it would work—that some kind of scene or sequence in the middle of Act II would anchor the material within the context of structuring and writing the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15851">At this point, I began looking at films from this new perspective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15852">I had learned, through my own screenwriting experience, that the process of writing is asking yourself the right questions and then waiting for the right answers; it will be revealed when least expected. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15853">And that’s exactly what happened.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15854">At that time, back in the late ’70s, I was using Paul Mazursky’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15855">An Unmarried Woman</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15856"> as a teaching film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15857">So I looked at the film again, studying it, seeking some kind of insight about why the second act worked so well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15858">As mentioned in an earlier chapter, the set-up deals with Erica’s (Jill Clayburgh) successful seventeen-year marriage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15859">We meet her while she’s jogging with her husband, Martin (Michael Murphy), enjoys a “quickie” with him before he leaves for work, and then we see her getting her teenage daughter off to school, working part-time in an art gallery, and “hustled” by Charlie (Cliff Gorman), a painter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15860">We see her with her friends at lunch and from all outward appearances she is happy and content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15861">So far, so good; Act I shows us her good life and good marriage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15862">Then, about twenty-five minutes in the film, she and Martin are leaving a restaurant where they’ve been planning their summer vacation when he suddenly breaks down and blurts out, “I’m in love with another woman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15863">I want a divorce.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15864">Plot Point I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15865">From being a married woman in Act I, Erica suddenly becomes an unmarried woman in Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15866">Almost overnight, she is forced to adapt to a new lifestyle, a new beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15867">It’s not easy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15868">She has trouble being alone, she has trouble with her daughter, and she hates men—all men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15869">She goes into therapy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15870">When a blind date makes a pass at her, she throws him out of the taxi.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15871">Her therapist, a woman, tells Erica she’s got to give up her anger toward men; she should experiment a little, take some risks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15872">“I can’t tell you what to do, of course,” the therapist continues, “but I know what I would do.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15873">“What?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15874">Erica asks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15875">“I would go out and get laid.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15876">That happens on page 60. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15877">The next scene shows Erica at a singles bar, where she meets Charlie the painter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15878">She returns to his studio apartment and spends the night with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15879">It’s not the best of experiences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15880">From then on, all the way through to the end of Act II, when she meets Saul (Alan Bates), she explores her sexuality in a number of one-night stands. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15881">She doesn’t want a relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15882">When Saul tells her he wants to see her again, she says no. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15883">“I’m experimenting…I want to know how it feels to make love with a man I’m not in love with.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15884">The scene with the therapist on page 60 bridges the action between the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15885">From approximately page 30 to page 60, the main character is “anti-men”; from about page 60 to page 90, she “explores her sexuality” with a series of one-night stands.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15886">Interesting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15887">When I drew it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15888">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15889"> here’s how it looked:</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15891">Once again I thought about what Peckinpah had told me about the “centerpiece.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15892">At this point, I wasn’t sure whether I was trying to force some kind of incident or event to fit my expectation, or whether my observation was a natural, intuitive moment in the storytelling process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15893">I didn’t want to try and fit a round peg into a square hole.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15894">But a while later I recalled Paul Schrader (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15895">Taxi Driver, Cat People, American Gigolo</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15896">) telling me that when he writes a screenplay, “something happens” around page 60.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15897">Page 60. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15898">Like Sam Peckinpah, it seemed he would hang a story around a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15899">centerpiece</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15900">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15901">Thinking about the relationship between these three things—Sam’s statement, Paul Schrader’s conversation, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15902">An Unmarried Woman</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15903">, I wondered if the same thing happened in other screenplays as well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15904">So I started exploring several screenplays that I had been using as teaching films such as: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15905">Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15906"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15907">Three Days of the Condor</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15908"> (Lorenzo Semple, Jr. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15909">and David Rayfiel), among others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15910">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15911">Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15912">, Alvy and Annie meet at Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15913">The first part of Act II deals with establishing their relationship, and then, midway through the second act, they decide to move in together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15914">Wouldn’t that be some kind of Mid-Point? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15915">I wondered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15916">After they move in, their relationship moves to a new level.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15917">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15918">Three Days of the Condor</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15919">, Joseph Turner (Robert Redford), a member of a CIA “reading cell,” returns to his office after getting lunch for his colleagues and finds everyone murdered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15920">Who did it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15921">And why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15922">Shocked, he seeks safety on the streets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15923">Finally, he doesn’t know where to go or who to trust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15924">And halfway through the Second Act, he takes Kathy (Faye Dunaway) hostage and that act begins the bonds of their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15925">In both films, these incidents happen about midway through the Second Act.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15926">When I drew it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15927">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15928">, it looked like this:</span></p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15930">It seemed to make sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15931">And the more films I saw, the more scripts I read, and the more I thought about it, I began to see there was definitely some kind of incident that occurred in the middle of Act II that could be used as an anchoring point to organize and structure the action throughout the Second Act.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15932">So, I called it the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15933">Mid-Point;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15934"> it is some kind of incident, episode, or event that occurs around page 60, and breaks Act II into two basic units of dramatic action: the First Half of Act II, and the Second Half of Act II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15935">The incident I called the Mid-Point is a plot point, yes, but more important, its function in the Second Act is to be </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15936">a link in the chain of dramatic action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15937">, and to break Act II into two distinct units of dramatic action: the First Half of Act II goes from the end of Plot Point I to the Mid-Point, and the Second Half of Act II goes from the Mid-Point to Plot Point II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15938">I started using the construct of the Mid-Point in my screenwriting workshops, my consultations, and in the analyzing of screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15939">I saw how beneficial it was, in terms of teaching and evaluating the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15940">Once again, it showed me that the hardest thing about writing really is knowing what to write.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15941">When I began teaching the Mid-Point in my seminars and workshops, I was amazed at the results. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15942">My students suddenly had a firm grasp on Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15943">In their own words they told me that they now felt as if they had some control over their material—it no longer controlled them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15944">Now, as they were writing the material they didn’t get lost; they knew where they were going and how to get there.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15945">Since that time, I’ve taught thousands of screenwriting workshops, all over the world, and the power of organizing Act II into two distinct units of dramatic action (the First Half and Second Half, connected by the Mid-Point), has proven over and over again, beyond any doubt, to be functional, efficient, and liberating.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15946">Take a look at how it works in contemporary film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15947">In </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-45"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15948">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15949">, we saw how the key incident in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15950">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15951"> structurally holds the whole film together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15952">The Mid-Point, when Jason Bourne confronts Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), bridges the action and moves the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15953">It is the first time that Jason puts a name to a face and learns who, specifically, is after him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15954">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15955">King Kong</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15956"> (Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh), the first half of the film sets up the situation and characters, and chronicles their voyage until they reach the island at Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15957">That is the true beginning of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15958">Midway through the Second Act, we meet the giant gorilla.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16183">One overcast Saturday morning, at the Palais des Beaux Arts, I showed the film to several European filmmakers, and after the screening we sat around and discussed it in front of a large audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16184">I started talking about the Mid-Point, and how it starts the connection between Hollis Mulwray, Jake Gittes, and Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16185">Mulwray. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16186">In the scene, Gittes wants some information from Yelburton, the new head of the Department of Water and Power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16187">The secretary tells him that Yelburton is in a meeting and will be tied up indefinitely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16188">“I’ll wait,” Gittes says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16189">He lights up a cigarette, plops down in the chair, and makes himself at home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16190">“I take a long lunch,” he mentions to the secretary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16191">“All day, sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16192">He starts humming to himself, and the secretary gets nervous and edgy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16193">Then, he gets up and prowls along the wall, looking at the photographs that detail the history of the department. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16194">There are several photographs of Hollis Mulwray and a man named Noah Cross (John Huston) standing together at various construction sites.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16195">Cross. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16196">The name rings a bell to Gittes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16197">He takes out Evelyn Mulwray’s envelope and looks at the monogram: ECM. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16198">He asks the secretary if Noah Cross worked for the water department. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16199">Flustered, the secretary says yes, then no. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16200">“Noah Cross </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16201">owned</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16202"> the water department,” she tells him, “along with Mulwray.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16203">They were partners, she explains. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16204">Mulwray felt the public should own the water but Cross didn’t agree, and they had a falling out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16205">Something clicks for Gittes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16206">Evelyn Mulwray is Noah Cross’ daughter; that means she married her father’s business partner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16207">Whose side is Evelyn on—her father’s or her dead husband’s? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16208">Suddenly Gittes realizes that Noah Cross could have a very strong motive for killing Hollis Mulwray.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16209">Now things start to make sense; the information is a vital link in the dramatic action of Act II, and the first clue that points to the solution of the puzzle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16210">Ultimately it leads to Gittes proving that Cross is the man responsible for the murders and the water scandal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16211">It is a link in the chain of dramatic action, an essential clue to Gittes understanding of what’s going on.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16229">Knowing the Mid-Point is an essential tool that allows you to focus your story line into a specific line of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16230">With it, you now have a direction, a line of development. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16231">Once you know your Mid-Point, you can structure and organize your material by establishing the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II, and the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16232">It is an anchoring point so you can “build” your story line, confident and secure that you know where you’re going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16233">It becomes the story progression to move your story forward into the Second Half of Act II.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16378">If your action takes place over three hours, three days, three weeks, three months, or a three-year period, you can choose to visualize the passage of time by certain transitions to focus the narrative line into a sharp visual presentation (see more about this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16379">The Screenwriter’s Problem Solver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16380">). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16381">If you’re adapting something—a novel, play, biography, article, or news story—you can bridge and accent time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16382">The novel </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16383">Six Days of the Condor</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16384"> by James Grady was changed to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16385">Three Days of the Condor</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16386"> in order to make it a tighter, leaner visual presentation that generates greater tension and drama.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16387">You may decide that Act II takes place within a two-month period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16388">The First Half may be two weeks, the Second Half six weeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16389">The passage of time can be marked in several ways as mentioned: by seasonal changes, or by specific dialogue references to events like Memorial Day, Labor Day, Christmas, or Halloween, or using an event like an election, a birth, a wedding, or a funeral.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16390">What is the time frame that occurs during Act II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16391">Think about the First Half of Act II: What is the time frame for your action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16392">Decide how long or short it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16393">Find a workable time frame within which to operate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16394">Trust that the story will tell you what the time period is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16395">Don’t get too hung up with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16396">Don’t make it too significant or important.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16397">The time frame is what keeps your story in motion, moving forward from scene to scene, sequence to sequence, act to act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16398">It supports the action, and is held together by the context.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16399">When you begin to outline the action for the First Half of Act II, you have the sub-dramatic context and the time frame which will hold it all together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16400">You have a direction, a line of development that determines what happens in the action leading to the Mid-Point and from there to Plot Point II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16401">The importance of sub-dramatic context and the time frame gives you greater structural support and enhances the dramatic tension by highlighting the obstacles your main character needs to overcome in order to achieve his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16402">When you’ve completed this for the First Half of Act II, do it for the Second Half. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16403">The two units of action are separate and independent even though they are part of the larger whole of Act II and connected by the Mid-Point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16404">One of the things I discovered in my many workshops here and abroad is that to build this First and Second Half of Act II, there needs to be one major sequence that holds the material together.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16405">During the screenwriting workshop in Brussels, I worked with three European screenwriters, one on one, in front of a large audience of about a hundred people: filmmakers, writers, directors, actors, and many producers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16406">The writers worked on their scripts during this particular two-week workshop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16407">They would discuss their stories and the pages coming up, the audience would raise questions, and when the session was completed, they would go home and write pages for the next session. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16408">Then they would come in with their work, anywhere from five to ten pages, and everyone in the course would read them silently together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16409">They were translated for me as I don’t read French or Flemish. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16410">Next, I would comment on the pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16411">Questions were raised and dramatic choices explained: Why is this scene better “here” than “there?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16412">Why use the main character here and not another character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16413">Can we change this scene to another locale, or to another act? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16414">Do we have to know what happens to the characters between the scenes? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16415">What’s the purpose of that scene?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16416">We began working on the material for Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16417">As we started outlining and building the material from Plot Point I to the Mid-Point, I realized that all we needed was one key sequence to hold the entire First Half of Act II in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16418">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16419">Because the dramatic context holds the story in place, but at the same time, moves it forward.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16421">All you need is one important sequence occurring around page 45 in the First Half, and one sequence occurring around page 75 in the Second Half to anchor the thirty-page units of action in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16422">That’s all you need to “hold” these pages together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16423">In the First Half of Act II, that means you need about fifteen pages to get you to that particular sequence and after it’s written you only need about fifteen pages to get you to the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16424">Same with the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16425">From the Mid-Point to this particular sequence you need about fifteen pages and once you’ve written it, another ten to fifteen pages to take you to the Plot Point at the end of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16426">Two incidents, each one a story progression, one on approximately page 45 and one on approximately page 75, and you now have two stabilizing sequences that hold these two units of action in place.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16432">During the remainder of the Brussels workshop I advised my screenwriters to organize their First Half material around this one sequence, at approximately page 45, and another sequence which occurs around page 75. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16433">Both sequences are story progression points and their function is to simply keep the story on track. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16434">The writers loved working with these scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16435">They could build up to them, execute them, then move toward the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16436">I’ve learned that this one sequence can be an action sequence, a dialogue sequence, or anything you want it to be as long as it moves the story forward.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16437">The screenwriters told me that I needed to identify these two story progression points, so when I returned from my workshops abroad I started using these two sequences and my students immediately confirmed their importance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16438">They told me it was the most important element in writing Act II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16439">I decided to call these two sequences Pinch I, in the First Half of Act II, and Pinch II for the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16440">I thought labeling them as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16441">Pinch I</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16442"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16443">Pinch II</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16444"> was appropriate because these sequences simply “pinch” the story line together to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16445">keep your story on track</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16446">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16447">That is their function.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16448">The definition of a Pinch is simple: it is a sequence that keeps the action moving forward to the Mid-Point, or to Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16449">It is just a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16450">little pinch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16451"> in the story line that keeps the action on track, moving the story forward either to the Mid-Point or Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16452">Yes, it is a Plot Point, but more important, it is a sequence the keeps the story on track and moving forward.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16454">Sometimes there’s a relationship between Pinch I and Pinch II, some kind of story connection. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16455">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16456">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16457">, at Pinch I the two girls pick up J.D. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16458">(Brad Pitt), only to have him steal their money at the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16459">Pinch II occurs when J.D. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16460">is picked up by the police and tells them that Thelma and Louise are heading to Mexico. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16461">This kind of symmetry doesn’t happen all the time; it really depends upon your story line and situation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16462">The more I use Pinch I and Pinch II as an anchoring sequence in the structuring of Act II, the more valuable I find them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16463">When you approach structuring Act II, you build the story line in units of dramatic action; we build the First Half of Act II, then the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16464">As mentioned, first we determine the Mid-Point, then establish the sub-dramatic context of the First Half, then the sub-dramatic context of the Second Half. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16465">Only when you have the context of this unit of action can you determine Pinch I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16466">What is the incident, episode, or event that keeps the story on track?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16467">Once you establish that, you can move forward into the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16468">You know the Mid-Point and you know Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16469">What is the theme of action that keeps the story moving forward to Plot Point II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16470">That’s your sub-dramatic context. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16471">Write it down on the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16472">Next, determine Pinch II, that sequence that keeps the story on track heading toward Plot Point II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16473">Now, the nice thing about structure is that it’s flexible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16474">We can always move these structural points up and down, or forward and backward, on the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16475">We always have to keep in mind that this is just the starting point, not the end point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16476">Once you’ve structured these points on the paradigm, we’re ready to begin structuring Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16477">We’re going to start with the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16478">Take fourteen cards, just the way we did in </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-47"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16479">Chapter 9</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16480">, and lay out the action the same way you did for Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16481">To repeat, before you lay out your fourteen cards for the First Half of Act II, you must have established your Mid-Point, determined the sub-dramatic context, and established Pinch I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16482">Now, lay out these fourteen cards, using free-association, for the First Half. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16483">Just throw them down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16484">Now, what card do you think Pinch I will be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16485">Card number 7. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16486">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16487">Because it occurs about halfway through the First Half of Act II, approximately page 45.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16488">Go over and over the cards until they feel comfortable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16489">Remember that the essence of Act II is conflict, so seek out those conflicts, either internal or external, whenever and wherever you can. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16490">And remember, the purpose of each scene is to either move the story forward or reveal information about the character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16491">If you get lost somewhere in the creative maze that is Act II, you could spend days, perhaps weeks, in frustration and despair trying to find your way out of the pit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16492">But as you’re writing Act II, you have to understand that you have no objectivity at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16493">If you doubt yourself in terms or the material, you’ll start censoring everything, and you won’t be able to write anything! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16494">If you don’t watch out, that’s when you’ll become your own victim and start to experience writer’s block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16495">Don’t let that happen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16496">Keep writing no matter how you feel about it, whether you think it’s good, bad, or indifferent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16497">Just write your story, page by page, scene by scene, shot by shot, and leave all your judgments and evaluations in the nightstand drawer next to your bed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16498">Breaking Act II into the First and Second Half, then establishing the sub-dramatic context and time frame, then Pinch I and Pinch II, allows you to gain a structural overview that keeps your story on track. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16499">It will guide you through the obstacle course that leads to the next step in the screenwriting process—the actual writing of Act II.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16502">Let’s do the following exercise as a “tune-up.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16503">Look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16504">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16505"> (on the previous page): we have a story about a young woman in an unhappy marriage who enrolls in an art class and ends up having an affair with her teacher.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16506">The way it’s broken down and structured is the same way we structure all our exercises: we choose the ending first, the beginning next, then Plot Points I and II, then the Mid-Point, then the time frame, then we establish the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II, than the sub-dramatic context for the Second Half, and only then do we determine Pinches I and II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16507">In Act I, we set up our story by establishing the unhappy marriage of our main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16508">Plot Point I is when she enrolls in the art class.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16509">Since we know she’s going to have an affair with the teacher, and become pregnant at Plot Point II, the Mid-Point would be when she has sex with him for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16510">In that way, the First Half is where we see her juggling her art class, her painting, and her marriage, as well as her feelings about herself as she gets to know the teacher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16511">The sub-dramatic context of this First Half of Act II would focus on establishing the relationship between her and her teacher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16512">The sub-dramatic context of the Second Half of Act II deals with her falling in love with her teacher.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16513">Take another look at it on the paradigm.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16514">Go over the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16515">What incident, episode, or event do you think Pinch I is?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16516">Let’s look at the possibilities: It might be where the young woman and the teacher have an opportunity to get to know each other for the first time on a one-to-one basis. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16517">Maybe she wants an appraisal of her work and they go out for coffee after class; or her car won’t start in the parking lot and she borrows his cell phone; or he gives her a ride home and they decide they like each other; or they meet at a party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16518">Any such situation will work as Pinch I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16519">Our character is not about to jump right into bed with her teacher, no matter how unhappy she might be with her husband. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16520">She is cautious, and her actions will be appropriate to the circumstances. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16521">Otherwise, we don’t have any sympathy for her, and your main character must always be sympathetic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16522">And what about the teacher? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16523">Who is he? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16524">What kind of person is he? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16525">You would do a character biography on him just to see what kind of a person he is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16526">Student and teacher would spend time together getting to know each other, which we could show, and then, at Mid-Point, they have sex for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16527">That gives you about fifteen pages of script to visually reveal their relationship.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16528">During the Second Half of Act II the student falls in love with the teacher, leading us to Plot Point II, where she discovers she’s pregnant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16529">It could be a scene in a doctor’s office, or the results of a pregnancy test. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16530">If they have an intense and passionate scene making love, this might be the scene where she conceives.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16574">As mentioned earlier, the best and most effective way to enter Act II is from your character’s dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16575">It’s important to redefine what your main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16576">What is it that drives him or her through the action to bring a resolution to whatever crisis or situation, either emotional or physical, your character finds himself in? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16577">Can you define it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16578">Articulate it?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16579">Has your character’s dramatic need changed at Plot Point I? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16580">Remember, if your character’s dramatic need changes, it will change at Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16581">That is the true beginning of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16582">During the preparation of Act II, did you think about what obstacles your character might confront during this course of narrative action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16583">Preparing to write Act II means that you need to know approximately four major obstacles that your character confronts to get through the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16584">As with all obstacles, they can either be internal or external, physical or emotional, mental or spiritual.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16585">The foundation of all good writing is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16586">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16587">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16588">Stating it once again, all drama is conflict; without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16589">And without story you have no screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16590">Films like: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16591">The Hours, Chinatown, The Manchurian Candidate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16592">, A </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16593">Place in the Sun</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16594"> (Michael Wilson and Harry Brown), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16595">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16596">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16597">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16598"> have both internal and external conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16599">External conflict is where the conflict is outside the character, and the characters face physical (and in some part, emotional, of course) obstacles, such as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16600">Cold Mountain, Collateral, Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16601">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16602">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16603"> (Michael Crichton and David Koepp). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16604">Creating conflict within the story through characters and events is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16605">So what is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16606">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16607">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16608">If you look at the word it means to be “in opposition to,” and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character(s) be in opposition to someone or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16609">something</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16610">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16611">Conflict can be anything, a struggle, a quarrel, a battle, or a chase scene, fear of life, fear of failure or success, internal or external, any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16612">If you do not have enough conflict, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in a quagmire of dull writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16613">Conflict can be expressed either physically or emotionally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16614">You can talk about it through dialogue, or you can express it through physical acts, or you can have your character respond to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16615">Conflict, no matter what form it takes, becomes the engine that drives the story line through the second act.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16616">Remember too that dialogue is a function of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16617">Let’s review its purpose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16618">Dialogue:</span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16635">Your first attempts at writing dialogue in Act II will probably be unnatural, clichéd, fragmented, and strained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16636">Writing dialogue is like learning to swim; you’re going to flounder around a bit, but the more you do the easier it gets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16637">When you enter the First Half of Act II it may take you several pages to get into a rhythm of both story and dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16638">Don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16639">It takes anywhere from forty to fifty pages before your characters start talking to you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16640">And they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16641">do</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16642"> start talking to you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16643">Just let it be okay to write shitty pages, with stilted, direct, dumb, and obvious dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16644">Keep writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16645">Dialogue can always be cleaned up during the rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16646">“Writing is rewriting” is the ancient adage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16647">A word to those of you who are looking for “inspiration” to guide you during this process; sorry to say it but you’re probably not going to find it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16648">Inspiration is measured in moments, a few minutes, or hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16649">A screenplay depends on diligence and discipline and is measured in weeks and months. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16650">If it takes you a hundred days to write a screenplay and you’re “on” for ten of those days, consider yourself lucky. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16651">Being “on” for one hundred days, or twenty-five days, just doesn’t happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16652">Especially writing Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16653">You may “hear” that it does, but in truth it’s the pot at the end of the rainbow—you’re chasing a dream.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16654">“But…” you say.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16655">But what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16656">You mean, those stories, rumors, or hearsay that tells you that so and so wrote his or her screenplay that sold for millions in a week or two? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16657">Or, the second cousin of a friend of a friend’s friend knows someone who wrote the entire screenplay in two days? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16658">Is that what that “but” refers to?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16659">Forget it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16660">Writing, as I tell everyone who’s even thinking about writing a screenplay, is a day-by-day job, two to three hours a day, five or six days a week, either during the day or on weekends, three or more pages a day, ten pages or more a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16661">Shot by shot, scene by scene, sequence by sequence, page by page, act by act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16662">And some days are better than others.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16663">Just remember that when you’re </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16664">in</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16665"> the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16666">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16667">, you can’t </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16668">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16669"> the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16670">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16671">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16673">What’s nice about the card system is that once it’s done you can forget it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16674">But at this stage, where we’re writing Act II, we’re going to use the cards to build the First and Second Halves of Act II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16675">In review, one card equals one scene, but when you’re writing the screenplay, that is a contradiction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16676">As you’re writing Act II, you’ll suddenly “discover” a new scene that you hadn’t even thought about, or a scene that simply works better than what you put down on the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16677">If you’re in doubt about whether to use it or not use it, use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16678">That scene will lead you to veer off the path of the cards into a few new scenes or sequences that you hadn’t even considered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16679">I think that’s great. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16680">Do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16681">Write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16682">Pinches I and II and the Mid-Point will be your structural guidelines, keeping you on the path of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16683">If that happens, just go with it because it’s important to write those scenes or sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16684">You can tell within a few pages whether they are working or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16685">You’ll finish these new pages, feeling satisfied with your efforts, but then a sudden question might hit you: what happens next? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16686">And, you don’t have a clue, you don’t know what to do, or where to go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16687">Take a breath and just look at the next card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16688">You’ll find you have a perfect lead-in to the next scene you have organized on the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16689">And if those new scenes don’t work, just know that all you’ve lost is a couple of days, but you’ve maintained your creative energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16690">In reality, you haven’t lost anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16691">Your creative mind has assimilated those new scenes so you can throw out what you thought might work and still be following the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16692">direction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16693"> of your story.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16700">As you’re laying out the scenes, you’ll find once again that the actual writing experience differs from the way you laid out the cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16701">Don’t worry about changing the cards to fit the story, or adding new things in the development of the story and characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16702">At this point, you should be starting to feel comfortable with the form.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16703">Begin Act II by designing the opening scene or sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16704">You have your character’s dramatic need clearly in focus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16705">Now you can think about where to enter the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16706">Think about entering late and getting out early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16707">That is, try to enter the scene at the last possible moment just before the major “reveal” is established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16708">“Reveal” is what the scene is all about; either it moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16709">Each scene should be about one thing, should have one “beat” to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16710">Do you know what the purpose of the scene is? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16711">Where did your character come from? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16712">Where is he or she going to? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16713">Did you have to change his or her dramatic need? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16714">What about the conflict within the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16715">Is it internal, or external? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16716">What is the obstacle that keeps your character from achieving his or her dramatic need? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16717">If you don’t know, who does?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16955">It wasn’t too long ago that the screenwriter depended on the director or film editor to create these visual transitions, but it is really the writer’s responsibility to write the required transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16956">One of the recognizable traits of a professional screenwriter is his or her ability to write good visual transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16957">At the present time, there is an evolutionary trend in the style and sophistication of the art of transition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16958">Even a script like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16959">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16960">, which is sequential and episodic, uses effective transitions so the five episodes that make up the screenplay seem to be connected into a single story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16961">The title page even proclaims the script is really “three stories about one story.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16962">If Tarantino and Avery had not created those transitions, the script would have been disjointed and episodic and not worked as well as it does.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16963">As far as I’m concerned, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to write these transitional scenes that move the story forward and bridge time, place, and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16964">Writing good transitions is also a very good way to solve a number of problems.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16973">Why are transitions so important? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16974">Because when you’re reading a script, or seeing a movie, it has to flow smoothly across a time period that is usually not more than two hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16975">The story line has to be a seamless parade of images across the page or screen, and time, then, becomes a relative phenomenon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16976">Days and years and decades can be condensed into seconds, a few seconds stretched into minutes as a leap is made from one image to another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16977">That’s one of the things that makes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16978">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16979"> such a remarkable movie; the passage of time does not draw attention to itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16980">It becomes an integral part of the fabric of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16981">Transitions can be as varied and as multiple as the colors in a kaleidoscope. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16982">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16983">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16984">, for example, the screenwriter, Ted Tally, generally plays the last line of one scene over the first line of the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16985">The dialogue is used to bridge time and action and shows one way that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16986">sound</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16987"> can be used as the link connecting two different scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16988">Tally ends one scene with a question, then opens the next scene by answering that question.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16989">This kind of overlapping transition scene has been done many times before, of course, most notably in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16990">Julia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16991">, Alvin Sargent’s Academy Award–winning screenplay adapted from Lillian Hellman’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16992">Pentimento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16993">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16994">But the way Tally approached his transitions pushes the boundaries of the medium in such a way that we’re not even aware of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16995">If you’re watching a movie and become aware of the visual transitions, or feel the “arty” influence of the director in each scene, chances are it’s not a very good film.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17406">But when I read their stories, I was astonished; while the stories were good and interesting, there was a certain, uncomfortable consistency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17407">Out of the fifty stories, forty-eight of them ended in death, suicide, destruction, or mayhem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17408">I tried to explain that at this point in time they were living in an historical moment, and each writer had an unique opportunity to be focused on what kind of future they might want to create. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17409">But almost all of them had made a creative decision that their stories would be “true to life,” meaning they would end unhappily and generally “despairing.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17410">When I thought about it, I realized that they had come from a literary </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17411">Germanic</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17412"> tradition that usually ends unhappily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17413">And yet, they had the opportunity to bring forth something new that would reflect a future filled with new possibilities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17414">I’ve always maintained that as screenwriters we have a certain responsibility to alter and impact our audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17415">I think of it as kind of a mission statement: by choosing the creative act of writing a screenplay, we have the opportunity of giving rise to a new possibility, based not on the past, or old patterns of behavior, but on a future built on hope and unity and self-worth, where we honor our uniqueness and individuality, our humanity, so we can achieve a higher state of consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17416">That’s my point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17417">It’s a choice for you to make regarding the resolution of your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17418">So when you think about the ending of your screenplay, about the resolution of your stories, aim for the highest; it’s not necessary to end your story line in a simplistic manner, meaning by death, destruction, suicide, and mayhem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17419">I pointed that out to the German screenwriters, and while they come from that kind of historical and literary tradition, it reflects either an attachment to the past or a fear of the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17420">The future is what we make it.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17566">As you sit down at the computer, writing pad, or typewriter, and engage in the creative process of resolving your story line, you may find that things will be going smoothly and easily until the last few pages of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17567">Then you might feel strange, find yourself suddenly going “blank,” not knowing what to write or feeling that you have no real desire or enthusiasm or ambition to complete the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17568">You’ll look for, and find, every excuse you can to avoid writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17569">It’s really very funny; after weeks and months of preparation, research, commitment, pain, toil, and trouble, after weeks of self-doubt, fears, and insecurities, after weeks of working your ass off, you may suddenly want to chuck it, with only a few pages to write.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17570">It’s absurd; you really can’t take it too seriously.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17571">What do you do?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17572">First of all, this seems to be a somewhat common experience among writers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17573">It originates below the level of awareness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17574">Every writer I know, including myself, experiences this phenomenon. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17575">Emotionally</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17576">, you don’t want to end the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17577">You want to hang on, not finish it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17578">It’s like a terrible relationship—no matter how bad it is, it’s better than no relationship at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17579">The same principle applies to writing your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17580">It’s hard to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17581">It’s been a great part of your life; you think about it every day, your characters are like friends, you talk about your story every chance you get. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17582">Writing it has kept you awake at night, caused you pain and suffering, and given you great satisfaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17583">Of course you don’t want to give it up!</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17584">For what?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17585">It’s only natural to want “to hold on.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17586">I hate to spoil your illusions, but there’s a lot of work left to do on this screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17587">When you finish this first words-on-paper draft, you’re only a third of the way through the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17588">You’re not done with anything; the ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17589">You’ve got two more drafts to go before you complete this first-draft screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17590">Just finish your script; resolve it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17591">And once you write the final “Fade Out” give yourself a little pat on the back and celebrate with a glass of wine, or champagne, or whatever suits your disposition.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17592">Put your screenplay on the desk in front of you and see how many pages you’ve written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17593">Pick it up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17594">Feel it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17595">You did it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17596">Then take a week off.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17606">When you feel comfortable with your material, start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17607">You may begin to experience some resistance at this point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17608">Many times, in my own experience, I come up with a new idea, so compelling and powerful that I want to stop what I’m doing and just jump into the new idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17609">Don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17610">Take out a notebook or a piece of paper and simply write it down in two or three pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17611">Write as much as you want about the idea, then put it away and go back to completing Act III.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17612">If you experience any resistance, doubts, or judgments, or feel that you’re “burnt out,” just “bend with it” and acknowledge it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17613">Continue writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17614">Always keep your resolution—the solution—firmly in mind.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17615">If you want to change any of the details of the ending, do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17616">If your ending comes out different from what you want it to be, write it one way, put it away in a drawer somewhere, and then write it again; this time it will be the way you want it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17617">If you’re writing a comedy and it comes out serious and dramatic, write it down, stick it in a drawer, and then write it as a comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17618">The same with a drama; if it comes out funny, continue to write, knowing it’s only a form of resistance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17619">When you’ve finished and it’s out of your head and out of your system, stick it in a drawer somewhere and forget about it, then go back and write it the way you want to.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17620">What’s important is to create a resolution that is honest and entrenched in the integrity of your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17621">If you try to figure out what “they” want, what you think the public would like, or what the production companies would like to see in order to sell your material, forget it; it’ll never work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17622">There’s no way you can “figure” out what “they” want. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17623">Just write your screenplay from the position that this is your screenplay and this is how the story is resolved and this is the ending you have chosen for now.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17638">I knew it was a line for a song. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17639">He reached into my glove compartment, pulled out an old envelope, grabbed a pen, wrote down the line, added a few more words, hummed a musical phrase, and in that moment the entire song came to him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17640">It took him only a few minutes to write down the lyrics.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17641">When we got back to my house, he sat down at the piano and began to play various phrases tying it all together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17642">About 10 minutes later he said “listen to this” and he played the song’s musical line for me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17643">It sounded good, even though it was rough and somewhat sketchy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17644">Several days later he called and invited me to meet him at a recording studio in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17645">He was going to record the song, he told me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17646">As I walked into the studio, I saw a huge orchestra on the stage, a number of backup singers, and a major recording artist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17647">They started their rehearsals, and I heard the full song performed for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17648">Needless to say, I was blown away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17649">From a few scribbled lines on an old envelope to this intense musical experience within the space of a little more than a week! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17650">I couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17651">I was jealous as hell; I wished I could write a screenplay or a book like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17652">I left the studio filled with a sense of wonder mingled with a layer of personal resentment and a lot of self-pity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17653">When I think of the hours, the days, the weeks, the months, and in some cases, the years, of arduous and tedious work that goes into writing a screenplay or a book, it’s no wonder I felt the way I did.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17654">I wished I could write a screenplay that way, but it’s not to be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17655">Oh sure, I’ve heard stories of screenwriters who write a script in a week, or two, and they may all be true—but what you don’t hear is how long they must have worked on the idea and characters and plot before they sat down to actually write the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17656">That musical experience with my friend haunted me because I was measuring his experience of writing that one particular song against my own experience of writing a screenplay or book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17657">And I knew there was no way I could measure his songwriting experience against my own writing experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17658">The more I thought about it, the more I saw that writing a screenplay is composed of many individual stages and they’re all different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17659">Each phase is totally separate and unique. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17660">You may get a flash of inspiration for a screenplay in a few moments, but executing it is a quite different story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17661">Writing is a detailed, step-by-step process, a day-by-day progression, and you move through it in stages, making it better and more complete as you go along.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17662">It’s only natural. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17663">Science teaches us that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17664">The scientific method since the time of Francis Bacon deals with measuring things or making tests which involve experimentation and measurable results. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17665">A scientist will try different things, exploring each possible alternative intelligently and systematically, always keeping a record of what works and discarding what doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17666">So many people I talk to share with me that they don’t like the idea of having to rewrite their material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17667">After all, they’ve spent many months working on this first words-on-paper draft and feel that any changes that may need to be made should be authorized by someone who is going to buy or produce the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17668">In other words, they should be paid for rewriting the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17669">Nothing could be farther from the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17670">The old adage “writing is rewriting” is a truism, like it or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17671">Rewriting your screenplay is a necessary and essential part of the screenwriting process; it corrects the changes you might have made during the first words-on-paper draft, and clarifies and defines your story as well as sharpening your characters and situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17672">You want your screenplay to be the best that you can make it—otherwise why spend all this time writing it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17673">It would be easier not to do it at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17674">Whether you like the idea of rewriting or not, at some point you’re going to have to do it; you can’t argue with it, you don’t need to fight it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17675">Just accept it because that’s just the way it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17676">Nobody ever told you that writing a screenplay was going to be easy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17677">When you complete your first words-on-paper draft you know you’re going to have to make changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17678">That’s a given. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17679">Your screenplay is a living thing and it changes and grows from day to day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17680">It is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17681">process</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17682">, and what you write today may be out of date tomorrow and what you write tomorrow may be out of date the day after the day after tomorrow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17683">Don’t expect creative inspiration to be your guide because you’re going to be changing and correcting a lot of what you wrote the first time around.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17684">Writing the first-draft screenplay is done in three distinct stages: the first stage is writing the words-on-paper draft, which you’ve just finished; the second stage is writing what I call the “mechanical” draft, where you correct any changes made during the writing; and finally, the third stage, which I term the “polish” draft, where you’re polishing scenes and sequences until you’ve done the best job you can and the first draft is completed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17685">When you finish the first words-on-paper draft, you’re ready to begin the process of rewriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17686">First, take a couple of days off to think about what you’ve done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17687">What parts do you think work the best? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17688">What doesn’t work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17689">Are your characters fully fleshed out? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17690">Do you know already what changes you want to make? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17691">Just let these thoughts “cook” a little bit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17692">You don’t need to make any clear-cut or defined decisions at this point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17693">The first thing in the rewriting process is to see what you’ve actually got. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17694">At this stage, you may not even know or remember what you did in Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17695">It’s easy to forget that when you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm; you have no sense of overview, no objective perspective about what you’ve done or not done.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17696">You need some kind of an overview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17697">You’ll need to clarify your “take” on the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17698">You want to see what you’ve written with objective eyes and not be burdened with any subjective comments, likes or dislikes, judgments or evaluations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17699">You need to “unplug” from your subjective view to gain an “objective” overview.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17700">The way to do that is to read the entire first draft in one sitting from beginning to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17701">Lock up all pens, pencils, notes, and papers, shut the computer down, and just jump in and start reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17702">Resist the temptation to write notes in the margins about the changes you want to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17703">This exercise is for you just to read what you’ve got. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17704">It’s the best way to gain objectivity.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17705">As you’re reading the screenplay you’ll notice you’re on a roller coaster of emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17706">You’ll read a scene and think to yourself how bad it really is, how could anybody write such drivel?; or, this is the worst thing I’ve ever read; or, the incidents and events of the story are so unbelievable and so predictable, nobody will believe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17707">You’ll feel totally depressed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17708">Just keep reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17709">Then, you’ll read a scene you’ve written and think it’s not too bad, and then you’ll find another scene that works really well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17710">Certain scenes you’ll see are way too long and talky, but they can always be cut and trimmed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17711">You’ll be swinging on a pendulum of emotion, shifting between elation and despair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17712">Just ride the roller coaster and don’t get too plugged into your emotional response, whether it’s despair, depression, or suicide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17713">Just read the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17714">It’s easy to get distracted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17715">One my students, a well-known actress, had completed her first words-on-paper draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17716">Late one night she called after she had read her script through for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17717">No sooner had I picked up the receiver than I heard her scream in my ear: “How could you let me write this…this piece of shit…it’s awful!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17718">and she burst into tears and banged the phone down forcefully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17719">I looked at the phone, not sure how to react or what I should say or do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17720">So I did nothing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17721">Later, she told me that after she read what she had written, she threw the script down in total despair, called me, then crawled into bed, turned the electric blanket up as high as it would go, and assumed the prenatal position with thumb in mouth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17722">She stayed that way for two days.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17723">She overreacted, of course, and often, when you read something you’ve written, it can be a devastating experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17724">If this happens to you, just ride it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17725">I waited about four days before I finally called her back because I knew she was going to have to deal with all those “unreal” expectations and emotions she had suffered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17726">We talked at length about it and she shared that she was numb, she didn’t feel anything at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17727">I suggested she wait a few days before she confronted her material again and “just do what you have to do to make it work.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17728">When she finally did sit down to rework the material, she told me she felt like a machine, with no emotion at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17729">When she was able to move from a subjective view into an objective overview, when she didn’t react to any of her judgments and expectations, and just concentrated on writing her story, it turned out very well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17730">It took her about two weeks to regain her confidence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17731">After all, she had taken her idea, formed it into a story line, then written and completed a first words-on-paper draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17732">That’s quite an accomplishment.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17733">So, when you finish this first reading, take some time to think about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17734">Contemplate your overall feelings about the story, the characters, and the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17735">As you begin to mentally “cruise” through the progression of the story line from beginning to end, you’ll move into an overview position to balance the characters and the relationships that exist between them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17736">Is the story set up correctly? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17737">What about the relationships between the characters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17738">Are they believable? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17739">Do they talk too much, or explain too much? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17740">Are the conflicts and obstacles your character confronts during Act II clearly defined? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17741">Do parts of the second act drag and sag? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17742">Does your ending work effectively?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17743">Is there anything you would like to change?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17744">Think about it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17745">After you read it, the next stage in the rewriting process is to sit down and write three essays, using free-association or automatic writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17746">Writing these essays allows you to unplug from the material and provides an effective overview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17747">Each essay should be a couple of pages long; what’s important is to let the ideas flow naturally and spontaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17748">Don’t try to force your story line to conform to your own expectations.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17814">What’s so important about these essays is to get clear on what you’ve written, so you can make it better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17815">The best way to approach the rewrite process is by working in sections, or units, of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17816">That means working in Act I until you complete this unit of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17817">Then stop and work on the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17818">Define, change, add, or drop scenes, trim the dialogue until the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17819">Then stop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17820">Go into the Second Half of Act II and do the same thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17821">This way, the material does not become overwhelming and you can be more in control by working in sections, in units of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17822">Do the same in Act III.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17823">Now, on this second, or “mechanical” draft, reread the material in Act I but this time you’re going to be making notes in the margins: scenes you may want to change, dialogue you would like to add, or scenes you want to cut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17824">Some scenes will be okay the way they are; some will not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17825">Any dialogue changes, scene changes, or shifts in action, plot, or character, will need to be integrated into the script as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17826">We had mentioned earlier that dialogue has two possible functions: either it moves the story forward, or it reveals character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17827">Keep this in mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17828">When you’re working with dialogue, it’s interesting to note that the word itself comes from the Greeks and it means “a flow of meaning.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17829">Keep this in mind as you’re writing; is your dialogue flowing smoothly, or is your script “too talky,” or too explanatory? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17830">Are you sacrificing character for action, or action for character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17831">You’ll want to open up your story visually, utilizing both INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17832">and EXT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17833">locations, telling your story with pictures and words.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17834">Continue rewriting until you complete the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17835">Always remember the context; you are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17836">setting up your story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17837">, setting up your characters and relationships, as well as establishing the dramatic premise and situation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17838">Each unit is a separate and complete unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17839">You’ll find yourself doing more rewriting in Act I and the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17840">These two units of action are usually where you need to make the most changes, because that’s where your story started to change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17841">Check it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17842">See if that’s accurate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17843">In most cases, you’ll be rewriting almost 80 percent, or more, of this First Act material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17844">So what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17845">Just do it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17846">You’ll find rewriting Act I will be easier than you thought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17847">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17848">Because you’ve already established your writing discipline, and you know the story and the changes you want to make, so writing them should be natural and easy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17849">Sometimes you might have difficulty deciding what to do, especially if Act I is too long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17850">If that happens, you might need to cut a few scenes and move them from Act I into Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17851">Structure is flexible, right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17852">Or, you may want to enter each scene at a later point in the action and end it earlier. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17853">(If you would like more guidance, read Chapters 9–11 in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17854">The Screenwriter’s Problem Solver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17855">.)</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17856">As mentioned, this second draft is what I call the mechanical draft, meaning this particular stage of the rewrite is more about getting it down on paper than being clever and original. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17857">It’s “mechanical” because you just want to get the script in shape with a consistent narrative line, laying down scenes and dialogue which you know are not perfect but are used as a stepping-stone to the final, polish stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17858">This is where you are equalizing the story from what you started out to write and shaping it to fit what you did write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17859">Usually, I just throw the scenes down to get them on paper, and don’t worry about how good or bad they are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17860">I’m just smoothing things out, mechanically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17861">You’ll correct any changes you made during the first words-on-paper stage, bring the script to the proper length, tighten up the dramatic tension, and sharpen the focus of your main character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17862">Even though you’re going to possibly change a lot of things, perhaps rewriting 80 to 85 percent of Act I, maybe 50 to 60 percent of the First Half of Act II, 25 to 30 percent of the Second Half of Act II, and about 10 or 15 percent of Act III, don’t think of this as a “creative” draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17863">This draft should not take the same time or effort required as when you were confronting the blank sheet of paper in the first-words-on-paper draft.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17864">Concentrate on telling your story visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17865">You may find that you have the tendency to tell most of your story in dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17866">Maybe you’re “talking” your story, explaining the character’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17867">For example, your character may be driving a car, see a jewelry store and say “I need a jade ring,” and explain </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17868">why</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17869"> she needs the ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17870">Then you might show her walking into the store and looking at the rings while she tells the salesperson exactly what she’s looking for and why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17871">She’ll purchase the ring and then you might cut into the next scene, where she is showing off her new jade ring at a party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17872">That’s basically a scene of explanation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17873">You don’t want too many of those.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17874">Instead, you can show the same thing visually: she sees the store, enters, and then cut into the next scene at the party where she is now showing off her new ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17875">Woody Allen did something like this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17876">Match Point</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17877">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17878">We’ve seen Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) caught in his emotional dilemma; he doesn’t know how or what to tell his wife, Chloe, (Emily Mortimer) about Nola (Scarlett Johansson) being pregnant with his child. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17879">Then, one night, he suddenly wakes up, eyes wide open as he realizes what he has to do to resolve the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17880">He doesn’t say anything and we don’t know at this point what his plan may be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17881">But at the moment he wakes up, he suddenly knows how he’s going to get out of his predicament. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17882">That silent, unspoken moment is the Plot Point at the end of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17883">And in Act III, we then see how Chris solves his particular “problem.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17884">Think visually, continually being aware of any cinematic transitions you might use as you move from one scene to the next and always looking for ways to enter and leave the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17885">Enter late and get out early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17886">Transitions are always a good way of cutting down the material, if that’s something you need to do.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17887">If you like, when you finish Act I of this mechanical draft, go back and clean it up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17888">Polish a scene or retype some pages, cut out a few lines of dialogue to make it clearer and tighter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17889">Don’t spend too much time on it; it’s important to move forward through the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17890">Always work from beginning to end, beginning to end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17891">Move on to the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17892">Reread the material and make extensive notes in the margins on what you need to do to make it work, until you reach the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17893">You’ll find you might be changing about 60 percent of the First Half. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17894">Determine what changes you want to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17895">Then, if need be, lay out this section on 3 × 5 cards, just like you did with the Act I material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17896">Always keep in mind your sub-dramatic context and strive for conflict, either internal conflict or external, or both, whatever works most effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17897">Make sure Pinch I is clean and tight and the Mid-Point clearly defined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17898">Sometimes, you may find that you have too many characters and need to condense two characters into one character; or use the first part of one scene on page 40 with the last part of the scene on page 55. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17899">Whatever you need to do to make your story work, do it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17900">Does your Mid-Point still work effectively? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17901">Is it too long or too short? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17902">Too wordy? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17903">Or does it need exposition, action, or visual clarification? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17904">Do you need to redefine it visually? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17905">Again, just write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17906">It doesn’t have to be perfect at this point.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17907">You’ll probably spend a week or two rewriting the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17908">After you’ve completed the Mid-Point, you can stop and move on to the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17909">Read it through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17910">Make notes on any changes you want to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17911">If need be, and if you feel comfortable doing it, you may want to restructure the Second Half on fourteen 3 × 5 cards just like Act I and the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17912">Sometimes you’ll feel like doing this and other times you won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17913">You be the judge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17914">You’re clarifying and redefining your story line so you want to make it as concise and visual as you can.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17915">Once you know what you need to do, execute it simply, keeping the dramatic context and time frame clearly in mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17916">You probably won’t have to change more than 25 to 30 percent of the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17917">Just keep your story on track as you follow your main character through the action, setting up Pinch II and then moving on to Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17918">This section may only take you about a week or so to complete, depending on how much time you can devote and what you need to do.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17919">When you finish Act II, don’t spend too much time polishing the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17920">You’re going to be doing this the next time around, in the third and final “polish” draft.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17921">When you reach Act III, you’ll really be home free. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17922">You know the resolution of your story, you’re in a good creative flow, and any changes you’ve made earlier in the material should have already been paid off in this unit of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17923">Rewriting this part of the screenplay is usually the easiest and takes the shortest amount of time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17924">You’ll feel like you’re almost done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17925">In Act III, you’ll be cleaning up and refocusing the resolution, and you’ll want to look for ways to add any new visual dynamics to make your ending stronger and more effective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17926">Here’s where you may have a better idea for your ending, and if that’s the case, change it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17927">Now’s the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17928">You may want to write a new dialogue scene or make it more visual, but first you’ll want to make sure you have resolved your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17929">The actual writing process itself at this time is pretty clear-cut and manageable and you’ll probably know exactly what you need to do to finish this second draft of your screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17930">You should be able to complete this “mechanical” draft of your screenplay in about four to five weeks, and it should end up being anywhere from one hundred ten to one hundred twenty pages, no longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17931">Bringing it to the proper length should be one of your first priorities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17932">If you’re a first-time screenwriter, defined as someone who has never had a screenplay produced or purchased, they (whoever “they” are) are not going to accept a screenplay from you that is longer than one hundred twenty to one hundred twenty-five pages long.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17933">Sorry to be the one to tell you this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17934">Your story line needs to be clear, with all the necessary changes fused into an organic story line from beginning to end, within one hundred twenty pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17935">The average screenplay today is approximately one hundred twelve to one hundred twenty pages long.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17936">When you complete this mechanical draft, take a few days off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17937">Do what you want, but give yourself some time to digest the changes you’ve made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17938">And then, you’ll be ready to move into the third stage, the “polish draft” of your screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17939">This is where you’ll really be writing the first draft screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17940">You’ll be polishing, accenting, and texturing each scene, changing a word here, a word there, a sentence here, a scene there, sometimes rewriting a scene up to ten or fifteen times to make it right.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17941">You’ll still be working in units of dramatic action, Act I, First Half and Second Half of Act II and Act III, but you’ll be approaching each scene with the lens of a microscope. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17942">You’ll go into each scene, analyze it, maybe cut this line, or move that line from the beginning of the scene to the end, lift one or two lines from the middle of the scene and tighten, condense, and polish the scene, word by word and line by line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17943">You may be removing or tweaking lines of description as well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17944">You want to make this “the best read” you can.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17945">One of the rules I created for myself when I was writing screenplays is that no descriptive paragraph should be more than four sentences long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17946">I know that’s an arbitrary statement, but I’ve read so many scripts that had “thick,” “dense,” “bulky” descriptive paragraphs of half or three-quarters of a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17947">You want lots of white space on the page because that’s what a professional screenplay looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17948">If you want to see what a professional screenplay looks like, get any screenplay, and read it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17949">Just Google </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17950">screenplays</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17951"> online and it will guide you to a number of sites where you can download scripts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17952">You’ll notice how the descriptive paragraphs are lean, tight, and visual without too much explanation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17953">Sometimes, you’ll find you may want to remove an entire character and give his or her lines to another character, so you don’t have so many people on the page that the text becomes confusing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17954">Oliver Stone told me once that when he wrote the first draft of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17955">Platoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17956">, he had twenty-six characters in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17957">You can’t do that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17958">You want to keep the action and character lines flowing simply and smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17959">In this polish stage, after going over a scene five or ten times to make it right, you may find that it still doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17960">As you ponder this dilemma, you’ll realize that you might have to move three lines from a scene in Act I into another scene in the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17961">Or, you might bridge one scene with another scene, and drop a nice transition because it doesn’t really work that well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17962">You may telescope scenes, meaning you take one scene from the First Half of Act II, and combine it with another scene in the Second Half of Act II, thus establishing an entirely new scene that says the same thing in a shorter time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17963">Remember the purpose of the scene: either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17964">If your scenes do not satisfy at least one of these two requirements, then cut the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17965">You don’t need it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17966">You’ll be noticing certain rhythms of action, and possibly see places where a simple “pause,” or “beat,” before a character speaks will strengthen the dramatic tension of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17967">You’ll change: “he glances at the woman sitting across from him” to “he regards her questioningly.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17968">You’ll sharpen visual images by adding adjectives, tightening and condensing dialogue by cutting words from speeches, sometimes whole sentences, occasionally chunks of dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17969">Again, work in units of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17970">First, complete Act I, then the First Half of Act II, the Second Half of Act II, then Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17971">Working in units like this allows you to control your story and move forward, step-by-step, toward the resolution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17972">Good structure, remember, is like the relationship between an ice cube and water, or fire and its heat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17973">As you’re polishing your screenplay, you’ll smooth the structural line until the incidents, episodes, or events that anchor the story line won’t even be noticeable.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17974">The key words are: tighten, trim, condense, polish, cut, cut, then cut some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17975">Most new writers don’t like to cut words—or paragraphs—but you have to be ruthless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17976">If you’re wondering whether you should keep a scene, a specific line of dialogue, a descriptive paragraph, or a sequence, chances are that you’ll cut it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17977">There is only one purpose in this third, or polish draft, and that is to make what you’ve written into the best screenplay you can.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17979">It’s a difficult question, a hard call. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17980">You’ll never really know for sure, of course, but there are certain signs to look for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17981">First of all, understand that your script will never be perfect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17982">There will always be a few scenes that don’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17983">No matter how many times you write or rewrite a certain scene, it may never be the way you want it to be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17984">Sometimes, you’ll just have to let those scenes go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17985">No one will ever notice that they don’t work or measure up to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17986">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17987"> expectations.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17988">You might also find that you’re spending a lot of time on minor changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17989">You may change “but there are signs,” to “and there are signs.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17990">That’s a sure sign that you’re ready to stop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17991">That’s when you can lay down your pages and say, “It’s done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17992">I’ve completed the first draft of my screenplay.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17993">That’s when you can let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17994">It will either stand or fall on its own.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17995">At this point, I might suggest that you give your first draft to one or two people </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17996">you trust</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17997">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17998">Personally, I would not suggest giving your script to your loved ones, or significant other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17999">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18000">Because out of their love, kindness, and friendship for you, they’ll want to be as “honest” as they can; after all, you’re putting your trust in them to let them read and evaluate your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18001">So, out of their love for you, they’ll be ruthless; they’ll tell you that this character is dull, flat, or the premise doesn’t work and the dialogue is thin and weak. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18002">All your worst fears will be realized when you ask your loved ones to comment and critique your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18003">You’ve got to trust me on this one.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18004">For example, in one of my screenwriting classes, I had a woman who was blessed with a wonderful sense of humor and a naturally wacky and unique style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18005">She had never written a screenplay before but had an idea she wanted to write into a comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18006">So, she came to class and went through the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18007">She laid out her subject line, developed her characters, and then wrote the four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18008">Then, feeling insecure about what she had written, she gave it to her husband to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18009">Now, her husband happened to be a very gifted film composer who had worked in Hollywood for years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18010">He read her treatment and out of the “goodness of his heart, out of love for his wife,” he wanted to be totally honest with her.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18011">And guess what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18012">In the name of love, he literally crucified her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18013">Your characters are weak, he told her; the plot is mundane; no one would ever believe the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18014">And you know, in his mind, he thought he was doing the right thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18015">He really wanted to protect her from the harsh realities of Hollywood and didn’t want her to get hurt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18016">She listened politely to what he had to say, then took the treatment, put it in a drawer somewhere and never looked at it again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18017">To this day, she has never picked up that story line or sat down at the computer to make another attempt at writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18018">And, it was a good story that had a lot of potential.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18019">From that experience, I tell people not to give their material to a loved one, or spouse, or significant other for feedback; just know that out of their love and affection for you, they’ll confirm your worst fears. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18020">Or, they’ll tell you how much they like it and you don’t know whether it’s the truth or a lie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18021">We’re all so insecure anyway we never really, truly know whether what we wrote is working or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18022">And you don’t want anybody telling you what you already know.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18023">Especially in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18024">Most of the time nobody tells you the truth anyway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18025">They might say something like, “I like it but it’s not really something we want to do at the present time,” or, “we have something like this in development,” or “we’ve already done that movie.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18026">That’s not going to help you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18027">You want some feedback; you want someone to tell you what he or she really thinks about your script, in terms of what’s working or not, so choose the people you give this first draft to very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18028">After they’ve read it, listen to what they say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18029">Don’t defend what you’ve written, don’t </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18030">pretend</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18031"> to listen to what they say and then leave feeling righteous, indignant, or hurt.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18032">See whether they’ve caught the “intention” of what you wanted to write about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18033">Listen to their observations from the point of view that they just </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18034">might be right</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18035">, not that they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18036">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18037"> right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18038">They’ll have observations, criticisms, suggestions, opinions, and judgments. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18039">Are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18040"> they right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18041">Question them; press them on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18042">Do their suggestions or ideas make sense? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18043">Do they add to your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18044">Enhance it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18045">Or, didn’t they get it?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18046">Go over the story with them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18047">Find out what they like and dislike, what works for them and what doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18048">At this point, you still can’t see your screenplay objectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18049">If you want another opinion, “just in case,” be prepared to get confused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18050">If you give it to four people for example, they’ll all disagree. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18051">One person will like the relationship, another won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18052">One person will say they like the robbery, but not the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18053">result</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18054"> of the holdup (they either get away or they don’t); and the other one wonders whether you couldn’t strengthen the relationship between the other characters.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18055">Having too many people read your material just doesn’t work—at least, not at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18056">You want initial feedback from two people you know you can trust, who will be totally honest with you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18057">When you’ve made all the changes you think will make the screenplay better, then you can send it out into the world through a literary agent, or producer, or production company, or attorney, or anyone you can get it to.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18058">It’s either going to stand or fall on its own. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18059">It’s not going to be “perfect.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18063">Are you ready? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18064">Let’s do it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18065">First, sit down and read the words-on-paper draft from beginning to end in one sitting; take no notes, just sit down and read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18066">You’ll be on a roller coaster of emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18067">Don’t fight it, don’t deny it, and don’t try to “reason” things out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18068">Just keep reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18069">You’ll be making changes in your head, and that’s okay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18070">You’ll swing between despair and elation, so enjoy the ride. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18071">When you’ve finished reading, take a day or two to digest your experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18072">Then, using free-association, write the three essays in a couple of pages each. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18073">The first essay you’re writing answers the question: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18074">What was it that originally attracted you to the idea?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18075"> Just throw down words, thoughts, and feelings as you recall your first spark of inspiration and why you wanted to write the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18076">Don’t judge or evaluate your answer; just throw it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18077">You want clarity and insight here, so you don’t have to worry about grammar, spelling, or the correct sentence structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18078">This is only an exercise for you, no one else.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18079">When you’ve completed this first essay, write the second essay: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18080">What kind of story did you end up writing?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18081"> You may have wanted to write an action-thriller but you ended up writing a romantic thriller. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18082">Define and articulate </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18083">what kind of a story you ended up writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18084">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18085">Do this in a couple of pages of free-association. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18086">Just throw down your thoughts, words and ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18087">Don’t limit or censor yourself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18088">When you’ve completed the second essay, write the third essay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18089">Answer the third question in a couple of pages: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18090">What do I have to do to change what I did do, into what I originally wanted to do?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18091"> As mentioned, what you ended up doing may be a better script than what you originally wanted to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18092">So what do you have to do to change it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18093">You may need to set up the characters more forcefully, or strengthen the relationships, or open it up visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18094">This is an exercise that clarifies what you need to do make your script a good read.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18095">After you’ve answered the three questions you’re ready to move into the actual writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18096">Start with Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18097">Read it as a unit of dramatic action and take notes, either in the margin or on a separate piece of paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18098">Structure and correlate any new scenes with the old scenes written, and then, if need be, lay out your new Act I structure on fourteen 3 × 5 cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18099">Go over the cards until the flow of action feels comfortable to you, then begin writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18100">Your first few pages may be stilted and awkward; it’s okay, don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18101">This is only the “mechanical draft.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18102">You may be changing anywhere from 80 to 85 percent of your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18103">Don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18104">Just do it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18105">Work in units of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18106">The whole process of rewriting this first act could take a week or two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18107">Don’t worry if your work feels stilted, or episodic; just lay out your story line focusing on the threads of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18108">Then move into the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18109">Read this unit of dramatic action, make notes in the margins, and, if need be, restructure it on 3 × 5 cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18110">Then, start rewriting, one scene at a time, one page at a time, through Pinch I to the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18111">You may be changing 50 to 60 percent of the material in this unit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18112">Be clear on your sub-dramatic context, and what you need to do to smooth out the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18113">As you write the Mid-Point, be sure the focus of your story is clear and defined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18114">Then move into the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18115">Use the same process; read the material, take notes, structure it on 3 × 5 cards if needed, then start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18116">In this unit of action, you’ll only need to change about 40 to 50 percent of the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18117">Just change what you need to change; don’t worry about rhythm, tension, or transitions in this “mechanical” stage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18118">Move into Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18119">Bring it to length, and make all the changes needed for a consistent story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18120">Check your ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18121">Does it work as effectively as you want it to? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18122">Or, do you need to modify it somewhat, perhaps even change it radically? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18123">What’s important is that it works; do what you need to do to make it the best ending you can.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18124">When you’ve completed this “mechanical” stage of the screenplay, move into the “polish” stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18125">Again, work in thirty-page units of dramatic action; polish, hone, clean, tighten, accent, cut, and shade your material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18126">Your name is on the title page, so do the best job you can.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18127">Remember, a screenplay is a reading experience before it becomes a film experience.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18149">I am always looking for the “good read.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18150">What is a “good read”? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18151">I don’t know how to define it exactly, I can only say that it is a dynamic reading experience that hits me with a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18152">visual style</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18153"> that unfolds in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18154">It “looks” a certain way, it “reads” a certain way, and it “feels” a certain way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18155">A good screenplay works from page one, word one. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18156">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18157"> is a good read; so are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18158">The Shawshank Redemption, The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18159">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18160">The Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18161">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18162">What attracts me immediately is the way the words are put down on paper: crisp, sparse, and visual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18163">I can tell whether the story is set up in the first few paragraphs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18164">Does it open with a dynamic inciting incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18165">Does it grab my attention? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18166">Are the characters appealing, well-rounded, and three-dimensional? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18167">Is the premise and situation set up with insight and clarity in the first ten pages? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18168">Is there enough information presented to captivate me so I want to continue reading? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18169">Or is the story cluttered with too many characters, dense plots, and subplots?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18170">When I find a “good read,” I know it; there’s a certain excitement and energy that grabs me immediately, from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18171">What I’m looking for is a writing style that moves the action across the page like lightning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18172">Where I can’t help but keep turning pages, which, of course, is the screenwriter’s function—to keep the reader turning pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18173">And this, believe it or not, is the contradiction: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18174">nobody likes to read in Hollywood, yet everybody loves to read a good screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18175">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18176">That’s just the way it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18177">Things never change in that respect.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18178">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18179">Because there are so many poorly written screenplays; perhaps one out of a thousand is worthy of moving up to the next level of the executive chain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18180">And when you find a “good read” everyone wants to read it, so it is faxed and emailed to development executives all over Hollywood.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18181">So, what does the reader look for when he or she is evaluating the material? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18182">Several things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18183">I thought it would be interesting to illustrate the reader’s process when he or she is given a script to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18184">Every screenplay submitted goes through this same journey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18185">If you are submitting a script to a studio or production company, this is what most likely will happen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18186">When the material is submitted, either by an authorized literary agent, or attorney, or producer, or director, it’s given to a reader to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18187">(Unsolicited material is usually returned unread due to various legal issues.) The reader reads the script, then he or she writes up a short, detailed synopsis and offers his or her personal opinion of the material in a couple of pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18188">This is referred to as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18189">coverage</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18190">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18191">Coverage is a tool for the film executive who doesn’t read the material but has to respond to the person who submitted it, either agents or producers or directors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18192">Coverage includes the name of the writer, the particular genre, a logline (a brief, one-sentence description of the story), and various checkpoints on a chart which indicate the reader’s judgment regarding the quality of material in terms of structure, character, story, dialogue, and overall writing ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18193">It is broken down in terms of: excellent, good, fair, and poor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18194">I’ve taken the liberty of summarizing a reader’s evaluation from a major film company and it’s a pretty good reflection of what the reader looks for when assessing the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18195">In this example, I’ve avoided using any names and titles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18196">First, in the upper left-hand corner, there is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18197">title</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18198">, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18199">author</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18200">, and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18201">genre</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18202">, a one-word description of the type of story: action-adventure, love story, western, comedy, romantic comedy, farce, romance, drama, science fiction, animated, or futuristic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18203">In this particular example, the genre is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18204">romance with sad ending</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18205">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18206">Second, there is a brief summary of the story, a logline, a four- or five-line description of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18207">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18208"> the story is about; in this instance the synopsis reads: “A beautiful, ambitious young attorney schemes to get ahead in a Chicago-based law firm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18209">Her boss, married with three kids, falls in love with her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18210">She subtly demands to be made a full partner, which ruins him politically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18211">His marriage on the rocks, he leaves to start his own firm, making her a partner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18212">Within weeks, he’s begging his wife to take him back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18213">Our girl steams ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18214">That’s what the story is about; it is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18215">subject</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18216"> of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18217">(If you want to read good loglines, read the movie synopses in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18218">TV Guide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18219">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18220">It’s a good example of the way you need to “pitch” your story line.)</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18221">Third, after the logline, there is a one-and-a-half page detailed synopsis of the story, in depth and detail, which I have omitted.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18275">Today, more people are writing screenplays than ever before and the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking has become an integral part of our society and culture. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18276">Last year some seventy-five thousand screenplays and teleplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18277">Out of all these, some four hundred and fifty films were produced, either in Hollywood as major studio productions, or by various independent film companies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18278">You do the math.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18279">Within the next few years, the number of people writing for the visual media will probably double and triple in size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18280">And it’s only going to expand exponentially as the evolution/revolution of technology impacts the world and the way we see things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18281">It seems this is the only time in human history where we have created a technology which our children are teaching </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18282">us</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18283"> how to use.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18294">The marketplace for the screenwriter is changing drastically and the need for new directions in terms of visual storytelling is in its infancy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18295">Right now, television programming is being made and distributed specifically for our cell phones and iPods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18296">Already, companies are looking to produce specialized material for the vast number of markets that will be available.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18297">The vast constellation of Hollywood production companies is also changing to fit the needs of these new technologies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18298">It won’t be too long before the entire motion picture and television market will be something other than what it is today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18299">No one knows exactly what this market will be, domestic or international, but one thing is certain: the opportunities for the screenwriter and visual storytelling will be enormous.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18453">When I first started thinking about writing this book, I wanted to find some kind of tool that the screenwriter could use in order to recognize and define various problems of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18454">But as I began writing, I became aware that I was really writing about the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18455">solutions</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18456"> to various problems, and not really identifying them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18457">It just didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18458">So I began to rethink my approach. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18459">To solve any kind of a problem means you have to be able to recognize it, identify it, and then define it; only in that way can any problem really be solved.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18460">The more I began thinking about the “problem,” the more it became clear that most screenwriters don’t know exactly what the problem really is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18461">There’s a vague and somewhat tenuous feeling somewhere that something is not working; either the plot is too thin or too thick; or the character is too strong or too weak; or there’s not enough action, or the character disappears off the page, or the story is told all in dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18462">So I began analyzing the Problem-Solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18463">The only way I could make this book work, I realized, was to recognize and define the various </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18464">symptoms</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18465"> of the problem, very much the way a medical doctor isolates the various symptoms of his patients before he can treat the disease.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18466">When I approached the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18467">Problem-Solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18468"> process from this point of view (and it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18469">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18470"> a process), I began to see that there’s usually not just </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18471">one</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18472"> symptom, but </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18473">many</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18474"> symptoms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18475">It soon became clear that many of the problems in screenwriting share the same symptoms, but the problems themselves are different in kind; only when you analyze the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18476">context of the problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18477"> can a distinction be made, and it is those distinctions that lead us on the path of recognizing, defining, and solving. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18478">For the truth is that you can’t solve a problem until you know what it is.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18479">With that in mind I began to understand that there are only three distinct categories of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18480">The Problem;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18481"> when you’re writing a screenplay, all problems spring either from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18482">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18483">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18484">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18485">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18486">The art of Problem Solving is really the art of recognition</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18487">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18488">You can look at any problem in two ways: the first is to accept the fact that a problem is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18489">something that doesn’t work</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18490">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18491">If that’s the case, you can avoid it, deny it, and pretend it doesn’t exist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18492">That’s the easy way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18493">But there’s another way of approaching the problem, and that’s to look at any creative problem as a challenge, an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18494">opportunity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18495"> for you to expand your screenwriting skills.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18496">They are really both sides of the same coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18497">How you look at it is up to you.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18501">A few weeks ago, during one of my screenwriting workshops, a student turned in some pages from her screenplay with a somewhat worried and concerned expression on her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18502">I didn’t say anything, I simply took the pages and read them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18503">The scene she had written took place at the beginning of the Second Act, as the main character, a lawyer, is investigating the mysterious and unexpected death of her mother, who had died while recovering from a simple surgical procedure in the hospital.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18504">Stunned and grieving, she is trying to find out why her mother had suddenly died, but no one has any answers, and no one is talking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18505">The doctors placate her, the nurses know nothing, and the hospital administrator is concerned and suggests she join a grieving group. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18506">Her grief turns to anger, and she’s determined to find out what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18507">Pursuing lead after lead, she manages to locate one of the nurses who had taken care of her mother right before she died. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18508">The nurse had mysteriously quit the hospital a few days after the mother’s death, had changed her address and literally disappeared. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18509">But through her own persistence, and some lawyer friends, she manages to track the nurse down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18510">And now, she’s going to talk to her.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18511">This was the scene my student had just written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18512">As I read her pages, I began to get some insight into why she appeared to be concerned about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18513">She had written the scene like an interrogation; the main character questions the nurse, who is reluctant to say anything about her mother’s death.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18514">This was an important scene, and it had to be handled in such a way that it both moved the story forward and revealed information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18515">She’s tough, feisty, and smart, and she’s not just going to accept what happened, but she’s determined to find out why it happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18516">And this scene is the first real clue the main character has which confirms her suspicion that some kind of cover-up is going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18517">Somebody made a mistake here, and because of it, her mother is dead.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18518">I waited until the people in the class had finished reading the pages, then I turned to the young woman who had written the scene, and asked, “What do you think?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18519">She was very quick to answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18520">“I think something’s wrong,” she said, “it just doesn’t feel right.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18521">She was right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18522">She had a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18523">problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18524">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18525">Problems are common in screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18526">The old expression “Writing is rewriting” is very true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18527">But in my experience there are two ways you can look at a problem:</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18528">The first is to say that a problem is something that doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18529">Very simple.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18530">The second way is to say that a problem is an opportunity, a challenge that will allow you to ultimately improve your craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18531">Two different points of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18532">But any way you look at it is the same: a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18533">problem becomes the fuel of creativity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18534">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18535">You either view it as an obstacle or an opportunity; either a problem is something that doesn’t work, or an opportunity for you to move up to another level.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18537">For some people the simple knowledge that they have a problem in their script can create a panic attack; it’s a horrible, much-to-be-dreaded experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18538">I have traveled all over the world conducting screenwriting seminars and workshops, and I hear the same thing in country after country; screenwriters describe their scripts in terms of the problems they are encountering. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18539">“Well,” they say, “my problem is that my structure’s not working,” or “my character’s weak,” or “the dialogue’s flat.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18540">And I tell them there are no problems, there are only solutions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18541">They laugh at that, because they think I’m kidding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18542">But I’m not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18543">I think what scares most screenwriters, or anyone for that matter, is that most of the time they know there’s a problem, they just don’t know what it is. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18544">They can’t define or describe it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18545">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18546">It exists only as a vague sense of discomfort, an imprecise dissatisfaction, a knot in the gut or a lump in the throat.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18547">My student knew, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18548">or felt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18549">, she had a problem with these pages, she just didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18550">The art of Problem Solving means being aware of those hazy and undefined feelings, and using them as some kind of a guide to lead you into an examination of the cause or source of the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18551">The art of Problem Solving is really </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18552">the art of recognition</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18553">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18554">In my student’s case the main character, the lawyer, has knocked and entered, and she and the nurse have a dialogue scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18555">The scene was smooth and well written, but the overall effect was really somewhat dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18556">Basically, talking heads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18557">That’s not screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18558">That’s playwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18559">There was no sense of threat, no tension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18560">And when I read pages that are slow and boring, the first thing I do is look for the source of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18561">And in these pages there was hardly any conflict at all.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18562">I wanted to find out what her feelings were about the scene, so I looked at her for a long moment, and then asked, “What do you think?”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18564">“Like what?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18565">I said, wanting to get specific.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18568">“So what do you think it is?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18569">I persisted.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18570">She thought about it for a moment, then said, “I think it’s soft; it feels fuzzy.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18571">Soft and fuzzy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18572">That’s a pretty accurate description. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18573">It lets you know that something’s not working as well as you think it should. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18574">And if you don’t pay attention to that little “itch,” that little “soft and fuzzy” feeling, the chances are it could evolve into a much larger </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18575">problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18576"> later on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18577">Writing a screenplay is such a specific and demanding craft that when something doesn’t work, whether a scene, or sequence, or character, it casts a long shadow across the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18578">It becomes the seed that will erupt into a full-blown problem later on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18579">So it’s important to catch and take note of these </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18580">symptoms</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18581"> as they occur.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18588">When you get down to it, the art of Problem Solving is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18589">art of recognition</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18590">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18591">And it is a definite skill that relies on the writer’s sense of recognition and self-awareness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18592">If you feel there’s a problem—maybe the script is too long, too talky, or the characters are too weak or too thin—what can you do to fix it?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18593">Nothing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18594">At least not until you can accurately describe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18595">Until you know what the problem is, all you can do is piddle around with it; you can’t fix something until you know what’s wrong with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18596">There are many screenwriters who piddle around with a problem without fixing it, and it will probably remain as one of those scenes that never seem to work, no matter what you do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18597">And you just let it go and hope no one notices it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18598">It happens all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18599">The ostrich syndrome.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18600">But if you know how to define and articulate the problem—maybe the main character is too passive and seemingly disappears from the action, or is too unsympathetic, or maybe the dialogue’s too direct—you’ve got a handle on it and you can solve it to the best of your ability.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18601">So, in this process of what we call Problem Solving, how do we go about fixing “soft and fuzzy”?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18602">First, define the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18603">That means generally rethinking the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18604">Go back into the material; analyze your </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18605">intentions</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18606">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18607">What is the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18608">Why is it there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18609">What is the character’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18610">dramatic need</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18611">—what does your main character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18612">It’s usually something that can be described fairly simply; in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18613">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18614"> (Callie Khouri) it is their need to escape safely to Mexico. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18615">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18616">Dances With Wolves</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18617"> it is John Dunbar’s dramatic need to go to the farthermost edge of the frontier and adapt to the ways of the land and the people.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18618">So, what is your character’s dramatic need? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18619">Define it within the context of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18620">If you can illuminate this dramatic need—either through action or dialogue—you gain more subtext and texture, and thus add more dimension to the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18621">The first step in Problem Solving means to rethink the needs of a scene; you must take it apart in order to isolate and define the emotional forces working on, and within, the dynamic of the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18622">The scene is the living cell, the hub of dramatic action, and serves two basic functions in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18623">One, the scene moves the story forward; or, two, reveals information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18624">These two elements of story and character must be served in each and every scene, visually, if possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18625">Look at any scene in any screenplay, study any movie, and see whether this is true or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18626">It’s very common to read the pages of a screenplay and find pages and pages of extraneous scenes devoted to incidents or encounters that have absolutely nothing to do with the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18627">By definition, a screenplay is a story told in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18628">pictures</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18629">, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18630">This is something I never get tired of repeating, because for some reason we always seem to forget it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18631">Each scene always has to move the narrative line forward, from beginning to end, beginning to end, even though it’s not necessarily in that order, as illustrated by </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18632">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18633"> (Quentin Tarantino), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18634">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18635"> (Patrick Shane Duncan), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18636">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18637"> (Anthony Minghella, beautifully adapted from the book by Michael Ondaatje).</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18638">The scene my student wrote, which she could only describe as being “soft and fuzzy,” is really a key scene that moves the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18639">But the way she wrote it was not sharp enough; the dialogue was too nice, too direct; there was no tension, no subtext working, and it washed out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18640">There was not enough definition or dimension in it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18641">So I had her redefine the character’s dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18642">In this particular scene the character’s dramatic need is to find out any information she can about her mother’s sudden and mysterious death. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18643">Was there any wrongdoing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18644">A mistake of some kind? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18645">Why did the nurse suddenly quit and leave the hospital? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18646">Is there a cover-up going on? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18647">What’s happening here?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18648">These are all important questions within the context of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18649">And context, remember, is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18650">space that holds something in place</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18651">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18652">It is the space inside the glass that holds the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18653">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18654">—water, coffee, tea, milk, beer, soft drink, grapes, nuts or raisins, whatever—in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18655">The space inside the glass does not change: it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18656">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18657"> the content together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18658">It is the gravity of the scene; it is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18659">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18660">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18661">I knew my student had to make the scene sharper, more defined, with more tension, and the only way to do that was by generating more conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18662">So I made some suggestions: maybe the nurse is not at home when the main character arrives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18663">Maybe the first thing she has to do is wait. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18664">Maybe in her car. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18665">Maybe a couple of hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18666">This provides a back story to the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18667">It lets the character enter the scene with some built-in tension.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18668">So let’s add some more conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18669">The main character has had to wait a couple of hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18670">So what else can we do to create conflict in the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18671">What if the nurse has a boyfriend, and maybe the guy’s not too bright and he lets the main character, the lawyer, into the apartment before the nurse arrives home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18672">He assumes they’re friends. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18673">So she could already be in the house when the nurse arrives home.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18674">These elements would add a great deal of conflict to the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18675">The nurse arrives home, she’s pissed at her boyfriend for letting a stranger, the lawyer, in, and we can see by her defiance and attitude that she’s frightened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18676">For sure this woman knows what happened to the character’s mother and does not want to say anything about it, for whatever reason. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18677">Maybe she’s even preparing to leave town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18678">But she’s tough and doesn’t want to give anything away.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18679">What does that do to the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18680">Obviously, it sharpens the dramatic forces within it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18681">What had been soft now shows more potential for tension and conflict; there’s an edge to it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18682">And there’s a way to get even more out of the scene; throughout this book I’m going to be referring to the value of writing short essays about your story and characters, defining and expanding events and relationships. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18683">Even though the nurse is a minor character, she is important to the story, and therefore becomes an important scene in the story development and cannot be “fuzzy” in its execution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18684">I suggested that she sketch in the nurse’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18685">What exactly did she see in the hospital? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18686">How much does she know? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18687">What actually happened? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18688">I told her to create a step-by-step series of events from the nurse’s point of view that led up to the death of the lawyer’s mother.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18689">Once that was done, I had her define the relationship between the nurse and her “boyfriend.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18690">There might be more subtext that could be mined for maximum dramatic value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18691">So I had my student write a short </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18692">free-association essay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18693"> about their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18694">Simply to sharpen the elements of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18695">Where did the nurse meet him, how long have they been together, is it a serious relationship? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18696">Or maybe it’s over; maybe they’re getting ready to separate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18697">The answers to these questions allow you to expand the dynamic forces working from within and without the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18698">These are steps that need to be taken so the dramatic elements that are necessary to drive the story forward can be heightened and defined.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18699">She went back to the “drawing board,” did the exercises I suggested, and began to see things from a different perspective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18700">She created more possibilities for her screenplay by simply listening to her feelings of discomfort about what was wrong with these pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18701">Throughout the cycles of history and literature, there have always been attempts to define the art and craft of writing, about what it is and how it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18702">To me, writing is all about asking questions and then waiting for the answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18703">The answers will always be there and in most cases will reveal themselves in a totally unexpected way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18704">That’s part of the wonder of the writing process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18705">Aided by these written exercises, my student was able to go deeper into the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18706">She began to see it differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18707">She </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18708">saw</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18709">, for example, that when she first wrote the scene the interaction of her characters was vague and hazy, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18710">soft</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18711">, and clarified that by redefining the dramatic need of the main character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18712">“What is character but the determination of incident?”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18713"> Henry James, the great American novelist, wrote. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18714">“And what is incident but the illumination of character?”</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18715">So let’s take this to another level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18716">We all know that drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18717">Without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story; and without story you have no screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18718">You only have a succession of incidents and events that flows to its conclusion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18719">It looks like a story, it acts like a story, but there’s really nothing there but a bunch of hooks, gimmicks, or special effects.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18728">I wanted my student to sharpen her dramatic focus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18729">In order to understand the forces of conflict working on the nurse in this scene, I suggested she do another exercise; that she write the scene from the nurse’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18730">In other words, if this story was about the nurse, if she was the main character, how would </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18731">she</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18732"> react if she knew something about the incident, something she didn’t want to reveal to anyone, and then the victim’s daughter came snooping around, trying to find out information about what happened?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18733">Changing the perspective of the scene like this, merely as an exercise, helps clarify and sharpen the character’s point of view, and thus brings the dramatic conflict into bold relief.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18734">That’s what she did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18735">And it opened up a whole new awareness in her writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18736">The rewritten scene became clean, sharp, and tight; there was subtext and context and it moved the story forward in a charged and highly dramatic fashion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18737">And it all started from her discomfort, from a little tug in her gut and her awareness that the scene was “soft and fuzzy.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18756">Before you can solve any creative problem you’ve got to know what the problem is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18757">And that means you’ve got to rethink and possibly reorganize whatever it is that needs to be fixed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18758">That means literally rewriting it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18759">You’ve all heard the old expression “Writing is rewriting.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18760">Well, it’s true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18761">I tell that to writers all over the world and they panic: “You mean I’ve got to rewrite it?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18762">they moan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18763">The answer is yes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18764">Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18765">Sorry.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18766">I’ve just been working with one of my students preparing a screenplay to submit to directors and actors, and he’s gone through at least fifteen rewrites. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18767">He had to change almost the entire Second Half of Act II, altering subplots, removing some characters, and taking out a lot of fat that was really unnecessary to the story line.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18776">There are times when you know what it is immediately, maybe the scene’s too talky, or too “preachy,” too specific or direct, but while you may know what it is, you don’t really know enough about it to fix it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18777">That’s where the process of rewriting comes in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18778">The first thing you need to do to clarify and define the problem is to put it into a context, a window, so you can outline the parameters of whatever it is that’s not working, whether it be a character, scene, or sequence.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18779">The best way to do that is to do a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18780">written exercise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18781">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18782">Sit down, take a piece of paper, or go to the computer, and in a couple of pages just throw down any thoughts or ideas you have about the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18783">Free-associate; ask yourself the question “What is the problem I am looking for?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18784">It’s important to remember to begin each question with the word </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18785">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18786">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18787">Try to phrase the question in such a way that it begins with the word </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18788">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18789">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18790">Not </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18791">why</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18792">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18793">If you ask “why” something is not working, you’ll get eighteen different answers and they’ll all be correct.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18823">I firmly believe that if you created the problem, you can solve it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18824">Therefore, you have to look inside yourself for the answers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18825">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18826">Problems only exist so they can be solved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18827">It doesn’t really matter how you do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18828">The solution could come to you in a dream, or while driving the car, running in the park, or even cooking dinner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18829">The answer will be there when you least expect it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18830">All you have to do is look for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18831">Trust yourself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18832">Let the answer come in its own time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18833">Sometimes the answer comes easily, and sometimes not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18834">That’s the wonderful thing about it; you never really know when you’ll get a solution, or what it’ll be; just know you’ll get it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18835">Problem Solving is part of the creative process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18836">So what’s the problem? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18837">Read over the pages you think are not working and see if you can isolate or define the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18838">Maybe your story doesn’t follow one line of action, but goes off in several different directions at once. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18839">Or maybe too many things are happening to your main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18840">For example, your main character may be a cop, but you think you should show more about his partner, so you write some scenes about his partner, and pretty soon you’ll find you’ve created an entire subplot that gets in the way of the story; or maybe you want to show the bad guy being “badder,” so you keep adding scenes showing just how bad he is; that happened in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18841">Die Hard With a Vengeance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18842">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18843">It’s an easy way to “fill” the story but only succeeds in getting in the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18844">By spending so much time with other characters, you’ll ultimately end up losing your main character and your story will probably end up going all over the place, in several directions simultaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18845">The real problem is losing the focus on the main character, and that’s who your story is really about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18846">Sometimes, when screenwriters don’t know what to do next, or what happens next, they’ll simply add a new character to the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18847">Rather than working to develop the dramatic context of the scene, story, or character, or expanding the action, all they do is add a new character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18848">But that won’t work because it’s really a problem of developing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18849">story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18850">, not character, although one always reflects and incorporates the other.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18851">Or maybe you read your pages and decide that you have too many characters in the story, or that your main character is too passive, too reactive, and seems to disappear into the background while a minor character pops up and takes over the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18852">What is your story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18853">And who is your story about?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18854"> That’s what always has to be kept in mind.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18855">So, do this little exercise where you free-associate about what the problem is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18856">It’s important to remember that when you do it, you’re rereading pages with the awareness that you’re looking for something that’s not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18857">Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas in free association; you don’t have to worry about grammar or spelling (nobody’s going to see this but you), so just throw it down without regard to how good or how bad it is, or whether it’s right or wrong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18858">Don’t make any judgments about your writing or what comes up; your judgments tend to censor and smother your creativity if you listen too closely.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18859">So what are you looking for?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18860">There are only three things you can be looking for: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18861">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18862">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18863">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18864">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18865">Those are the only three areas where you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18866">can</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18867"> have a problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18868">The entire story can be broken down into these three areas, and they become the hub, or means, of the Problem-Solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18869">If you look at any problem in the screenplay—whether the script is too long and talky, or there’s too much action and not enough character, or too much character and not enough action—whatever the problem, everything falls under the umbrella of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18870">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18871">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18872">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18873">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18874">So, what’s the problem?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18882">That’s the starting point in defining any problem areas in a screenplay—or all writing, for that matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18883">What is it that’s not working? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18884">If a scene is not working, is it because of a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18885">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18886">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18887">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18888">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18889">Is the material boring? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18890">Too talky? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18891">Does the scene, or action, move the story forward, or does it reveal information about the character?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18892">If the line of action wanders too far from the story, a solution might be to add elements that keep the story anchored and moving forward; so that’s an element of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18893">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18894">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18895">But in altering the plot you’ll also find yourself forced to restructure the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18896">Changes to the plot and structure will affect your character’s actions and reactions, requiring more adjustment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18897">And that’s how you’ll fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18898">All three areas will always be related to one another; only the approach differs.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19000">Which brings us to an overview discussion of screenplay structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19001">A screenplay is a unique form; it is neither novel nor play, but combines elements of both. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19002">Structure is the foundation of all screenwriting, the spine or skeleton that “holds” everything together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19003">William Goldman (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19004">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Marathon Man, Maverick</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19005">) declares that “a screenplay is structure,” and it’s true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19006">Structure is the gravity of story, the road map through the desert. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19007">It is both guide and support, and flexibility is its nature, for structure is like a tree in the wind that bends but doesn’t break. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19008">The structural elements of a screenplay can be moved around and through the dramatic story line.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19010">The word itself means “to build, or to put together,” and “the relationship between the parts and the whole.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19011">If you’re building a story through action, characters, and events, those elements have to be structured into a definite beginning, middle, or end, though not always in that particular order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19012">And each of those units, the beginning, the middle, and the end, is part of the story, part of the dramatic (or comedic) story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19013">It’s the story that forms structure; structure doesn’t form the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19014">When you’re developing a screenplay, and building and putting it together into a series of related incidents, episodes, or events, it should be leading you to the dramatic resolution, the solution of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19015">First you build it, then you structure it into its component parts, beginning, middle, and end, and it’s the relationship between the parts and the whole that make it an organic whole.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19264">As you’re reading the screenplay, you’ll notice some emotional shifts; you’ll read a scene and wonder how could anybody write this drivel; or you’ll think it the worst thing you’ve ever read, or see the incidents and events of the story as so outlandish that nobody would believe them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19265">You’ll feel totally depressed; just keep on reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19266">Then you’ll read a scene you’ve written and think it’s really not too bad, and then there’s a scene that really works well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19267">Certain scenes you’ll suddenly be aware of are way too long and talky, but you know they can be cut and trimmed, and you’ll swing on the pendulum of emotion between elation and despair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19268">You’ll simply experience a roller coaster of emotion as you read through the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19269">When you finish your reading, take some time to think about the screenplay; contemplate your overall feelings about the story, the characters, and the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19270">As you begin to “cruise” through the progression of your story from beginning to end, you’ll balance yourself out and start to move into an overview position to see the relationships between the parts and the whole, the relationships that exist between Act I, Act II, and Act III.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19271">Think about what you’ve read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19272">Is the story set up correctly? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19273">What about the relationships between the characters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19274">Are they believable? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19275">Do the characters talk too much, explain too much? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19276">What about the conflicts and obstacles in Act II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19277">Does the ending work?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19280">Think about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19281">Just go through the story from beginning to end in terms of the action and the characters.</span></p>

				Since the context of Act I is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19376">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19377">, how are you setting up the story in terms of character and action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19378">Is your script action driven, or character driven? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19379">If you’re opening with an action scene, does it fully realize its dramatic function? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19380">What kind of sequence is it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19381">A murder sequence, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19382">Jade</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19383"> (Joe Eszterhas), or a character-driven scene or sequence, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19384">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19385">, or a combination of both action and character, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19386">Apollo 13?</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19387">If you’ve located the problem in the first ten pages, you may need to rethink and redesign this first ten-page unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19388">It’s here that you introduce your main character, state the dramatic premise, and establish the dramatic situation, the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19389">Is the action strong enough, and the character revealed? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19390">How? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19391">Through an action or dialogue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19392">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19393">Dances With Wolves</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19394"> Michael Blake shows John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) stretched out on a table ready to have his leg amputated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19395">But Dunbar, revealing an enormous sense of strength and courage, manages to force his way through the intense pain and pull on his boot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19396">This one simple action, with minimum dialogue, shows us the very qualities of his character (strength and determination) that guide Dunbar’s journey of discovery and lead to his transformation on the frontier. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19397">We see his character through his behavior, and as mentioned before, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19398">film is behavior</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19399">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19400">As will be stressed throughout this book, everything is related to everything else in a screenplay; if you have to open up and redefine or restructure the story line and premise in these first ten pages, then you have to know that whatever changes you make, like sharpening and tightening the action or dialogue, will affect and change something else in another part of the script.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19401">For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction is Newton’s Third Law of Motion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19402">Whether your story is about a person caught in a web of extraordinary circumstances, or whether you’re dramatizing an interior struggle, your character will be engaged in an emotional journey culminating in some kind of change in his or her thinking or behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19403">You may feel your character needs to be better illuminated, so then you may find it essential to go back into your character biographies to define and redefine his/her relationships.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19404">You must take the time to set up the foundations of your story line through the action and the characters in this unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19405">If you feel the material in Act I is too slow, or not visual enough, check your physical location. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19406">Is there a strong visual arena? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19407">Are your characters talking, or explaining, more than necessary? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19408">Too much dialogue always slows the action down except when the story and situation play against each other, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19409">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19410">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19411">Samuel L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19412">Jackson is always spouting from the Bible in a way that is somewhat humorous, but then we learn he’s a professional killer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19413">And he can quote from the Bible and pull the trigger in the same breath. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19414">And it’s this contradiction of character that makes the screenplay so effective and why Tarantino is such a gifted filmmaker.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19415">If your problem is in the second ten pages, and you are following focus on the main character, do these pages show his or her relationships in a way that moves the story toward Plot Point I?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19416">If you feel that the relationships are thin, or you introduce another character or characters, you may have to redefine those relationships by writing a one- or two-page essay on each character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19417">This exercise allows you to bring a greater depth of character to the screenplay and establish stronger relationships between characters, because you now know these characters with a new and deeper understanding, “see” them in a new light.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19418">Maybe you want to create two lines of visual action by intercutting a new character with the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19419">When you have two lines of dramatic action operating simultaneously, this could possibly weaken the thrust of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19420">Just follow the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19421">If that’s the case, and the action is too weak for this opening unit of dramatic action, then you may have to cut out the other character and focus the action on the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19422">Your story is always moving toward Plot Point I, so anything that does not further the action either has to be cut or rewritten. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19423">When you’re writing a screenplay, you have to be ruthless, especially when you’re in the process of solving a problem, even though you may feel you’re cutting the best things you’ve written.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19424">Just serve the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19425">Have you set up the Plot Point at the end of Act I? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19426">Have you executed the Plot Point as effectively as you can? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19427">Does it do the job? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19428">Are you clear about what it is? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19429">If not, you have to define it to yourself clearly, so you can set it up and render it dramatically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19430">Whether it’s an action sequence, or a character decision, or even a change in locale, the Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19431">That’s why you have to take so much time and be so careful in writing Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19432">You have to be totally clear on who these characters are and the story line and execute it properly, so you can move into the First Half of Act II riding the crest of the story wave you have been setting up from the very first scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19433">In most rewrites in the Problem-Solving process it is not surprising to rewrite about eighty to eighty-five percent of Act I, either by sharpening or tightening the dialogue, or writing new scenes that bring the action into sharper focus, and being able to keep only a few scenes from the original pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19434">What’s most important in Act I is making sure enough visual and emotional information is given. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19435">If you need to do a major rewrite to solve a particular problem in Act I, then rethink this unit of dramatic action completely; take some three-by-five cards and restructure the story line on fourteen cards, writing one scene per card—though that is a contradiction when you are writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19436">If you feel you have a problem in Act II, you have to go through the same process; first you have to identify the problem, then locate it in the proper structural framework of the story line before you can actually move into the Problem-Solving process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19437">First, where is the problem as you see it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19438">In the First Half of Act II, or the Second Half of Act II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19439">If the problem is in the First Half, where is it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19440">Between Plot Point I and Pinch I, or Pinch I and the Mid-Point? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19441">If it’s in the Second Half of Act II, does it fall between the Mid-Point and Pinch II, or between Pinch II and Plot Point II?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19442">When you’ve isolated and defined the problem you need to be very specific, narrowing your perception so you can design a solution to the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19443">It’s very important to find out exactly where the problem occurs because then you approach it from a structural overview and thus uncover and refocus the dramatic elements that lead up to the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19444">When you take the problem apart like this you begin to see very clearly what you need to do to fix it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19445">Remember, Act II is approximately a sixty-page unit of dramatic action that goes from Plot Point I to the end of Plot Point II and is held together with the context of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19446">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19447">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19448">The Mid-Point breaks Act II into two basic parts, the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19451">The best way to slide into the action of the First Half of Act II is to make sure you enter a story line from the character’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19452">dramatic need;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19453"> what is it that your main character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19454">What is his or her motivation, or purpose, during the action of the screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19455">What is it that drives him or her through the action in Act II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19456">These are questions you must be able to answer within the context of the entire screenplay.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19469">If your problem is with the main character, he might be talking too much and slowing down the action, or the overall focus of the character may be too narrow or tight (for example, are you going from INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19470">to INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19471">to INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19472">in your scene construction?)—so you may need to open up the action visually, using different locations.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19473">Approaching the problem means you have the ability to go right to that particular section of the screenplay where the problem is, and begin the process by modifying some scenes, or writing new ones. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19474">In many cases you’ll find that you want to replace long and talky dialogue with a visual action, something that reveals character with just a little dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19475">That way you can keep the flow of the story moving forward, bridging both time and action from scene to scene, sequence to sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19476">(More about this in </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-76"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19477">Chapter 11</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19478">.)</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19479">The structural story points of Pinch I, Mid-Point, Pinch II, and Plot Point II, hold the action of Act II in place so that it is clearly anchored and defined within the context of story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19480">In this part of the process you get to make a choice: Do you need to open up the action to make it more visual? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19481">Or can you modify the dialogue and make it work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19482">Remember that the purpose of every scene or sequence is either </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19483">to move the story forward or to reveal information about the character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19484">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19485">So what do you need to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19486">Write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19487">You may want to put this entire section of the First Half of Act II back on fourteen cards, card 7 being Pinch I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19488">Or maybe you need to go into your character’s life and redefine his or her relationships in a short, one- or two-page, free-association essay on the character’s professional, personal, and private life; see if there’s anything there that you can extract and add to the content of the screenplay to open it up a little.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19489">The same principle applies to the Second Half of Act II, no matter what the problem is; whether it is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19490">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19491">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19492">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19493">, first locate it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19494">Paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19495">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19496">Where is it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19497">Is it between the Mid-Point and Pinch II, or between Pinch II and Plot Point II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19498">Once you determine the location, then you can approach from that particular unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19499">First, be clear about the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19500">theme of action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19501"> for the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19502">Where does the problem occur? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19503">Then break it down into its developing structural line; what events lead up to this particular problem? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19504">What do you need to do to restructure the material? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19505">If need be, put the action line down on fourteen cards, then go through the same process you did for the First Half of Act II.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19508">Where in Act III does the problem occur? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19509">Does it deal with the resolution of the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19510">Or is the ending too thin, or too short, or too contrived, or too predictable? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19511">Do you have to expand or open up the action in Act III in order to effectively set up the resolution? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19512">And what about your ending? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19513">If that’s the case, and you think the action’s too thin, you’ve got to go back into your structure of the Third Act and rebuild the action in such a way that the ending becomes the payoff to the entire script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19514">Again, that means writing new scenes, as well as tightening and sharpening others, possibly even changing the point of view, depending on the specific problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19515">Is the ending believable? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19516">Does it happen too fast, or do you need more of a Set-Up? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19517">It might be that you need to create an entirely new ending in order to resolve the action effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19518">Finding a new ending is very common in the filmmaking process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19519">Not only is it a Hollywood practice to gauge audience response toward a particular ending, but screenwriters from all over the world go through the exact same process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19520">An ending either works or it doesn’t; it either resolves the story line or it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19521">And sometimes you don’t know whether it works or not until you have gone through the entire screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19522">The important thing to remember in approaching the problem is that the process is the same; it doesn’t matter whether it’s a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19523">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19524">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19525">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19526">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19532">Recently I conducted a screenwriting workshop in Rio de Janeiro. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19533">Screenwriters from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Chile had been chosen by their respective ministries of culture to participate, and they had all come to Rio to attend the three-week workshop.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19534">It was intense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19535">We met four hours a day, six days a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19536">The first week we spent preparing the material, and the second and third weeks we were writing up to ten pages a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19537">Sometimes more.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19538">It was difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19539">The one thing they needed, I told them, was something they didn’t have—time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19540">They didn’t have time to contemplate their stories, and nurture all those nuances of character; the only thing they could do was write, to throw down all those thoughts, words, and ideas that came to mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19541">That way they could push aside the mind’s resistance and limitations and allow the creative Self to emerge and guide them along the path of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19542">Though Portuguese, Spanish, and English were all spoken, the language barrier proved to be no barrier at all; each writer wrote in his or her native language, the pages were then translated into English, and everybody read the pages in their native language.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19543">My experience with the Latin American writers only reinforced what I’ve discovered in my travels and workshops; that no matter where you are in the world, no matter what language is spoken or what culture you’re in, the language and grammar of screenwriting are the same, whether in Paris or Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Tokyo, or Hollywood; writing is writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19544">The way the screenwriters approach their material may be different, as it is in Europe and America. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19545">But some of the problems are the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19546">The European and Latin American screenwriters basically approach their screenplays in the same way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19547">The Europeans come from a historical, intellectual tradition, and they base their material on the strength of the original concept or idea; this tradition has been laid down and followed since the fifteenth century in all the great universities.</span></p> <p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19548">This approach is still prevalent today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19549">The European screenwriters (and Latin American writers) approach the screenplay from the idea of the story; it is this idea that pushes the story forward, dramatizes it, becomes its visual metaphor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19550">The filmmaker will take the idea and dramatize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19551">Just look at the trilogy </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19552">Red,</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19553">White,</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19554"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19555">Blue,</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19556"> from the great filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19557">Each story embodies a certain idea, like justice, and this theme is seen visually throughout the film, in the characters’ emotions, as well as in the colors of the costumes and locations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19558">The colors reflect the idea, the theme, and become an integral part of each story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19559">Recently I had the opportunity of seeing Michelangelo Antonioni’s latest film, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19560">Beyond the Clouds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19561">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19562">The opening image is of John Malkovich in an airplane high above the clouds, telling us he is a director, an observer of life; we then follow him through the four different episodes of the film and listen to his comments while observing the behavior of the characters.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19563">The idea behind the film is the “search for love,” and following this theme, we observe four different relationships. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19564">In the first segment, the girl is looking for a relationship through “words.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19565">It is the words of love that are important to her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19566">In the second episode the director becomes involved with an exotic woman who searches for the “passion of love.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19567">In the third a marriage of many years is threatened by the husband’s attraction to a beautiful woman, and finally the wife leaves him to search for the love he cannot give her anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19568">And in the last episode a young man pursues a young woman on her way to church, and waits for her during Mass, only to learn that she is “afraid of life,” and will enter a convent the next day.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19569">Everyone is searching for love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19570">It is this idea that drives the film forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19571">Dramatizing the idea creates the structure.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19572">In a film like Wim Wenders’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19573">Wings of Desire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19574">, for example, the screenwriter begins with the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19575">intellectual idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19576">, and then clothes it in a dramatic way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19577">The story is about an angel (Peter Handke) who longs to know what it’s like to be human. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19578">So Wenders shows us what it is to walk the path of a true human being. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19579">In the opening shots we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19580">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19581"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19582">hear</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19583"> the stream of consciousness of humanity as a parade of people passes in front of our eyes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19584">Young and old, we witness their thoughts, their hopes and fears, their worries, their dreams. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19585">It’s a wonderful opening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19586">Finally, the angel descends and becomes a human being, and we follow his journey through life and love, through the joys and sorrow of walking the path of life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19587">But in the United States we approach the screenplay differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19588">Here, the screenwriter begins with an idea, then takes that idea and shapes it into a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19589">story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19590">, fashions it into a dramatic story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19591">What’s the difference?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19592">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19593">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19594">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19595">It is a story about the fragile nature of relationships, the fear of commitment, the patterns of mother and daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19596">During the story we learn about the lives of the women who make up the quilting bee. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19597">But the story focuses on the relationship between Finn (Winona Ryder) and her fiancé, Sam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19598">We witness her doubts and feelings, and through her we see the stories of the other women, woven together just like the “quilt of love” they are making for Finn’s wedding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19599">It is a story, with beginning, middle, and end, and in the end her relationship is resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19600">She follows the crow, who, just like the story in the quilt, leads her to Sam, and the last image we have is the two of them bedding down for the night in his VW bus. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19601">Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19602"> beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19603">It is the story that drives this film, not the idea of commitment in relationships.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19604">A few years ago I saw a short film by a French filmmaker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19605">It was about a man who walks into a McDonald’s restaurant on the Champs-Elysées and buys a huge order of french fries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19606">He finds a strategic spot in the restaurant and suddenly begins throwing french fries all over; at the people, against the walls, on the floors, on the ceiling, everywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19607">The people are furious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19608">(It’s a serious comedy.) Many of the patrons challenge him but the man pays no attention and continues throwing the fries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19609">The police arrive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19610">They warn the man.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19611">But as soon as they leave, the man goes right back to throwing french fries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19612">Soon, the entire restaurant is in an uproar. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19613">At the peak of their frenzy the man whips out a camera and starts taking pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19614">Photograph after photograph is taken, and then in a blazing cut we see these same people as the subject of huge photographs now on display in a prestigious art gallery in Paris. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19615">It is only then that we understand that this man is a renowned artist, and the same people who were cursing him at McDonald’s are now spending huge bucks to buy these so-called works of art.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19616">Art is freedom of expression</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19617">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19618">That’s the idea behind the film; the idea is dramatized.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19619">The European screenwriter takes an idea and dramatizes it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19620">The American screenwriter takes an idea and builds it into a story to dramatize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19621">If we took the idea that art is the freedom of expression, we would create a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19622">So we would search for a visual metaphor, a visual arena, to show our character, the artist, struggling for some kind of new art form, a new expression.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19623">Who is this artist? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19624">What is his life like? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19625">What are the relationships in his life? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19626">Where is he in his career? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19627">What is his relationship to art? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19628">What about his friends, his family? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19629">Is he successful or not?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19630">These questions all have to be answered to create a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19631">We take this information, the answers to these questions </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19632">(writing is really the ability to ask the right questions)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19633"> so we can structure this idea into a story line; we set up the artist’s life in Act I, show who he is and what he does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19634">The Plot Point at the end of Act I will be the particular incident or event which finally shows him that, in order to survive, he must change his artistic expression and seek out a new form, maybe even a new medium. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19635">We set up a crisis period in his life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19636">Act II would focus on his struggle to create a new form, and all the conflicts and hardships he has to endure in his professional, personal, and private lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19637">Gradually, we see him forging his first new form of expression, and then, at Plot Point II, he finds out what he has to do to generate a fusion of environmental and performance art.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19638">Act III would show him executing his new “art form” in the McDonald’s restaurant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19639">Which is the entire French film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19640">Art is the freedom of expression—as seen from the European point of view and an American perspective.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19641">The point to be made is that whether it’s a European or Latin American or American film, the problems of screenwriting are the same; it doesn’t matter in what language or culture the script is being written.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19642">A screenplay is a story told in pictures, and there will always be some kind of problem when you tell </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19643">the story through words</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19644">, and not pictures.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19645">It seems obvious, but I have had this experience over and over again: some of the writers I’ve worked with forget that a screenplay is a story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19646">They feel that if the characters can explain their particular thoughts, feelings, or emotions, the story line will somehow move forward through the characters’ dialogue, not the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19647">Through words, not pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19648">They think because the character talks a lot there will be insight and dimension; but the truth is that we must see the character in a situation that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19649">reveals</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19650"> his/her personality, no matter what the conflict or obstacle, whether it is an internal, emotional one, or an external, physical one.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19651">Why is this significant?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19652">Because at this period in our history, we are in a major communications revolution, and the screenplay is a form that is constantly evolving, for film is a combination of both art and science. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19653">It is a craft that drifts upon the growth of scientific technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19654">There are times when the screenwriter writes something and science has to create a technology to make it happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19655">Like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19656">Terminator 2: Judgment Day;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19657"> the special effects had not been created when the script was completed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19658">They </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19659">hoped</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19660"> the special effects would work, and they did, and because of the science, film took a giant leap forward to making the art of film “more real.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19661">Without the computer graphics created for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19662">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19663">, we would not have been so affected by the dinosaurs in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19664">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19665"> (David Koepp) or the oddity of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19666">Forrest Gump</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19667"> (Eric Roth). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19668">Or all those morphing commercials that are flooding the television screens.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19669">The computer technology of the nineties has literally exploded, creating a global revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19670">The Internet, Web sites, all the on-line systems, connect the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19671">As of this writing over 50 million people in North America were on-line in 1997. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19672">The Wall Street Journal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19673"> says that the number of people using the Internet is going to double and quadruple within a very short period of time.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19674">That’s only the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19675">Around the world people are using the Internet as part of their daily news-gathering ritual, and it is changing the ways we communicate with each other on a global scale. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19676">And this revolution is literally </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19677">changing the way we see things</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19678">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19679">At this point in time we have become a visual society, and are no longer a literate one; the last fifty years have changed all that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19680">No longer do we get our news and opinions from the written word. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19681">We get it from CNN, or the local news, and the Internet; we hear and see our music on CDs and video; and the latest study declares that the average person watches television on the average of three hours a day, more on the weekend; our children are computer literate by the age of six, and most of the time they are the ones who are teaching us to use the computer.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19682">This evolution of science and art is creating a new language of film, a more visual way of telling stories for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19683">The language of film is becoming more visual; scripts filled with pages and pages of great dialogue are now considered “too talky.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19684">Two people talking in an office or restaurant, explaining things to each other, rarely works anymore.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19685">This seems to be one of the most common problems in screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19686">Over and over again, in country after country, most of the stories unfold through dialogue, not action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19687">The characters talk and talk, and this only leads to a story that is dull and boring, developing through events that need to be explained.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19688">Talking heads.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19689">That’s not screenwriting, that’s stage writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19690">An essential part of all screenwriting is finding places where silence works better than words, finding the right visual arena, or image, to tell the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19691">Today’s films are much more visual, the character’s emotional arc expressed through the character’s actions and reactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19692">“What is character but the determination of incident?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19693">says Henry James. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19694">“And what is incident but the illumination of character?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19695">How people react to the incidents and situations of the story tells us something about who they are: in other words, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19696">what they do is who they are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19697">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19698">When I first saw </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19699">Forrest Gump</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19700">, I thought it was a very, very talky film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19701">Most of the story is told through dialogue along with the voice-over narration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19702">Act I reveals who Forrest is, and his voice-over tells us things we need to know, but the dialogue and images don’t contradict each other, they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19703">complement</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19704"> each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19705">Forrest tells us he has to wear leg braces because he has “a curved spine,” and wearing them will make him “straight as an arrow.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19706">At first glance Forrest is dumb, maybe even stupid, as his IQ test states, but “stupid is as stupid does,” he says, quoting his mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19707">And on the surface most people think he’s some kind of retard, a “cripple,” on the ocean of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19708">So we see by his braces that he’s a “cripple,” physically challenged, and this image is shattered when he is chased by the bullies and forced to run for his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19709">Voice-over and dialogue complement each other, and this technique keeps the story from becoming talky, or dull and sentimental. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19710">Forrest is a man who follows his dreams, then makes them come true.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19711">Later, his behavior shows us something else: Forrest Gump is anything </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19712">but</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19713"> a cripple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19714">Though the words, pictures, and actions are different, they complement each other and move the story forward.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19715">The same with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19716">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19717"> (Jane Anderson). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19718">Before the story can truly begin, we need to know who this character is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19719">So Finn’s narration opens the film when she’s a little girl, and tells us about the relationship with her mother, grandmother, and quilting friends, and then, in a beautiful cut to present time, visually tells us what her problem is: her relationship to Sam and how anxious she is about getting married. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19720">She tells us that she has trouble completing things; she’s working on her third master’s thesis because every time she’s getting ready to complete it, she moves on to another subject and starts all over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19721">That, of course, is what her mother did with the men in her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19722">For Finn it is this fear of commitment that drives the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19723">In the end, however, she learns to follow her heart as the crow leads her to her understanding and final acceptance that Sam is truly her soul mate.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19724">Both these screenplays are studies in character, but in order to reveal who the characters are, and what the obstacles are that confront them, we must see who they are, through their actions </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19725">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19726"> their words.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19727">Not through talking heads.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19728">So if you have a problem in that you think your story is being told in words, look for places to illustrate your character’s behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19729">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19730">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19731"> (Callie Khouri) the title characters are packing for a two-day holiday to the mountains. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19732">Here’s the way Thelma packs: She grabs everything in sight, then throws and stuffs it into the suitcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19733">She pulls open her cosmetics drawer and empties the contents into the suitcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19734">Pulls open another drawer of clothes, dumps it into the already bulging suitcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19735">And that, we see, is the way she lives.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19736">Contrast this visually to the way Louise packs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19737">They’re going away for two days, so she takes two pairs of pants, two blouses, two bras, one bathrobe, two sweaters, two pairs of socks, throws in another pair just for good measure, closes her suitcase, wipes clean the single glass in her spotless kitchen sink, and leaves.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19738">The difference between Thelma and Louise is the difference between night and day, an apple and an orange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19739">Just from that simple action of packing a suitcase we learn a wealth of information about these two characters: one is messy, the other is neat, and it certainly reflects who they are in terms of their relationship with the men in their lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19740">Thelma married Darryl when she was seventeen, and the thought of growing old with him is not very appealing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19741">“You get what you settle for,” Louise comments.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19742">Louise is not going to settle for the kind of relationship that Thelma settled for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19743">As a matter of fact, this emotional decision of Louise’s is what kicks the whole story of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19744">Thelma &amp;</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19745">Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19746"> into motion; in the back story Louise’s boyfriend, Jimmy, a musician, has been on the road for three weeks and has not called her once. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19747">And she’s pissed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19748">So, “to get even,” she decides she’s not going to be home when he comes back in town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19749">She’s not going to let him treat her that way, and this decision sets up the whole story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19750">By making the arrangement to be with Thelma out of town when Jimmy arrives home, Louise barrels down the road of fate that leads to her killing Thelma’s rapist at Plot Point I.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19751">Within the context of this story and these characters, the simple illustration of packing a suitcase reveals more information than dialogue ever could.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19752">Instead of having your characters talk about their situation, let their behavior make the story line unfold in a more visual manner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19753">Action is character; what a person does is who he is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19754">Film is behavior.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19755">Now, it may be that your characterization requires your characters to talk a lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19756">That’s okay; just take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19757">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19758">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19759">The whole story is basically dialogue, and one long scene of dialogue leads to the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19760">The difference is in the quality of dialogue; Tarantino is a master at capturing the little quirks of character and behavior, like the discussion Jules and Vinnie have about McDonald’s.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19813">Most of the time it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19814">And no matter where you are in the screenwriting process, the first words-on-paper draft or the rewrite, it doesn’t take much to be overwhelmed by the writing process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19815">We handle this kind of problem in many different ways, of course, like suddenly finding more important things to do; like cleaning the kitchen, or going to the market, or washing the dishes, or going to the movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19816">Whatever.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19817">After all, some parts of the story are more difficult than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19818">And some scenes need more work than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19819">But after a few days struggling with these particular pages, struggling with some of these thoughts and feelings, you may notice some doubts about your abilities as a writer begin to surface. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19820">You may find yourself thinking too much, asking yourself questions like: What am I going to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19821">How am I going to get back on track? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19822">I wonder if I’m in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19823">Writer’s Block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19824">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19825">You’ll question yourself, your talent, your ability to get the job done.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19826">Then one morning you’ll wake up and suddenly recognize that a heaviness of haze and uncertainty hangs around your neck, and the feeling that’s been tugging at you for the last few days erupts and you know you really don’t know what you are doing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19827">You finally admit that you don’t know how to help yourself or where to go and the only thing that makes any sense at all is surrendering to the state you are in—dazed, lost, and confused.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19828">Welcome to the world of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19829">It’s one of those common problems that strike fear in the hearts of screenwriters everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19830">In one of my recent screenwriting workshops, a student came into class one night with a strained and somewhat tortured look on her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19831">When I asked her what was wrong, her eyes welled up with tears and she became very serious, and said, “I don’t know where I’m going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19832">I’m totally lost, I’m confused, and my pages are pure shit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19833">All that’s happening is talk, talk, talk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19834">I keep going around in circles and I don’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19835">I’m so upset, I could cry.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19836">It’s a universal problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19837">How you get out of it varies from person to person, script to script, but the first thing to do is to admit </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19838">you have a problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19839"> and it’s not going to go away until you deal with it, and confront it head-on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19840">That’s just one of the truths of life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19841">In my student’s case she was so close to the material, she couldn’t see it anymore, so the first thing I wanted her to do was just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19842">When you reach this kind of crisis point, you’re so overwhelmed and frustrated that you have to regroup. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19843">Just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19844">Put down your computer, pen, and paper, typewriter, tape recorder, however you’re working, and spend some time contemplating your story: What is your story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19845">What is the dramatic need of your main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19846">How are you going to resolve the story line? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19847">The answers to these questions are the key to getting back on track.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19848">My student’s story was about the reunion of four sisters after the death of their grandfather. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19849">In his will he had left them the house on the lake where they had all grown up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19850">The main character had left this small southern town many years before to seek a professional career in New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19851">She had a lot of success in the city, but at the time the story begins, the company she has been working for all these years has just been purchased by a larger corporation and she’s been informed that a major restructuring of her department is planned, and could possibly affect her position. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19852">That’s the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19853">When the story begins she is uncertain about the future, about her plans, about herself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19854">When she arrives, it is time for an emotional self-inventory, a time to clean up her life and renew her relationships with her three sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19855">She’s thrown into the cauldron of past and present, and must find her own way out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19856">It is a dramatic and emotional situation loaded with dramatic possibilities.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19857">So I started asking some questions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19858">The writer explained she was in the middle of the Second Act, so the first thing I asked her was if she was clear on her structural story points. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19859">She wasn’t, she confessed; she was unsure about the Mid-Point, and felt so confused, she wasn’t sure about Plot Point II either. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19860">She didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19861">So we went through the Problem-Solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19862">Step by step. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19863">The first thing I had her to do was redefine the dramatic structure; so she went back to the story line and structured it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19864">Paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19865">, identifying Plot Point I, Pinch I, the Mid-Point, Pinch II, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19866">She was still somewhat unsure about her ending, about whether the main character should stay and pick up the pieces of her life, or leave to go back to city and confront the uncertainty of change with a newfound awareness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19867">Then I wanted to know if she felt this was a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19868">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19869">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19870">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19871">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19872">“Character,” she replied, without hesitation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19873">I didn’t necessarily agree with that; I thought it might be a problem of both </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19874">Plot and Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19875">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19876">Look at it from both sides. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19877">From the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19878">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19879"> side, the screenwriter had to deal with and know the inside, or emotional subtext, of the story; she had to trace the emotional arc that revolves around the relationships of the four sisters and whether they settle their differences or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19880">From the point of view of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19881">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19882">, she had to be clear about the forces affecting the character from the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19883">outside:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19884"> what happens to the house; if it’s sold what are they going to do, and if they keep it what are they going to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19885">Questions, questions, questions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19886">We started from the character’s emotional state at the time the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19887">What is she feeling when she leaves her home in the city to return for her grandfather’s funeral? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19888">What’s going on in her life? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19889">In her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19890">professional</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19891"> life with her career, and in her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19892">personal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19893"> life, with her relationships, and then in her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19894">private</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19895"> life—what she does for herself, and how she feels about herself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19896">So we explored this a little. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19897">In the back story her company has just been taken over by a conglomerate, so how does she feel about it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19898">How old is she when the story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19899">Is there some kind of biological clock ticking, or already ringing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19900">Is her grandfather’s funeral going to get in the way of an important business decision? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19901">I wanted the writer to define the forces working on the character from the very beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19902">What’s going on with her relationships? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19903">Is she in a relationship? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19904">Is it a good relationship, is it beginning to unravel, or is she alone? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19905">Define it, from the beginning, when they first met. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19906">What would she do if she left her position and looked for another job?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19907">These emotional questions needed to be answered and clearly defined before my student could go back into the story and confidently dig more deeply into the character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19908">Then I had her define her relationship with her sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19909">I asked if she had gone back into the character’s childhood and examined their feelings for one another, suggesting that she could even create some new incidents or events that might have happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19910">When she finished with that, I had her do an exercise in which she created a key experience in the life of the main character (her name was Abby), which might have happened between the ages of ten and sixteen, something that can reflect and become an emotional undercurrent of the story in present time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19911">It may have been something that happened between her and her grandfather, or a traumatic incident with one of her sisters, something Abby still remembers and thinks about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19912">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19913">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19914"> it’s the fact that Louise refuses to take one step in the state of Texas, even though it’s going to cost her life; later we learn she was raped when she was a young girl living there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19915">That’s why she shoots Harlan in the parking lot when he’s attempting to rape Thelma.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19916">“What is character but the determination of incident?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19917">Henry James asks.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19918">I call this particular essay the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19919">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19920"> (see </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-79"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19921">Chapter 13</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19922">). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19923">It is a specific incident that happens to the main character when he or she is between the ages of ten and sixteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19924">What it creates is an undercurrent that reflects a particular situation in the story in present time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19925">In Abby’s case it was her mother’s early death and Abby’s promise to look after her sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19926">And though Abby made the promise, she resented it greatly because it was her dream to move away from the small town she’d grown up in.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19927">I told the writer that she had to dive back into her characters’ lives and redefine Abby’s feelings when she returns and deals with the death of her grandfather, whom she had loved dearly; and how does she feel now that she is returning home? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19928">My student had not even considered these questions, or the emotional forces working on her characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19929">If you’re writing this story, I told her, you have to know your characters’ thoughts, feelings, and emotions; especially during the early years growing up at the lake, as young adults, and, most important, how they feel about each other now, in present time.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19930">Another issue the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19931">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19932"> exercise created was the influence of what the house means to each of the sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19933">In terms of memories, cash value, and sentimental attachment, whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19934">That house means something to each of the sisters; what is it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19935">If you don’t know, just read or reread Chekhov’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19936">The Three Sisters</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19937">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19938">These emotional forces are working on the four characters through the entire screenplay; they are like the threads of color woven through the tapestry of your story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19939">In How </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19940">to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19941"> the physical and emotional pasts of the characters are interwoven through the entire story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19942">The emotional life of the characters, their memories and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19943">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19944"> experience, is structured in such a way that we can see the arc of the Winona Ryder character, see her understanding, awareness, and the change in her relationship to Sam.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19945">If you are writing a story like this and do not know those emotional forces working on your character, it is very easy to run up against “the wall” and keep “going around in circles,” ultimately falling into the well of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19946">Writer’s Block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19947">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19948">Here’s the way it usually works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19949">You’re totally immersed in the day-to-day process of screenwriting, but there may be one scene or sequence that does not work as well as it should and you might begin to wonder why it’s not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19950">It’s just a random thought and you probably pay no attention to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19951">But if the scene still does not work, you might become aware of a subtle shift occurring within yourself, maybe some doubts about why this scene or sequence is failing to come together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19952">Then you might find that you’re talking to yourself, having a little conversation about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19953">The Problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19954">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19955">The first thing that usually happens is you start questioning yourself: “If I weren’t so stupid, I could do this,” you might think to yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19956">And the more you wrestle with the problem, the more your image as a screenwriter begins to erode, and then you might start making disparaging comments about yourself and your ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19957">That’s when you begin sliding into “the pit,” and soon an entire litany of negative judgments descends upon you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19958">“I knew I should have stayed away from this subject,” you might think to yourself; or “I can’t write worth shit.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19959">Soon you’ll begin to expand and enlarge upon your own insecurities, thinking, “I don’t know whether I should be writing this script,” or “maybe I just don’t have the talent to do this.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19960">or, “maybe I should just find a partner and write it with someone else.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19961">It goes on and on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19962">But underneath all these thoughts, comments, or judgments you’re making is the common thread that somehow this is all “your fault.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19963">If you could do it, you would, and if you can’t, it’s because you don’t have the talent or ability to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19964">In short, we turn it inside and blame ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19965">No wonder it’s called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19966">“Writer’s Block.”</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19967">If you’re in this particular dilemma, and your creative voice is smothered by this blanket of doubt and negativity, then it’s time to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19968">give the critic a voice</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19969">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19970">That means giving that judgmental, critical, and negative voice that’s roaming around inside your head the opportunity to speak his or her mind.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19971">First, go to your screenplay pages—it doesn’t matter whether you’re writing on computer, typewriter, pad, or paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19972">Then take out a separate piece of paper and label it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19973">The Critic’s Page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19974">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19975">As you start writing, every time you become aware of a negative comment or judgment coming up, write it down on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19976">The Critic’s Page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19977">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19978">Number the comments, label them, just as if you were making a shopping list. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19979">For example, you might become aware that “these pages are terrible,” or “I don’t really know what I’m doing,” or “This isn’t working,” or “Maybe somebody else should finish it for me.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19980">Maybe “These characters all sound the same,” and it’s apparent that “I’ve lost my vision,” and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19981">Whatever your thoughts and comments are about your pages, just lay them down; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5….</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20066">If you accept this point of view, it means you’re going to have to dig deeper into your material; you’re going to have to stop writing, go back into your character’s life and action, and define and clarify different elements of your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20067">You’re going to have to go back and do new character biographies; define or redefine the characters and their relationships to each other that are the hub of your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20068">In the chapters ahead there will be different exercises offered to deal with problems like this.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20081">Have you ever read something you’ve written and realized it’s the dullest and most boring writing you’ve ever read? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20082">The pages seem worthless, trite, and your worst fears are confirmed: you have no talent, no ability, and the whole experience is like a bad dream. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20083">I mean, who cares, anyway!</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20084">It’s not an uncommon feeling, and while it may be true some of the time, it’s not true all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20085">When you take a look at what you’ve written, and make the judgment that it’s dull and boring, what can you do to fix it?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20086">In other words, what is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20087">nature of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20088">?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20089">To really understand it, we have to explore the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20090">symptoms of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20091">—those traits in your writing style that may lead to writing dull and boring pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20092">And since this is a book about recognizing and identifying the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20093">symptoms</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20094"> of various screenwriting problems, we’re going to take a look at what makes up the essence of dull writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20095">That means examining the relationship between bad writing and good writing, since you can’t define anything until you measure and compare it to something else; nothing exists in relationship to itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20096">And since </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20097">relationship</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20098"> means a connection between two or more things, it means we can’t define dull and boring writing until we know what makes up good writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20099">When you read a well-written screenplay, “a good read,” the words literally leap off the page at you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20100">Part of it is style, yes, part of it is structure, yes, but the real dynamic of good screenwriting is creating strong and active characters, combined with a unique, stylized visual narrative that constantly moves the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20101">Many films reflect this very well: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20102">The Shawshank Redemption, How to Make an American Quilt, Sense and Sensibility</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20103"> (Emma Thompson), blend story with character, and a situation many people can relate to. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20104">Twelve Monkeys</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20105"> (David and Janet Peoples) blends a strong visual style with an interesting dramatic premise, but it’s a “one-line” script (it lacks depth and dimension) that moves the story forward to its contrived and somewhat predictable ending. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20106">Blade Runner</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20107"> (Hampton Fancher and David Peoples) treats this same kind of theme more imaginatively, as does </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20108">The Fugitive</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20109"> (Andrew Davis).</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20110">Strong action and strong characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20111">That’s what makes good screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20112">One of the interesting things about a dull or boring screenplay is that nobody will tell you that it’s dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20113">People will say they didn’t like it, or it didn’t work for them, or they didn’t like the characters or the premise, or maybe it’s too serious, or too funny. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20114">But no one, not even wife, husband, lover, or best friend, will tell you that what you’ve written is a dull and boring screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20115">Go through your own experience and check it out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20116">In the long run, whether you’ve fallen into the pit of “dull and boring” is something you’re going to have to determine for yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20117">You might have to admit the possibility that you’ve written something that needs to be more active, more dynamic, something that will keep the reader turning pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20118">Because that’s what good writing is all about—keeping the reader turning pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20119">So, what are some of those qualities that make up good screenwriting?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20120">Several things: perhaps the most important is to understand that the foundation of all good dramatic writing is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20121">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20122">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20123">All drama is conflict; without conflict you have no character; without character you have no action; without action you have no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20124">And without story you have no screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20125">Dramatic conflict can either be </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20126">internal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20127"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20128">external;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20129"> an emotional story like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20130">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20131">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20132">Sense and Sensibility</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20133"> has internal (and external) conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20134">External conflict is a story where the conflict is outside the character, and the characters face physical (and of course, emotional) obstacles, such as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20135">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20136"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20137">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20138"> (Michael Crichton and David Koepp). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20139">Creating conflict within the story, through the characters and events, is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing, whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20140">In my seminars and workshops, no matter what the language or culture, I find that many screenwriters do not understand the importance of conflict in their stories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20141">And their screenplays reflect that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20142">So many times the characters seem listless, the scenes slow, taking too much time to develop; there is little or no direction, and it boils down to a screenplay that is dull and boring to read.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20143">So what is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20144">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20145">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20146">If you look at the word it means to be “in opposition”; and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character or characters be in opposition to some</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20147">one</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20148">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20149">something</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20150">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20151">Conflict can be anything, a struggle or a quarrel, a battle or a chase scene, internal or external, any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20152">Conflict must be at the very hub of your story, because it is the core of strong action and strong character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20153">If you do not have this conflict, this foundation to your writing, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in the quagmire of dull writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20154">If you wanted to examine “the stuff” that makes dull writing, what would you say? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20155">What is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20156">nature of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20157">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20158">What does it look like? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20159">What does it taste like, and what is its </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20160">essence</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20161">, the seed that sprouts into the tree?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20174">In screenwriting you cure the problem by knowing and understanding its symptoms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20175">For example, suppose a writer wants to create a strong action line and, in so doing, sets up the story so fast, he or she simply skims over, or omits, necessary and essential character information? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20176">It won’t take the writer long to realize the character’s been sacrificed for action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20177">We can identify this because the character will be so busy reacting to the events or the situation that we don’t have an opportunity to learn anything about him or her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20178">That’s a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20179">symptom</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20180">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20181">And it always seems to lead to a dull and boring read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20182">When I see a script unfolding like this, with the character simply reacting to his or her situation, I’ll give the writer thirty pages to see whether it works or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20183">If it doesn’t, I’ll stop reading, because I don’t need to read any more to see the story’s not working.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20184">Screenwriting is a craft; one scene builds upon another, and the visual information we receive is cumulative; it is that relationship between the scene and the dramatic need of the story that keeps it moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20185">As mentioned before, each scene must fulfill one of two major functions in the storytelling process: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20186">A scene either moves the story forward, or reveals information about the main character(s)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20187">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20188">And if that doesn’t happen, and you wander off in some side directions that are unrelated to the main narrative line, then the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20189">gravity of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20190"> will gradually drag your story to a standstill.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20219">Contrast this with what we see on episodic television or on some of the MOWs that grace our television airwaves; usually, it’s unreal people in unreal situations.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20220">That’s because writing for television and writing for film are two different things; one’s an apple and one’s an orange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20221">One is a radio soap opera with pictures, where everything has to be explained, and the other is a story told through pictures, finding places where silence works better than words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20222">In episodic TV, for example, you’re writing characters that have already been created, so writing for series television means the writer has to focus on how these people react in certain situations.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20223">In many of the MOWs, the basis of the story, whether it’s taken from a real-life experience or not, is diluted and watered down into a predictable and convenient story line; the focus is on the commercials, not the show. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20224">“Television is an advertising medium where the shows fill up the time between commercials” is the way one television executive described it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20225">Dramatic choices are made because there’s not enough time to dig deeper to get underneath the character’s skin—to find a bridge to the character’s inner country. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20226">So, if the reader does not believe the dramatic premise and situation, then you’ve had it; there is no “willing suspension of disbelief.”</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20253">Sometimes incidents and events are too </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20254">contrived</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20255"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20256">too predictable</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20257">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20258">Things happen too easily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20259">This is usually because the dramatic need of the main character is not defined or sufficiently well thought out; the obstacles become too predictable, the conflict too shallow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20260">The dramatic needs of the story are being satisfied too easily, and that tends to dilute the narrative drive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20261">What do you get? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20262">Dull and boring.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20263">Other screenplays rely on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20264">subplots</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20265"> to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20266">This dilutes the focus of the main character and gives rise to a thin and one-dimensional characterization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20267">Most of the action is spent </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20268">cross-cutting</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20269"> between the scenes of character that are needed to move the story forward, and scenes of the subplot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20270">The story jumps back and forth between one thread of the subplot and the main story line, and if you set up your First Act this way, then the two stories come together at Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20271">Other times the stories will merge together late in the Second Act, and that makes it more confusing because you don’t really know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20272">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20273"> the story is about, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20274">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20275"> it’s about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20276">Cross-cutting between the story line and the subplot makes the reader work too hard trying to figure out what the relationship is between the two or more threads of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20277">Sometimes a subplot is necessary, but if the essential story points have not been set up and introduced properly, the story become so complicated that it’s difficult to understand what’s going on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20278">An easy way to spot one of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20279">symptoms of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20280"> is through the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20281">As mentioned, good screenwriting always shows itself in strong character and strong action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20282">So, if you use your main character as an indicator, and feel that he or she is not strong enough, or there’s too much dialogue and not enough visual action, you’re probably right in assuming the character is weak and reactive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20283">In this case the character appears to ride the surface of the story line, and there’s not enough information to go deeper into the psyche of the character to see what’s really going on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20284">Think about creating an incident that works upon your character in such a way that his or her reaction reveals a more forceful and illuminating dimension of character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20285">This creation of incident will be reflected in the scenes you choose to write, for the screenplay is revealed through the scene; it is the cell of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20286">A scene is composed of shots, what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20287">camera sees</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20288">, and it can either be a single shot, or a series of shots, held together by a specific </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20289">location;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20290"> where the scene takes place, and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20291">time</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20292"> when it takes place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20293">If you change either place or time, then you have to change the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20294">Moving from the kitchen to the living room to the garage means three different scenes, because there are three separate locations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20295">If you had a scene in the kitchen in the morning, then have one in the afternoon, it’s two different scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20296">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20297">Because you have to change the light; morning light is totally different from afternoon light, so if you change the time, that means making a lighting change and you must therefore write a new scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20298">Basically, there are two ways to create a scene: one is to write the scene in the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20299">direct</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20300"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20301">obvious</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20302"> way, in which the characters do what is expected and natural. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20303">Since the primary ingredient of drama is the unexpected, you try to play against the grain of the scene, that is, take the unexpected approach.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20304">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20305">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20306">, when Tommy, the young man, tells Andy and Red a former cell mate had revealed to him that he had murdered a banker’s wife and her lover, “and the banker got blamed for it,” we know for the first time that Andrew (Tim Robbins) is innocent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20307">When Andy goes to the warden and tries to convince him of his innocence, the warden refuses to listen, and throws him in the hole for a month.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20308">The next scene shows Tommy being called outside to have a “heart-to-heart” talk with the warden. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20309">The warden wants to know “the right thing to do” and wants Tommy’s help to verify if what he told Andy is true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20310">Would Tommy be willing to “swear before a judge and jury…having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20311">“Just gimme that chance,” Tommy replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20312">The warden nods, understanding, puts out his cigarette, looks up at the guard tower, then turns away, and in that instant Tommy is gunned down.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20313">The obvious way to do that scene would be to have the warden tell Tommy that he’s never going to get a chance to testify, that he knows he’s lying, and nothing Tommy would say or do could convince the warden to open up Andy’s case for a retrial. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20314">Normally, we’d expect the warden would help Andy reclaim his innocence, and count on Tommy to help him do it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20315">And that’s the way Frank Darabont, the screenwriter, sets us up; then he turns everything around when he has the kid gunned down by the prison guard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20316">Now we know who the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20317">real criminal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20318"> is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20319">Then, to rub it in, the warden goes to Andy in the hole, and tells him the boy was shot trying to escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20320">And just to let Andy know who’s really in charge here, he keeps him in the hole for another month. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20321">That action sets up Andy to escape at Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20322">We expect one thing, then something else happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20323">It’s the indirect approach to the scene that makes it work so effectively.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20324">Another symptom of dull screenwriting is when the screenwriter </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20325">enters the scene too early</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20326"> and too much time is spent talking about something totally unrelated that will move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20327">For example, entering a scene too early usually results in the characters talking about something totally unrelated to the purpose of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20328">Enter the scene just before the purpose is revealed; Enter late and get out early is the general rule.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20329">The art of screenwriting is in finding places where silence works better than words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20330">Recently, one of my students told me that after he had completed writing a scene, the thought occurred to him to go back and take another look at it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20331">Something was bothering him about it and he didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20332">So he read and reread the scene, and suddenly understood how he could make it work more effectively with just </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20333">two lines of dialogue</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20334">! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20335">That’s just good screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20336">You don’t need pages and pages of dialogue to set up, explain, or move your story forward; just a few lines will do, if you enter the scene at the right point.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20353">Sometimes a screenplay starts off too quickly, and if the action happens too fast, the reader doesn’t know who or why the character is participating in this action or event. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20354">If the story starts off too slowly, then everything has to be explained through dialogue, so there is no dramatic tension to pull the reader through the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20355">It leads to a dull screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20356">One of the things I’ve discovered about the nature of dull is that while scenes may be structured well, with the dialogue clean and sharp, there is no payoff to the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20357">We don’t see the natural conclusion of the scene because the screenwriter cuts away before the purpose of the scene is fulfilled. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20358">I’ve read so many screenplays where the writer seems to forget why the scene is in there in the first place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20359">Each scene is related to every other, and you’ve only got 120 pages to tell your story, so you can’t waste time writing scenes that are not paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20360">Characters, incidents, events, decisions, all need to be set up at some point in the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20361">It doesn’t have to be in the scene before, or in the same scene, or in the scene after, it can be anywhere, because all aspects of a story line are related to one another and therefore information can be planted anywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20362">It can be set up in the first ten pages, then paid off in Act II or III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20363">What really matters is when you set something up in the screenplay, you have to pay it off, either visually or verbally; either through pictures or dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20364">Another aspect to the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20365">nature of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20366"> is overwritten scene description. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20367">People across the world ask me how long a descriptive paragraph should be, and I reply that any descriptive paragraph, whether it’s action or character, or any combination of the two, should not be longer than four sentences.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20368">Why four? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20369">There are many reasons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20370">First, when you’re writing a screenplay there has to be a lot of white space on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20371">Long, bulky, single-spaced paragraphs that take up a half page or more are just too difficult to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20372">I tell my students that I don’t care what the particular action is, they just can’t put it all into one descriptive paragraph. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20373">Break the paragraph up into four or five sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20374">A reader reads the screenplay as if he or she is seeing the movie on the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20375">So pages have to be lean, clean, and tight, and not bogged down with a lot of descriptive comments that will never make their way to the screen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20376">The quickest way to make a reader put down a screenplay is to stop him with a lot of thick and bulky paragraphs that fill up the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20377">It turns the reader off, and becomes another symptom in the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20378">nature of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20379">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20446">What happens when you read a screenplay and you have the impression that something’s wrong with it, but you don’t really know what it is? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20447">If you think about it, you might be able to trace your awareness, or discomfort, from the very beginning of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20448">And if you examine that feeling a little further, then go back and take another look at the material, you’ll probably see that the problem has been present right from the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20449">As a general rule, if you want to find the origin of any problem you have to start looking for it at the very start—from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20450">If you do that and analyze the material, you may begin to notice some things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20451">For example, there may be too many characters, or you don’t really know who the main character is, who the story is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20452">Or maybe it just feels like the script is too talky and the action progresses more through dialogue and exposition than the visual image. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20453">Or so much seems to be happening that the focus of the story, what it’s really about, seems choppy, sloppy, and disjointed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20454">Look at the material again, and you will probably realize that there is so much information being given and the story moves so fast, you might not really know what’s going on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20455">All these elements are symptoms of too much information being given too early in the story; too much is happening too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20456">The result: not enough depth or insight into the characters and not enough conflict or drama in the narrative line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20457">And it’s definitely a problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20458">If you want to look for the cause or the source of this particular problem, it will almost always be found in Act I and, more specifically, in the first ten pages of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20459">A good screenplay is set up from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20460">Act I is a unit of dramatic action that begins with the opening scene and continues until the Plot Point at the end of the act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20461">It is held together with the dramatic context known as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20462">Set-Up;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20463"> because all the elements of the story, the characters, the dramatic premise and situation, the relationships between them, must be established within this particular unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20464">Act I is a unit of action in which all the elements of the story must be carefully integrated and set up; all the incidents and events in this unit of action must lead directly to the Plot Point at the end of Act I, the true beginning of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20465">If the script is not set up correctly, then there is a certain tendency to keep adding characters and events to the story line to make it move faster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20466">The story seems to skate on the surface of the action without penetrating its layers of texture and depth, creating the feeling that the story is trite, contrived, and predictable.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20467">Why does this happen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20468">It seems like many writers approach their screenplays without enough preparation; they’re so anxious to begin writing the script that they don’t take the time to explore and develop the relationships between the action and characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20469">So they begin from the smallest kernel of information and then feel their way through the First Act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20470">Most of their time is spent trying to figure out what the story is about and what happens next, so they throw down as many story points as they can in the First Act, hoping the story will manifest itself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20471">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20472">Seeds are planted, but not cultivated, watered, or nourished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20473">The writer tells his or her story in the first ten pages, then is lost and doesn’t know what to do next.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20474">Preparation and research are essential to the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20475">It is the responsibility of the screenwriter to know and clearly define who the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20476">main character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20477"> is, what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20478">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20479"> is—what the story is about—and what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20480">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20481"> is—the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20482">If you don’t know the story well enough, if you haven’t spent enough time doing the required research, then you run the risk of inserting more incidents and events into the story line just to try to make it work, and then the narrative thread of the story usually goes awry; the stuff just isn’t working.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20483">Sometimes the problem exists because the story line is too thin, and more “plot” has to be found, but the solution is not creating more interesting incidents or characters to put into the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20484">Creating more “things” to happen, more obstacles to confront, doesn’t do anything except expand the problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20485">The trouble is often traceable to a writer’s impulse to get the script off to a fast and provocative start. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20486">If you’ve only got ten pages to grab the attention of the reader or audience, then the tendency is to make sure the story captures the reader’s interest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20487">And often that means dumping the characters, their obstacles, and their relationship with the other characters into this ten-page unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20488">It’s too much, too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20489">More is not necessarily better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20490">If you take great screenplays like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20491">Shawshank Redemption, Thelma &amp; Louise, The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20492">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20493">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20494">, all the major ingredients of the story line are either there in place, or referred to, within the first ten-page unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20495">That’s why the context of Act I is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20496">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20497">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20498">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20499"> is a great example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20500">Since the story deals with Andy in prison, we have to set up the murder of Andy’s wife and lover, as well as the trial and verdict, before he enters the prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20501">We have to know why he’s there and what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20502">crime</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20503"> he has committed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20504">The three threads of the story line—murder, trial, and verdict—are brilliantly intercut, so we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20505">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20506"> the events leading to his conviction even though we don’t actually see him committing the murders.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20507">Many screenwriters would approach the story from the perspective of dialogue; they might begin with Andy entering the prison, and then, during his relationship with Red, he would tell the story in bits and pieces. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20508">As Red informs us in voice-over, Andy didn’t seem to belong in the prison population; when he walked “he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or worry.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20509">During their first few scenes together he could explain to Red about the murder of his wife. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20510">In terms of setting up the story this approach would work, but then the tendency might be to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20511">explain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20512"> rather than </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20513">reveal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20514">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20515">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20516">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20517"> the first ten pages set up all the narrative threads that are needed to establish the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20518">After newsreel shots of the fire that killed the three astronauts of Apollo 1 (the transition from newsreel to present time, TV to TV, is very much like the flashback transitions in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20519">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20520">, except the quilt is used as the visual motif), the script opens with a friendly partylike gathering watching Neil Armstrong’s first walk on the moon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20521">In just a few words we learn these people are astronauts in the current NASA program and the dream of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is to land on the moon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20522">In just a few pages we know everything we need to know, including the suspicion that his wife has some deep fear about his going into space again.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20539">That’s a lot of information to present in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20540">But it’s been set up in both narration and pictures, so we see the father’s widow and his three daughters are literally without the roof over their heads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20541">The rest of Act I deals with how the family is going to cope with this new situation, and we see them play it out in scene after scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20542">The girls have to be married, of course, for in those days women needed husbands to take care of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20543">And when the possible match between the Emma Thompson character with Hugh Grant doesn’t happen, the girls give up the house to their brother and move to the country. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20544">Plot Point I.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20559">Take a look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20560">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20561">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20562">It’s all there.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20563">That’s why each element of the story line must be carefully laid out before you even begin writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20564">Believe it or not, most problems in screenwriting are there because not enough research was done; the story, the characters, and all the dramatic forces working on the story have not been thought out enough.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20565">The inclination to put too much, too soon, into your story line is, I find, usually the result of a number of different things, but the primary cause is that most writers don’t spend enough time doing character research. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20566">A biography of the main character may not have been written, or maybe not enough was written, with the result that the character seems thin or unsympathetic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20567">The result: a weak character so busy reacting to all the incidents and events of the plot that he or she becomes passive and seemingly disappears off the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20568">The main character will have no point of view, and some of the lesser, or minor, characters take over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20569">The main character becomes lost in the background.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20570">If you examine the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20571">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20572"> you’ll see that almost all the symptoms seem to stem from the writers not knowing the characters well enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20573">Too many plot twists and turns have to be explained, and the action wanders—as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20574">Diehard 3</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20575">—the dramatic premise forgotten or unclear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20576">This happens in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20577">Broken Arrow</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20578"> (Graham Yost), the John Woo film in which character is sacrificed for action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20579">What carries the film, of course, is not the story or the characters, but the action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20580">This particular problem of too much, too soon, is defined as a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20581">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20582">, but the symptoms we’ve been analyzing stem from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20583">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20584">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20585">Why is that?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20586">Because to fix this kind of problem you’ve got to open up, develop, and enlarge the incidents of the story line, adding new </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20587">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20588"> elements even though the problem evolves from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20589">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20590">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20591">For example, a woman was writing a story that takes place in the sixteenth century about a band of traveling musicians. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20592">The main character is a young woman, deeply in love and recently married, whose husband, when the story opens, is accidentally killed in a river accident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20593">Right after the funeral, her father is determined to marry her to an old man, a very rich and respected merchant, but she refuses and will not obey his commands or honor his wishes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20594">She doesn’t know what to do, but when she’s invited to a lord’s estate to cure his young son (she’s set up to be a natural healer), she allows herself to be seduced by him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20595">Her action permits her to get out of the unbearable situation with her father, but sets her apart from the others in the band. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20596">She is filled with pride and independence and no one is going to tell her what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20597">Especially when it concerns her feelings.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20598">The nobleman is enchanted with her, but when he learns she has used him (he was only a solution to a problem, after all) he vows that if he can’t have her, no one else will either. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20599">So he sets into motion a plan that will keep her as a prisoner in his castle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20600">And we know that if she ever goes to prison, this free spirit will literally wither and die.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20601">That’s basically the story, and it works well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20602">When my student began writing the screenplay, she began hurrying the action, putting in too much information because she thought she had to explain how the musicians lived, what their society was like, and their interrelationships within this musical clan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20603">She structured Act I this way, opening with the group crossing a raging river, when suddenly the husband falls into a swirling eddy and can’t swim against the mighty current and drowns. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20604">The young wife rushes to him, but it’s too late. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20605">The funeral follows, and immediately following the ceremony her father tells her that he has sold her to the old man, the merchant, and she must marry him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20606">She can’t deal with it and flees, but after a few weeks the young widow is summoned to the nobleman’s estate to cure his son. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20607">The son recovers, the nobleman becomes infatuated with her, and she determines that he is the answer to her prayers and lets herself be seduced.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20608">Being seduced by the nobleman is the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20609">It gives us enough time to set up the death, the relationships within the band, and establish the dramatic premise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20610">The dramatic and visual possibilities are strong, the emotional opportunities rich. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20611">The narrative flow of events gives us a good insight into the arena of life of the traveling musicians.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20612">But the woman was still insecure about the story and wrote everything that should happen in Act I into the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20613">She literally shoved everything together so the main character meets the nobleman by page 10. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20614">As a result, everything happens so fast that nothing is really developed; all the insights that could give us a full and rich portrait of the characters were omitted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20615">In terms of story, there was too much information being given too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20616">Everything was mashed together and the events simply rode on the surface of the story like a leaf floating on the water.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20617">When I explained that she had too much information in these first pages, she did not really know how to fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20618">I told her she had to go back into her characters in order to get more material, so as to develop Act I more completely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20619">So I gave her an exercise: I had her write a free-association essay about the main character’s emotional state; what her feelings were for her husband/lover during their courtship and marriage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20620">Then I had her develop an emotional back story to her character; what happened between wife and husband immediately before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20621">Maybe they had an argument the morning before crossing the river; maybe they had just finished making love and vowed their love for each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20622">I had her describe the character’s feelings of grief and loss, her anger at being left behind without him, and her fury and frustration at being bound by the constraints of this unwritten law.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20623">The exercise helped the woman approach some of those emotional bridges that have to be crossed in order to develop character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20624">When she became more familiar with her character’s emotional life, I had her take each one of the events she had written in those first ten pages, and separate them into individual sequences with a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20625">I had her write them all out, in a page-or-two essay; when she finished, she could add and create new material that would allowed her to open up the fertile landscape of her story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20626">A </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20627">sequence, remember, is a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20628">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20629">A funeral, a wedding (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20630">Four Weddings and a Funeral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20631"> is really five sequences strung together), a chase, a shootout, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20632">Here’s how we broke it down for Act I: The band moving toward the river then crossing the river is one sequence; being swept away and the chase leading to the young husband’s death, another; her reaction to the loss, her mourning, the funeral, another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20633">All these sequences are complete within themselves and can be structured individually into beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20634">Because the new material has to be expanded, structured, and woven into the story line, it brings more depth and dimension to the emotional needs of the character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20635">That’s why it’s a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20636">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20637">, though it encompasses elements of both </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20638">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20639"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20640">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20641">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20642">The solution to this particular problem is more easily approached from the perspective of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20643">Plot;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20644"> that is, we add events to the story line in order to develop the dramatic action more fully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20645">I’m sure it would be easier if we could clearly and conveniently separate each problem into its own little category complete unto itself, but that’s not the way it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20646">In life, as in screenwriting, everything is related to everything else.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20647">Because </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20648">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20649">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20650">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20651"> are the foundations of screenwriting, they will always be interrelated, though certain problems can be approached more easily via one category than another.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20652">You could also solve this kind of problem by approaching it from the category of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20653">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20654"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20655">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20656">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20657">It really doesn’t matter how you approach the problem as long as you identify and define it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20658">What’s most important is to find the right way to set up your story; find the picture, or the scene, that best illustrates the story </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20659">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20660"> the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20661">As mentioned, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20662">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20663">, the script opens with Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) and other astronauts at a party, watching Neil Armstrong’s landing on the moon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20664">The picture on TV and the simple comments by the characters let us know immediately that these people are involved in the space mission to the moon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20665">Within the first ten pages we know that Jim Lovell’s dream, his dramatic premise, is to return to the moon.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20666">All this information has been set up simply and economically by the screenwriter’s knowledge of who these characters are, what their dramatic need is, what the story is about, and the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20667">What’s set up in Jim Lovell’s case is that he knows he may never fly to the moon again because of the accident in the Apollo spacecraft.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20668">This is just good screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20669">Everything we need to know, we know within this first ten-page unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20670">It sets up the story so that Plot Point I, the true beginning of the story, is the blastoff into space for the Apollo 13 mission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20671">And thus the temptation to set up the story through dialogue has been avoided.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20672">When you think you have a problem, go back into the material and reread it from the point of view that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20673">maybe too</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20674">much is happening too soon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20675">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20676">Is the front end of your screenplay, the first 10 pages, overloaded with information, characters, or events? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20677">Is so much happening so fast that the reader becomes lost or does the major focus of the story line seem lost?</span></p>

<h1 class="chap_title3"><b class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20722">The Need to Explain</span></b></h1>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20723">Recently, I read a screenplay about a boat builder on the coast of the Yucatán who is forced out of business by an unscrupulous politician demanding bribes and he reacts by floundering in a lifestyle of drunkenness and bankruptcy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20724">He becomes his own victim. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20725">Since the story is about his redemption, we see him go through his transformation by joining a rebel action to help bring about the fall of a Central American dictator.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20726">It is a good action piece, has great visual locations, and has the potential to be a good vehicle for the character’s growth, change, and development. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20727">But the screenplay didn’t read that way and the story’s potential was never realized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20728">And here’s why.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20729">The writer opens the screenplay with a scene where the main character delivers a boat, which he has been commissioned to build for the politician. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20730">Everything seems fine; there are nice visuals but no real conflict as the scene is meant to reveal the extraordinary design abilities of the main character, the builder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20731">The boat he has built is literally a piece of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20732">And, the way the scene is written, both characters seem satisfied with the transaction.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20733">Cut to five years later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20734">The main character is now struggling for work, has the reputation of being unreliable, an alcoholic, and we see him lose several jobs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20735">And his design abilities are never again mentioned or play any significant part in the rest of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20736">At Plot Point I, needing money, he accepts a job as a crew member on a large fishing boat, and during a severe storm the boat is shipwrecked farther up the coast. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20737">Forced to remain in this thinly populated area while they repair the boat, they discover a band of guerrillas who enlist them in their cause to overthrow the local political dictator, a man groomed and supported by the same unscrupulous politician that ran the main character out of business. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20738">He joins them and takes the first steps along his journey of repentance that leads to recognizing his own self-worth and regaining his dignity as a person.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20739">That’s the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20740">During the first part of my read things seemed okay, but around page 30 I began to notice that my attention was wandering, and the more I read the more aware I became of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20741">So I knew something was wrong; something was not working as well as it should. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20742">I started looking for the source of the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20743">What I began to see was that the main character was constantly reacting to the situation, and somehow he seemed to be lost on the page in relationship to the other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20744">He was involved in every scene, yes, but he seemed bland and uninteresting, and just seemed to disappear off the page.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20745">The first symptom.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20746">I went back to the very beginning of the screenplay, and started looking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20747">When I examined the opening scene between the builder and the politician, I saw there was no conflict at all between the two men, either internal or external. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20748">And in the next scene, when the writer cuts into the story five years later, we see the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20749">reaction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20750"> to the man’s plight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20751">What I saw immediately is the main character was always explaining his actions, his situation, his life, to the other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20752">That stopped the forward flow of the story as the character has to justify why he is here, what he is feeling, what his dramatic need is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20753">Because the reader isn’t shown the character falling into the pit of hard times during those five years, he or she has to be informed what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20754">If you don’t show it, you have to say it; you have to explain it for the story to move forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20755">And when that happens your character is lost on the page, caught in the web of talking heads.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20756">We don’t have to explain everything in a screenplay; we just have to know what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20757">It’s not a question of not explaining anything, it’s a question of how the explanation is written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20758">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20759">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20760"> the very first shot under the credits is the actual newsreel footage of the first Apollo astronauts caught in the fire in the space capsule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20761">Three lives were lost, and if we didn’t see this, we would have to explain it, because it is the spark that ignites the whole story, moving Jim Lovell’s crew up to the Apollo 13 slot in the NASA schedule.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20762">Many times during the screenplay the screenwriter will have the urge, or the need, to explain things—things about the character, things about the situation, things about the story—because if something is not clear, it has to be explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20763">It is one of the most common problems screenwriters encounter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20764">The process of screenwriting always remains the same, but the creative problems are always different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20765">If there is an action scene, and we don’t know what’s happening, it has to be explained at some point in order to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20766">That’s the only way to hold the reader or audience’s interest.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20767">Exposition is a key element in the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20768">The word itself is defined as the “information necessary to move the story forward.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20769">There are two ways to write exposition; set it up through dialogue, or dramatize it through pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20770">Exposition is the easiest, yet the hardest, dialogue to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20771">It states the obvious, which makes it easy, because the screenwriter simply puts down what needs to be said in order to move the story forward; hard, because the dialogue is usually so obvious, it’s embarrassing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20772">How do you solve this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20773">By finding ways to dramatize the exposition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20774">By finding the right visual image, or metaphor, to serve the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20775">Broken Arrow</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20776"> opens with a fight scene in which Deke (John Travolta) is boxing with his air force copilot, Hale (Christian Slater). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20777">Who these characters are, and the forces working upon them, are revealed by their actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20778">Deke doesn’t hesitate to use any maneuver he can to defeat Hale. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20779">Hale believes in the rules, fighting hard to win, but never sacrificing his humanity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20780">There is a dialogue between the two men within the riveting action of this scene, and it reveals everything we need to know about their characters throughout the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20781">And, in the end, the motivation, or purpose, behind Deke’s plan to steal two nuclear weapons only needs to be explained in a few lines of dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20782">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20783">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20784"> we create the explanation of the story, the premise, in the little interactive presentation that the Sir Richard Attenborough character puts on for his visitors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20785">In his demonstration that is part animation and interactive live action, he explains that mosquitoes in the Jurassic Park era would feed off the dinosaur’s blood, then get trapped in tree sap, which would fossilize to amber. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20786">Now, millions of years later, the amber is pierced and the mosquito fossil’s blood siphoned off, and through the advancement of genetic technology we have been able to create dinosaur clones.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20787">That’s the entire premise of the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20788">If we don’t believe that, then “there is no willing suspension of disbelief” and the story becomes a joke.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20789">So, how do they set this up? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20790">They explain it, sure, with both pictures and images. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20791">But first you have to grab the reader or the audience’s attention, so the script opens with an action sequence that reeks of mystery and suspense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20792">That’s Spielberg’s great gift as a filmmaker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20793">We don’t yet know what’s going on, but we know something really big and mean is inside that cage of steel and it’s very, very dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20794">Take a look at this sequence again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20795">Nothing is explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20796">All we can do is watch as one of the technicians is yanked and hurled around like a piece of lettuce in a tossed salad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20797">And at the end of the sequence we still don’t know what’s going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20798">But we’re hooked; that’s why in action-oriented films, or certain types of mysteries or thrillers, the writer opens with an action sequence that needs to be explained at some point during the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20799">It’s called the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20800">“inciting incident.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20801"> A primary rule in screenwriting is that we discover what’s going on at the same time the character does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20802">The main character and the reader or audience are connected by the mutual effort of trying to figure out what’s going on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20803">Things have to be explained; sometimes through words, sometimes through pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20804">It all depends on the type of screenplay you’re writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20805">The premise established, we meet the main characters, Sam Neill and Laura Dern, in the Badlands of South Dakota, working the dinosaur digs, using the latest computer technology to isolate the fossil remains of some prehistoric animal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20806">A helicopter lands, bringing the Attenborough character, who convinces the two scientists that if they come with him and “sign off” on his project, he will fund their research digs for the next three years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20807">They can’t say no to that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20808">They do need funds to continue their research project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20809">So, they cannot “not” go.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20810">That’s the first ten pages of the screenplay; nothing is explained, but it’s all been set up, the situation demonstrated.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20811">Now the second ten pages of dramatic action begin, and here it becomes necessary to establish exposition; there is the need to explain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20812">As the characters drive through the open landscape, they see their first dinosaurs, living and breathing and roaming as they were during the Jurassic Period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20813">It’s like being lost on an island in time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20814">Again, as we see the explanation, we don’t need to explain it through dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20815">And this is where the questions of “how they do it” and “why they do it” become important and do need to be explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20816">That’s when we have the little interactive presentation explaining the science and technology, set amid the activity of the high-tech laboratory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20817">The other characters are introduced and now we’re ready to begin the “true” story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20818">At Plot Point I they enter Jurassic Park and the massive gates swing shut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20819">Everything has been set up and explained, the characters introduced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20820">Some explanations are part of the visual arena; for example, when they enter the park they see a cow being hoisted into a compound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20821">The young girl is appalled as we hear a vicious roar, then witness a lot of activity within the trees and then we see the empty harness, broken and bloody, being lifted out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20822">Nothing needs to be said; no words are necessary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20823">It’s feeding time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20824">We see the same thing with a goat chained to a post. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20825">Sitting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20826">Waiting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20827">A short time later, after the storm hits, we see only the chain swinging back and forth, empty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20828">Then the T-rex is upon them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20829">A screenplay is a story told with pictures, so we have to create the pictures that reveal the story and keep it moving forward; then exposition and the need to explain are kept at a minimum.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20830">The problem with so many screenwriters is that they rely too heavily on dialogue to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20831">In some screenplays, like the one mentioned at the front of this chapter, scene after scene deals with some kind of explanation about something that’s already happened.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20832">The result: the story moves too slowly, and seems to wander in several different directions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20833">And despite the characters’ constantly seeming to explain themselves, the impression is that they are not well-defined, are passive instead of active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20834">Washed out on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20835">In the story about the boat builder in the Caribbean, it became necessary for the screenwriter to explain everything because </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20836">certain scenes had been omitted in the story line</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20837">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20838">That makes it a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20839">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20840">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20841">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20842">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20843"> the exposition is presented with a combination of visual elements in order to move the story forward; the introduction of the Sam Neill and Laura Dern characters on the fossil dig in the South Dakota Badlands shows us who these characters are, so the story doesn’t become bogged down in explanations, as the writers weave the threads of the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20844">When you’re writing a screenplay you have to explain things, that’s part of the nature of the medium, but the real question is in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20845">how you do it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20846">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20847">Whether through dialogue or pictures.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20848">Think about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20849">If you feel there’s something not quite working in your script, take a look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20850">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20851"> and see whether you’re explaining too much. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20852">Here’s what you can do.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20853">First, you’re dealing with an action and a character, and then you’re creating conflict, so we have to know what your character is thinking and feeling in this particular situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20854">If you start explaining too many things, your story line becomes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20855">confused</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20856"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20857">complex</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20858">, because you always have to explain what’s happening to your main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20859">To fix it you have to add elements to the story line </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20860">(Plot)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20861">, and many times these dramatic events seem somewhat </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20862">contrived</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20863"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20864">predictable</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20865">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20866">And if your story is moving forward mainly through dialogue, it becomes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20867">talking heads</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20868">, and when that happens some of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20869">lesser characters start taking over the action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20870">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20871">To solve this kind of problem you need to rethink your story from two points of view, from the visual as well as the character aspect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20872">Do your scenes have enough of a visual dynamic? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20873">Or, do they take place in offices, rooms, and restaurants? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20874">In other words, does your screenplay go from INTERIOR to INTERIOR to INTERIOR to INTERIOR with hardly any EXTERIORS anywhere? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20875">If you are explaining things too much, one of the first symptoms you look for is whether the story is too closed or too narrow, and if it is, then you have to open it up visually.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20876">Here’s an example from a script that one of my students wrote. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20877">The story, a period piece set in the forties, is about a woman pilot who wants to compete in an aerial race flying a World War II fighter plane that has only been flown by men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20878">During the story she has to battle the prejudice against her, her own fear that she may not be able to do it, as well as other obstacles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20879">And because there is a lot of information that has to be given about the main character, the writer started to explain too many things.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20880">First, I have to say that this entire exercise is taken out of context and is totally speculative. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20881">The scene I’m going to excerpt is between the main character, Kate, and her boyfriend, Holt, also a pilot, who reluctantly supports her in her quest to be the first woman to fly this plane in competition.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20955">For example, Holt says that in an exhibit at the museum (Kate is assistant director), “you plot, plan, research, study, talk to a lot of people, and the day the thing opens, you’re a wreck.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20956">All true, but we’ve not seen this side of her character yet in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20957">We’ve only seen bits and pieces of her at the museum, and never under any kind of stress or pressure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20958">In order to really open up the script, we have to show her in some kind of emergency situation, which she handles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20959">All drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20960">As I like to say, without conflict there is no action; without action there is no character; without character there is no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20961">And without story there is no screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20962">What makes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20963">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20964"> so effective is that Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a student at the FBI Academy and over and over again we see her in the training environment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20965">We see her skill with a gun, in hostagelike situations, on the firing range, in the library, and she discovers the severed head of a murder victim, so we know that when she comes face to face with the serial killer in the basement, she can hold her own. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20966">We know that she can take care of herself, and this has carefully been structured into the story line from the very beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20967">The first time we see her she’s running the obstacle course, and we learn in the next scene that she ranks in the upper quarter of her class, comprised of both men and women.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20968">If we had not seen that she could take care of herself in dangerous situations, then the ending of the film would have been totally unsatisfying; there would be no “willing suspension of disbelief” and we wouldn’t buy it at all.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20969">In the story about the woman pilot, a possible way to approach the scene and make it more visually effective without explaining things is to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20970">add new scenes</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20971"> to set up this scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20972">Then you can use the emotional currents to make it more potent and energetic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20973">That’s why the problem can be solved through </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20974">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20975">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20976">We can also approach it from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20977">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20978">, and that means going deeper into the relationship between Kate and Holt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20979">In this particular draft of the script Kate and Holt have been together a little over two years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20980">We don’t know much about this relationship, other than what has been explained through the dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20981">He’s there for her, supportive in her need, but there’s no </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20982">past</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20983"> to this relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20984">It has to be created by the writer, with written essays about how they met, their past relationships; who they were with, how long it lasted, what happened that led to their breakup. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20985">These things have to be known, otherwise they will not be defined and will have to be explained.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20986">There’s another part of the scene that can be explored, and that’s the relationship with “Chris,” the friend of Holt’s who died in a plane crash before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20987">So far, he’s only been talked about, never shown. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20988">That’s the kind of scene that would affect the present scene directly; Chris’s crash was not included in the script, but if we had seen it, and its effect on the characters, we might have been able to set up the relationship between Holt and Chris as well as between Kate and Chris. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20989">If we knew this relationship, we could get deeper into the emotional context of the scene at hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20990">Both characters could be struggling with their feelings in this scene; Holt with his memory of Chris, and his fear for Kate, and Kate in her relationship with Chris, her own fear she must confront, and her relationship with Holt, the man she loves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20991">Remember </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20992">Top Gun;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20993"> it’s this element of the Tom Cruise character conquering his own fear that drives the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20994">It would add a much deeper dimension to the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20995">Instead, all the emotional nuances of the scene are approached through dialogue, explained rather than seen or felt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20996">Because the emotional forces working on the scene were not prepared deeply enough, the presentation seems confined to the surface, lacking in depth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20997">We don’t know what Kate’s thoughts and feelings are except what she says.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20998">It’s true that this is only one scene in the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20999">But look how indicative it is; the whole screenplay is written in this tone, and it lacks a force and an energy that should be driving a story like this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21000">Film is a visual medium and it must be approached both through its action and its character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21001">Otherwise, you just have to explain everything.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21053">When I’m reading a screenplay, I’m always looking for a story line that’s lean, clean, and tight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21054">I want the characters to move through the narrative landscape with a strong dramatic need and strong point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21055">I want to be surprised and don’t want the story to seem contrived or predictable, and I want all scenes and sequences to be related to one another, where nothing, neither a throwaway action nor a line of dialogue, is tossed in just to keep the story moving forward.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21056">It’s what I call “the good read.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21057">Unfortunately, I’m disappointed most of the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21058">The same goes for almost all the readers in Hollywood, no matter if it’s a studio executive, producer, director, development person, or reader. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21059">Personally, I’m directly involved in the reading and writing of about a thousand screenplays a year; either I’m commissioned to read them by various producers and production companies, or I’m working with my many students and helping them design and develop their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21060">Over and over again I find certain tendencies within the screenplay that lead directly to a particular problem; as mentioned in </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-73"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21061">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21062">, either there is too much material fueling the story, or not enough; something is missing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21063">Many times during the screenwriting process the screenwriter is faced with the creative choice of whether to write a particular scene or not write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21064">Sometimes a tendency develops where writers will skip scenes that they think are unimportant and unnecessary, scenes they think they could do without. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21065">If you find that you start asking yourself “whether I really need to write this scene or not,” you begin a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21066">critical process</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21067"> of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21068">making a judgment</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21069">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21070">And while that is a positive and necessary step in the screenwriting process, if overdone it can lead to a creative decision that results in your </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21071">not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21072"> writing the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21073">And once this process has been formed as part of the writing process, once you get into the pattern of saying, “No, I don’t need to write this scene,” for whatever reason—you establish the habit of saying no.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21074">Then you’re in trouble.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21213">Because the subplot springs from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21214">action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21215"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21216">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21217">, it means you have to create the particular incidents and events and then structure and weave them through the dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21218">That’s why you solve this particular problem by approaching it from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21219">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21220"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21221">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21222">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21231">How would you go about building this particular subplot? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21232">First, you have to create the other character, in this case a doctor doing research with AIDS, and then find out who he or she is by writing a character biography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21233">Maybe these two doctors have had some contact in the past, either before the story starts, or through various research publications; maybe they even went to school together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21234">You can establish this information through the character biography by writing various essays clarifying and defining the dramatic forces working on these two characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21235">This secondary character will be a major figure in the story, even if he or she is in only a few scenes in the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21236">Setting up a situation this way allows you to select scenes that will add depth to the plot.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21237">By clarifying and defining what brings a new character into the conflict, and how the main character reacts to this new situation, you generate a whole series of actions and reactions that will hook into the main story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21238">You are creating additional action to the story, a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21239">subplot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21240"> that will give the script a new look and feel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21241">Many writers actually develop the subplot as a separate story, then structure it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21242">Paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21243"> and then weave it through the dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21244">That’s why it’s listed more as a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21245">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21246"> than of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21247">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21248">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21274">So Price started developing the kidnappers’ side of the story, and in the subplot we’re able to see who these people are and why they’ve chosen to commit this crime.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21443">A look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21444">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21445"> reveals a lot of common problems that plague screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21446">Many times I’ll read a screenplay and within the first ten pages I can make a fairly accurate “read” of the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21447">I look for a lean, clean, visual style, with an economy of story, the characters and their actions clear and concise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21448">If there are too many characters, or too much action, or too many long-winded scenes, the chances are the script will be overlong, say more than 145 pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21449">If that’s the case, the story line might be too broad, too expansive, too big in scope, resulting in the main character’s not being clearly defined; or there may be too many characters, or too many scenes where the main character is not involved, or a story line that covers too much time and too much action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21450">Scripts that span a number of years, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21451">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21452">, are very difficult to write because the time frame is very long and there may be too many incidents that have to be covered and explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21453">There’s too much going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21454">So when you’re working on a subject that covers a long period of time, you have to know what problems you’re going to be confronting.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21525">It wasn’t too long ago that the screenwriter depended on the director or film editor to create these visual transitions, but at the present time most of the working screenwriters know that it is the writer’s responsibility to write the required transitions from scene to scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21526">One of the recognizable traits of the screenwriter in the nineties is his or her ability to write good visual transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21527">And at the present time there seems to be an evolution in the style and sophistication of the art of transition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21528">Even a script like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21529">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21530">, which is sequential and episodic, uses effective transitions so the five episodes that make up the screenplay seem to be connected into a single story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21531">The title page even proclaims the script is really “three stories about one story.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21532">If Tarantino and Avary had not created those transitions, the script would have been disjointed and episodic and not worked as well as it does.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21533">As far as I’m concerned, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to write these transitional scenes that move the story forward and bridge time and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21534">Writing good transitions is also a very good way to solve a number of problems.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21535">Transitions have always been an integral part of the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21536">From the earliest days of silent movies the craft of filmmaking has always been the same: to tell a story in pictures, building it from beginning to end with little bits and pieces of film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21537">That’s what a screenplay is: a story told with pictures.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21538">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21539">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21540">, for example, the passage of time is handled incredibly well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21541">Only one shot is needed to tell us the passage of time: the large posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, and Raquel Welch visually indicate that several decades have passed by. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21542">That, and some music on the soundtrack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21543">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21544">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21545"> a young woman of twenty-six is kneeling down looking at a book and we hear her in voice-over narration: “How do two separate people fuse into this thing called a couple? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21546">And if your love is that strong, then how do you still keep a little room for yourself…?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21547">That’s what the whole film is about, and when Finn stands up, we match-cut to her as a little girl of five or six years standing up looking at the women in the quilting bee as her narration leads us directly into the story line.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21548">Why are transitions so important? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21549">Because when you’re reading a script, or seeing a movie, it has to flow smoothly across a time period that is usually not more than two hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21550">The story line has to be a seamless parade of images across the page or screen, and time becomes a relative phenomenon; days and years and decades can be condensed into seconds, a few seconds stretched into minutes, as a leap is made from one image to another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21551">That’s one of the things that make </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21552">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21553"> such a remarkable movie; the passage of time does not draw attention to itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21554">It becomes an integral part of the fabric of the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21555">Transitions can be as varied and as multiple as the colors in a kaleidoscope. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21556">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21557">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21558">, for example, the screenwriter, Ted Tally, generally plays the last line of one scene over the first line of the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21559">The dialogue is used to bridge time and action and shows one way that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21560">sound</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21561"> can be the link connecting two different scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21562">Tally ends one scene with a question, then opens the next scene by answering that question.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21563">This kind of overlapping transition scene has been done many times before, of course, most notably in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21564">Julia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21565">, Alvin Sargent’s Academy Award–winning screenplay adapted from Lillian Hellman’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21566">Pentimento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21567">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21568">But the way Tally approached his transitions pushes the boundaries of the medium in such a way that we’re not even aware of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21569">If you’re watching a movie and become aware of the visual transitions, or feel the “arty” influence of the director in each scene, chances are it’s not a very good film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21570">The style and sophistication of the transition is evolving all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21571">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21572">Lone Star</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21573">, John Sayles makes his transitions bridging time and action in a very unique way: he has the characters remain in present time, then pans the camera over to a character or a place and suddenly we have moved across time, either forward or backward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21574">It’s very effective, extremely visual, and I think shows the remarkable versatility of Sayles as a writer and director.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21582">Every screenplay has its own particular style and form in terms of transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21583">An action film usually has short, quick transitions, because the film moves forward at a very rapid pace and we have to be swept up into the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21584">But in a character-driven piece the transitions could possibly come from silence, or looks between the characters, or dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21585">There is never </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21586">any one right way</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21587"> to make transitions. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21588">The only criterion is whether it works or not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21589">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21590">There may be times when you’re so engrossed in putting the story down on paper that you don’t even think about the transitional flow of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21591">But when you finish the first or second draft, you find that you’ve written a screenplay that may be 145 pages or longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21592">During the actual screenwriting process that’s okay, but afterward you’re going to have to do a lot of work to cut it to a proper length. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21593">A 140-plus page screenplay is only accepted if it’s by William Goldman, Quentin Tarantino, David Koepp, or Eric Roth.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21594">If your screenplay is too long, and you feel there’s too much going on, too many things happening, or too many characters, look for ways to bridge the time and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21595">Transitions solve so many problems in screenwriting and sometimes the bridge to another time, or another place, can be as simple as changing the character’s clothes, or using match cuts, or changing the weather, or using holidays to condense the time and action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21596">One of the most interesting films to use transitions as an integral part of the story is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21597">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21598">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21599">This is a unique film in many respects, but what’s especially interesting is the way Tarantino and Roger Avary created the transitions to keep the film flowing smoothly in one single time line.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21613">Because of the transitions.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21614">All the transitions in this screenplay are character driven, and the reason the film works so effectively is that the three stories are woven together with these characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21615">Even though it is “three stories about one story,” the focal point always seems to be Vincent, the John Travolta character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21616">The film opens in the restaurant with Tim Roth—Pumpkin—and his girlfriend, Honeybunny (Amanda Plummer); they pull out their guns and the robbery begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21617">We freeze at this point, then cut to Vincent and Jules driving somewhere having one of their many weighty and lengthy discussions about the difference between McDonald’s restaurants here and abroad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21618">They seem like two nice guys until they open the trunk, pull out several guns, and make their way inside an apartment building. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21619">Their actions seem to contradict their dialogue, which makes them interesting and colorful characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21620">They walk up the stairs, stake out a room, all the time continuing their discussion about the moral and ethical complications of a “foot massage.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21621">Especially Marcellus’s wife Mia’s foot massage which left the “masseur” with a very “severe speech problem.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21622">It is this attitude of casual nonchalance that is so effective in the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21623">There have been all kinds of essays and comments and literary debates about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21624">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21625">, and they reveal the extent to which movies have become the social fingerprints of our time.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21644">She has forgotten the gold watch at his apartment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21645">Furious, he realizes he must go back and retrieve it, even though it may cost him his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21646">He has double-crossed Marcellus and he knows there will be a contract on him (executed by Vincent and Jules). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21647">Sure enough, when he returns to the apartment, and retrieves the sacred watch, Vincent emerges from the bathroom and Butch blows him away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21648">Which is perhaps the most arresting moment in the film, because the scene is out of its normal time frame. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21649">It’s a nonlinear action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21650">And, occurring as it does in the middle of the script, it breaks the normal linear thread of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21651">This “nonlinear” structure is what has been so instrumental in the success of the film, and become the inspiration for many others coming up in the latter part of the nineties.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21652">Butch escapes in his little VW and at a stoplight sees Marcellus and literally runs over him in his efforts to get away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21653">In the ensuing somewhat comedic escape, both men are captured by two goon brothers, Ned and Zed, who lock them up in order to sodomize them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21654">Butch escapes, but decides he cannot let Marcellus remain in the hands of these two goonies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21655">He rescues him, again at the peril of his own life, and when Marcellus grants him a pardon, he promises to leave with his girlfriend, never to be seen again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21656">As Mia and Vincent have agreed to reveal nothing about what happened at dinner, Marcellus and Butch make an agreement not to say anything about this incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21657">Life is a compromise.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21658">Which then brings us to the third story, “Vincent, Jules, Jimmie, and the Wolf,” though in the film the title’s been changed to “The Bonnie Situation.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21659">Bonnie is Jimmie’s wife, the nurse who is expected home within the hour. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21660">And Jimmie (played by Tarantino) is not going to jeopardize his marriage by his wife finding a dead man in the garage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21661">It’s a situation that needs to be handled by the Wolf, the Harvey Keitel character whom we heard Marcellus mention at the end of the previous story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21662">The story begins at the end of the opening section after the Prologue, in what is really an overlapping scene from another point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21663">When Jules kills the first man, the character Brett, whom we have not seen before, has been in the bathroom, a gun in hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21664">He listens to Jules spouting the Bible in the living room and then we hear gunshots. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21665">Muttering to himself, Brett leaps out of the bathroom firing six times at Jules and Vincent and misses each time; the bullets thud harmlessly into the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21666">As Jules says, “It’s a fuckin’ miracle,” and he becomes obsessed with the fact that they’re still alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21667">“This is some serious shit,” he says as they drive away, the other character, Marvin, being held “captive” in the backseat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21668">They become engrossed in an illuminating conversation, Jules declaring that they’ve survived “only by divine intervention”; Vincent disagrees, and when he turns to get Marvin’s opinion, the gun he’s holding accidentally fires and Marvin’s head is blown all over the car.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21669">In a panic Jules calls his friend Jimmie and they go there to clean up the car and get rid of the body. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21670">A quick call to Marcellus produces “The Wolf,” and he comes to their rescue and saves the day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21671">The job done, the body and the car both disposed of, the two of them are hungry and go get some breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21672">That, of course, is the transition that leads to the coffee shop that Tim Roth and his girlfriend are going to rob. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21673">As they are having breakfast and continuing their discussion, Vincent goes to the bathroom, and when he’s gone the robbery begins, so we begin this action a little bit before it ended in the Prologue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21674">Another nice use of nonlinear structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21675">The two of them thwart the holdup, permit Pumpkin and Honeybunny to leave, and then leave themselves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21676">The end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21677">This nonlinear structure works very well within the framework of the three stories, Epilogue, and Prologue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21678">It is really what makes the film so interesting and appealing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21679">Just for the sake of an exercise we could put these three stories, along with the Prologue and Epilogue, into a linear story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21680">We might open with Vincent and Jules on their way to kill the kids who were trying to rip off Marcellus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21681">They leave, accidentally kill Marvin, go to the “Jules, Vincent, Jimmie, and the Wolf” sequence, which would be followed by their breakfast, leading to the Prologue and Epilogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21682">We follow them to the Marcellus bar scene of the first story, where Vincent and Butch meet; we would follow Vincent to Mia and their night out, then end with Butch and the gold watch, with Vinnie’s death and Butch’s escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21683">Yes, it would work, but it certainly would not be as effective as it is now.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21684">It is the transitions between these stories that really hold it all together; they make the screenplay work, bridging both linear time and narrative line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21685">All the characters are introduced and set up from the beginning, and these characters are the links that connect the three stories, even though they are told in a nonlinear way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21686">The “wackiness” of the characters (their discussions and the dialogue are wonderful), along with the bizarre humor of the stories, makes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21687">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21688"> the entertaining and highly influential film it is and, I think, will continue to be.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21689">Different kinds of films require different kinds of transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21690">An action or action-adventure film like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21691">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21692"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21693">Mission: Impossible</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21694"> (David Koepp and Robert Towne), requires swift transitions, sharp, dynamic bridges that keep the pace flowing fast and smooth, so the reader and viewer are swept into a torrent of movement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21695">Look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21696">Twister</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21697">, simply a one-line story of storm chasers; it is the four storm sequences that really hold the film together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21698">So everything in the story acts as a transition leading into the next storm.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21699">A character piece, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21700">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21701"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21702">The Bridges of Madison County</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21703">, requires a different kind of transitional connection, a smooth and careful sculpting of transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21704">In a comedy the transitions from one scene to the next might be capped with one-liners, but they must be character driven or humor driven in order to move the story forward in a funny and seamless way.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21705">Transitions in a biographical or historical screenplay present a problem of selectivity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21706">How do you weave what might be a number of historical incidents into a 120-page screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21707">If you simply string the character’s life story, or a series of events, in chronological order, it becomes nothing more than a filmed essay; first this happens, then that happens, then this other thing happens, and so on until the character dies or something significant takes place that leads to an ending we already know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21708">As in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21709">Nixon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21710">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21711">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21712">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21713">Gandhi</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21714">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21715">Recently I had the opportunity of working with a Brazilian writer-director on a screenplay about the famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21716">The writer did not want simply to show a biographical chronology of events, so he chose to write the screenplay like a free-association collage, fragmented bits and pieces of the composer’s life presented in a nonlinear fashion like some kind of visual jigsaw puzzle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21717">That way, he explained to me, he hoped to make the composer’s life both visual and interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21718">But, he confided, he felt very insecure about the script; he didn’t know whether it worked or not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21719">When I first read the material I thought it an interesting presentation, but unfortunately, the script didn’t work; it was a hard and difficult read because I didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21720">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21721"> was going on; I didn’t know what the story was about and it was hard to get a grasp of the main character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21722">My problem was “how to fix it,” how to keep the writer’s style and subject matter intact but also to tell the story of the composer, the subject of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21723">At first I thought this was a structural problem, but when I went back over the material, trying to isolate and define the historical moments of the character’s life, I realized that the main character seemed to disappear off the page; that’s when I realized that it was really a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21724">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21725">, because the events of his life seemed to overshadow him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21726">The women in his life seemed to dominate him, the smaller characters seemed larger than he was, and there seemed to be too many events going on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21727">When I took it apart, I saw the screenplay really focused on five major periods of the composer’s life, and it was these “parts” that were broken up and placed in various sections of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21728">I had the impression that the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21729">main character got lost on the page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21730">, for he literally disappeared from the action, even though it was his story and he was the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21731">The main character always seemed to be reacting to the events of his life, and not creating them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21732">The main character in a screenplay always has to be active; he or she must </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21733">cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21734"> things to happen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21735">A biographical film like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21736">Gandhi</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21737">, for example, covers only a few events of his life, yet the conflict the character confronts and endures is encapsulated in two or three events and they become the structural foundation the script is built upon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21738">The film covers only three major periods in Gandhi’s life: as a young attorney fighting for social causes; then formulating and embracing his philosophy and practice of “passive resistance”; then trying to mend the Hindu-Muslim disputes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21739">Gandhi’s murder and death “bookend” the film, very much like the bookend Prologue and Epilogue in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21740">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21741">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21742">The Brazilian script, as fragmented as it was, really dealt with these five periods of the composer’s life: his childhood, his struggles to get his music performed; the two women in his life; his world fame; and his final acceptance of old age.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21743">As I started going through the script again, I found that I could isolate and define these five areas of his life, but there seemed to be several key scenes missing, scenes needed to highlight and accent those periods of the composer’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21744">And it was these key scenes, I felt—discovering the source of his inspiration, meeting his second wife, overcoming those incredible obstacles to get his music performed, and so on—which became the Plot Points, or anchors, the basic glue that held the script together.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21745">Good transitions in a screenplay should never really be noticed; they should disappear into the visual narrative like the individual threads that make up a piece of cloth.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21746">Transitions become an essential tool in the Problem-Solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21747">If your script is too long, look for whole chunks of action, or full sequences, to omit and then find some kind of transition to tie the remainder together and bridge the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21748">Sometimes you can cover a longer period of time by using a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21749">montage</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21750">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21751">A montage is a sequence, a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21752">The purpose of a montage is to cover a lot of time, or a lot of events, in a very short period of time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21753">In the Brazilian screenplay we used several montages in order to move the story forward quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21754">We numbered the shots: 1) walking along the beach; 2) at dinner alone; 3) working hard at the piano, sheet music spread all around him on the floor; 4) walking into an office; 5) in another office arguing violently with a short, fat bureaucrat, wearing different clothes from the previous shot; 6) walking angrily out of another building, on another day, wearing the same crumpled suit with a different tie, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21755">The montage served a very specific purpose within the screenplay, yet conceived as one single action carried out over a period of several days.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21756">Perhaps the best transition ever put on film was the marriage montage in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21757">Citizen Kane</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21758"> (Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21759">The sequence starts after the marriage of Kane and his first wife, as they sit at the breakfast table having an intimate conversation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21760">There is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21761">swish pan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21762"> (the camera swishes out the frame) and we see them in different clothes talking and reading the paper. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21763">Swish Pan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21764"> and we see them at a slightly larger table having a very heated discussion. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21765">Swish Pan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21766"> to them having a more vocal argument about him spending so much time at the office. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21767">Swish Pan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21768"> to them at a much larger table, both silent, both reading the paper; she asks him something and he simply grunts a reply. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21769">Swish Pan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21770"> to them at a very long table eating in total silence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21771">It tells us so much in so little, using pictures instead of words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21772">It’s an incredible sequence that is probably the best portrait of the disintegration of a marriage ever conceived.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22247">There are times during the screenwriter’s journey when the story works well, with a tense and dramatic plot, and all the characters seem to have interesting backgrounds, but there’s a nagging sense that the dialogue is thin, maybe “tinny,” filled with clichés, and doesn’t seem to go anywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22248">Something seems not to be working, and you really can’t put your finger on what it is; maybe you’ve had the script read by a few friends or associates, and they tell you they “like it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22249">When you press them further, more often than not they point to the dialogue and say it may need polishing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22250">You hear this quite a bit in Hollywood, especially among development executives, and when they encounter this problem their solution is to bring in another writer to rewrite the dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22251">Writing is rewriting, and sometimes as many as twelve writers are brought in to “hone and polish” the project.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22252">Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22253">The Rock</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22254"> is a case in point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22255">The original screenplay, written by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook, was a really strong screenplay in terms of plot and character, it was just the dialogue that seemed to be flat and one-dimensional and didn’t seem to be working as well as it could. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22256">It had an exciting premise, good characters, interesting backgrounds, and pretty obviously had the potential to be a good “thump-and-pump” movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22257">Another writer, Mark Rosner, was brought in to rewrite the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22258">He did a draft and that is what attracted the director, Michael Bay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22259">But when Bay came on the project he thought the dialogue needed more of a “spin,” so he brought in Jonathan Hensleigh to make it more contemporary and bring it up to date.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22260">Hensleigh worked hand in hand with the director for months, honing and polishing the dialogue, and was on the set every day just in case he was needed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22261">When the film was completed the credits were established, and then the screenplay went to the arbitration panel at the Writers Guild of America. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22262">The panel consists of three screenwriters, independent of each other, who read the screenplay from the inception to the final draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22263">Each writer’s contribution is measured and analyzed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22264">In some cases the arbitration panel will read fifteen different drafts of the screenplay, contrasting and comparing each one with the final product. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22265">Then they’ll award the screenwriting credits based on how they see each writer’s contribution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22266">In the case of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22267">The Rock</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22268"> it was determined that the original writers should get the screen credit, and not Jonathan Hensleigh.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22269">That decision sparked a real debate within the creative community. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22270">The director was outraged, as were a number of other people in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22271">He insisted that Hensleigh receive a credit, and rightfully so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22272">Didn’t rewriting the dialogue warrant a screen credit?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22273">Yes and no.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22274">The Writers Guild of America, the WGA, has determined that a screenwriter can only receive a screenwriting credit if he or she has rewritten fifty percent or more of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22275">So when a new writer is brought in he or she, in most cases, will alter the structure, add new locations, create new scenes and characters, while trying to keep, hopefully, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22276">idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22277"> of the screenplay that was originally purchased by the studio or production company.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22278">What’s the point of all this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22279">Dialogue is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22280">function of character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22281">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22282">It’s true that some writers have a better ear for writing dialogue than others; they’re just born with a natural talent and ability, and it’s really a gift. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22283">But if you know your character well enough, if you feel comfortable inside his or her skin, the dialogue will be individual and appropriate and capture the “essence” of that character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22284">The dialogue may not be that great, but it’ll still work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22285">The function of dialogue, remember, is simple; dialogue either moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22286">You can say things, explain things, or show things in order to reveal character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22287">If you look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22288">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22289">, most of the symptoms listed there deal with dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22290">After all, dialogue is one of the most striking qualities about your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22291">It tells us who he or she is, sets up the exposition, moves the story forward, adds humor, and can be one of the elements used in transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22292">If you think your dialogue is too thin, or your characters all sound alike, or if you explain too much, the best way to solve the problem is to go back to the beginning and rethink your character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22293">One of the ways to accomplish this is by doing an exercise I call the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22294">“Circle of Being.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22295"> It’s a process, really, a process that allows you uncover some kind of an incident or event in your character’s life that emotionally parallels and impacts the story line; it’s an event that happens to your main character when he or she is between the ages of ten and sixteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22296">This is an age period where some kind of traumatic event could conceivably occur that would affect the entire course of your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22297">It might be the death of a parent, or of a loved one; it could be physical abuse that results in a deep emotional scar; it could be a physical event or injury, or quite possibly a move to a new city or country.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22298">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22299"> is a very good example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22300">As Louise was growing up in Texas she was raped and discovered she was unable to get justice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22301">It was this incident that “formed” her behavior and ultimately led to the incident that powers the entire story line, the shooting of the rapist Harlan in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22302">It explains why she pulled the trigger in the first place, and why she wouldn’t set one foot inside the state of Texas.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22303">If you think about it, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22304">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22305"> is a valuable exercise, or a tool, that you can use in crafting, enriching, and enhancing your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22306">If you go into your character’s life and ask yourself what traumatic incident might have occurred to him or her between the ages of ten and sixteen, see what happens.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22307">Why ten and sixteen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22308">Because it happens to be a very important age in a person’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22309">The noted behaviorist Joseph Chilton Pierce states that there are four major growths, or spurts, of human intelligence in our lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22310">The first occurs when the child is about a year old, when he or she learns to walk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22311">The second spurt occurs about age four, when the child learns that he or she has an identity, as a boy or a girl, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22312">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22313"> has a given name; when the four-year-old acts, there is a response, and at that age he/she belongs to a family, and these are his/her parents and he/her lives in this house in this city. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22314">At this age, the child is able to communicate his or her needs.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22315">The third stage, or spurt, in the growth of human intelligence occurs when the child is about nine or ten; that’s the age when he or she understands that he has a definite personality, a singular and individual voice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22316">The young person is learning to question authority, forming his or her own opinions, and starting “speaking his mind.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22317">This is a very vital time in the life of the child.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22318">The fourth stage in the growth of human intelligence, and the most important developmental spurt, according to Pierce, occurs when the person is about fifteen or sixteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22319">The teenager. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22320">That’s the age when the teenager rebels against everything and tries to find his/her own voice, suddenly understands that his parents are no longer the center of the universe, and looks outward into the world for role models, seeking forms of behavior, like clothes or hair, that are acceptable to his peers and express who they are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22321">They have an identity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22322">Just look at your own kids, or your brother’s or sister’s kids or your friends’ kids, and look at how they dress, how they act and react, what kind of music they’re listening to, their slang and manner of speaking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22323">It’s a period of life that is so influential in a person’s life that it will form a subconscious identity, or impression, for the rest of their life, much as furniture leaves impressions in the rug. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22324">Take a moment to see how strong this impression is in your own life; close your eyes and go back to that time when you were about fifteen or sixteen, and see what incident or event affected you the most. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22325">What was the incident or event that springs to mind? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22326">If you want, play some music from that time and see what memories it brings up, and then take a moment to see how some particular incident from that period has affected you and possibly changed your life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22327">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22328">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22329"> is a wonderful tool that lets you dig into the emotional substance and dimension of your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22330">Just look how it affected Louise; when Callie Khouri wrote the screenplay, she did not refer to the incident at all except to state that Louise had no intention whatsoever of stepping one foot inside Texas, no matter what the reason. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22331">But the director, Ridley Scott, thought the audience should know about this event and how it triggered Louise’s actions, so he had Khouri make a few references to the incident; Hal, the Harvey Keitel character, even told her, “I know what happened in Texas,” and Thelma guesses that “it happened to you, didn’t it?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22332">referring to the rape attempt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22333">To the very end Louise never responds to this.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22334">This incident is the reason for Louise to stubbornly insist that they’re not going to cross the Texas state line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22335">Because the only way to get to Mexico without going through Texas is to go through Oklahoma, the decision ultimately costs them their lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22336">This </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22337">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22338"> incident is relived in the parking lot when she sees Harlan attempting to rape Thelma, and she totally loses it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22339">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22340"> is an extraordinary film, but many writers I’ve talked to didn’t like it for this very reason; they say Louise “overreacted” by shooting Harlan, and could not “willingly suspend their disbelief” enough to get into the story after that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22341">But I think they didn’t get that it was really the sixteen- or eighteen-year-old rape victim Louise who pulled that trigger, not Louise in present time.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22342">If you can go back into your character’s life and create an incident or event that becomes an influence or a force working on your character, you can enhance the texture of any character you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22343">By creating the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22344">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22345"> you can generate a plot complication that will expand the depth and dimension of your character and literally drive the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22346">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22347">Twister</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22348"> the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22349">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22350"> incident is shown in the opening sequence, when Helen Hunt’s father is swept out of the storm cellar; it is the incident that motivates her to become a “storm chaser.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22351">One of my students, a well-known and working playwright, wanted to make the switch from writing for the stage to writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22352">He had an interesting story that involved the reconciliation of two sisters after an absence of many years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22353">The story opens when the main character, who happens to be a dentist, accidentally injures her teeth, and to correct the problem she must undergo a dental procedure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22354">While she’s under the influence of the anesthesia she flashes back to the time when she was a young girl and witnessed her sister being raped by their uncle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22355">Fearful of being seen, she runs away and in her flight trips over a rock, falls, and hits her front teeth, the same teeth that are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22356">acting up now</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22357">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22358">She had totally repressed the memory of this incident and it leads her to pursue a reconciliation with her sister. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22359">It was the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22360">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22361"> event that sparked the entire story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22362">By forcing herself to confront and deal with this incident that took place in her past, she begins to look at her life and sees that she must mend her relationship with her sister. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22363">It’s a powerful moment during the screenplay, and I suggested to the writer that we see visual bits and pieces of this incident throughout the story as it unfolds, so he began to weave and incorporate this visual memory throughout the body of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22364">It turned out to be very powerful material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22365">I call this process the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22366">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22367"> because if you picture your character as a circle and then section him/her off, as you would divide a piece of pie, you section off the physical, emotional, mental, and intellectual incidents or events that make up the fabric of your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22368">In this way you can create a well-rounded portrait of your character, and then everything you do—all the emotions, thoughts, and feelings you dramatize—works to expand your characterization.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22392">Willy is asking Howard, the son, for a job on the floor, and first he asks for $65 a week, then drops his request to $50 a week, and then, in his final humiliation, he is literally forced to beg for $40 a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22393">But this “is a business, kid, and everybody’s gotta pull his own weight,” and Willy Loman’s sales figures have not been the best lately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22394">Willy responds by retreating into his memory and tells Howard what drew him to become a salesman: “When I was a boy—eighteen, nineteen,” he says, “—I was already on the road. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22395">And there was a question in my mind as to whether selling had a future for me….”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22396">He pauses for a long moment, then continues on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22397">[That’s when] “I met a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22398">salesman</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22399"> in the Parker House. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22400">His name was Dave Singleman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22401">And he was eighty-four years old, and he’d drummed merchandise in thirty-one states. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22402">And old Dave, he’d go up to his room, y’ understand, put on his green velvet slippers—I’ll never forget—and pick up his phone and call the buyers, and without ever leaving his room, at the age of eighty-four, he made his living. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22403">And when I saw that, I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22404">’Cause what could be more satisfying than to be able to go, at the age of eighty-four, into twenty or thirty different cities, and pick up a phone, and be remembered and loved and helped by so many different people? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22405">Do you know when he died—and by the way he died the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22406">death of a salesman</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22407">, in his green velvet slippers in the smoker of the New York, New Haven and Hartford, going into Boston—hundreds of salesmen and buyers were at his funeral.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22408">That’s Willy Loman’s dream; that’s what drives him to get up every morning and hit the road, and when that dries up, the dream is dead and life is not worth living. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22409">That’s the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22410">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22411"> experience in Willy’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22412">Remember Andy Dufresne’s line in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22413">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22414">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22415">“Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22416">But if the dream collides with reality, as in the case of Willy Loman, and all hope is lost, then what’s left? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22417">The death of a salesman.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22418">That’s the force and the power of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22419">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22420">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22421">Once you’ve created an experience or an incident that affects the life of your character, then you can base the emotional arc on that incident and have the character confront and resolve (or not resolve) the experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22422">It becomes a way of embellishing the depth and dimension of character, to create a strong and defined point of view and attitude, and contains within it the spark of conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22423">Recently, I was commissioned to oversee the writing of a screenplay about a Native American warrior from the Oneida Nation, one of the six member nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, called the “Longhouse,” and their divided loyalties between the American colonists and the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22424">The main character is forced, literally against his will, into a situation where he has to align himself with the colonists in their war against the British. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22425">The immediate result, which is historically accurate, was a situation in which brother fought against brother, family against family; the ultimate result, unfortunately, was the confiscation of the Indian lands, the entire Northeastern part of the U.S., by the American government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22426">It’s a story of divided loyalties, a story of fate and destiny, and based on a historical incident.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22427">But the facts of this warrior’s life were thin, almost nonexistent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22428">What was known was that he sided with the colonists, but why he did so was never answered, and that was a question that had to be answered dramatically.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22429">This was the situation: It is well known historically that the Iroquois Confederacy wanted to remain neutral in this conflict; the elders declared that a war of this kind, a war of rebellion, was like an argument between a father and son. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22430">And anyone who takes sides in this kind of conflict becomes party to a no-win situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22431">If the Confederacy sided with the British, in this case the father, and the son was defeated and lay broken and bleeding on the battlefield, the father would hate the people who had done it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22432">On the other hand, if the Confederacy sided with the son, the colonists, and the father was vanquished and suffering in defeat, the Indian nations would alienate all their British friends. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22433">So the best thing to do, they decided, was to stay neutral.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22434">So that’s what they did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22435">Until the British army, bearing gifts of rum and trinkets, persuaded a prominent member of the Mohawk nation to join them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22436">He then convinced several of his brothers to side with the British. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22437">And, when the British army started their march toward Albany, they were aided by these Mohawk warriors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22438">In their first battle they attacked a colonial fort where the Oneida women and children, their cousins, had taken refuge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22439">Historically, that’s correct. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22440">Again, would that action alone make the Oneida warrior align himself with the colonists?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22441">Not necessarily so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22442">My partner in this project didn’t really know how to solve this particular situation, so I suggested that she create a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22443">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22444"> for the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22445">I told her to start from the character’s life and the known historical facts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22446">The warrior was born the son of an Oneida woman and a German settler. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22447">So what event might have happened to the main character during his youth, say, around the age of fifteen?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22448">If you look at the significance of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22449">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22450">, it can be a defining incident that embraces all those internal, external, emotional, physical, and background forces working on the character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22451">What kind of incident would make the warrior turn against his own friends and relatives? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22452">There are many answers to this question, of course, but one particular solution (a created, dramatic incident) worked very well; when the warrior was a young man, say about fifteen, he watched his father die at the hands of some drunken British soldiers, and then they burned their meager crops and the houses they were living in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22453">Contrived? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22454">Yes, but historically, it was not all that uncommon for an incident like this to happen, especially at that time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22455">In dramatic terms it worked very well, and it’s an incident that really doesn’t have to be explained during the screenplay, as long as the writer </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22456">knows</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22457"> it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22458">In this case the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22459">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22460"> incident is referred to only once, and all the emotional choices and decisions the character makes follow from that significant event.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22461">Some films use the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22462">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22463"> as the basis of the entire story line, and it becomes the subject of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22464">I was at a prerelease screening of a film entitled </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22465">Loved</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22466"> (written and directed by Erin Dignam), starring Robin Wright and William Hurt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22467">It’s the story of a young woman who had been entangled in a mentally and physically abusive relationship some six years before the story began. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22468">She was sixteen then and it was her first “serious” relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22469">She managed to extricate herself from her lover, but in the years following the relationship, the man became involved with two other women, and in one of these relationships the woman suffered a broken leg and hip at the man’s hands. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22470">In the other relationship, in the scene that opens the film, the man and woman are in a heavy discussion next to a crowded highway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22471">The man turns and walks away, and the woman races directly into the path of a speeding car and is killed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22472">The DA’s office wants to bring a charge of manslaughter against the man, and to fortify their case they want the Robin Wright character to testify, so a preliminary hearing is held. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22473">During the time she is on the stand, she has to relive the relationship, confront it, and deal with it; in the end she accepts her share of responsibility for the abuse she suffered and frees herself from it, and the last scene shows her ready to resume her life and hopefully enter into a more positive and loving relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22474">Sometimes a bad or abusive relationship is better than none at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22475">From the character’s perspective the physical abuse she received from this man demonstrated how much he loved her.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22476">It’s a good illustration of how the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22477">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22478"> generates an entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22479">If you take a look at the problems described on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22480">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22481">, many of them can be directly solved by creating a strong </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22482">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22483"> incident for the main character.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22496">It is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22497">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22498"> event. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22499">Because of her father’s death she was sent away to live with an uncle in Montana. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22500">One night she was awakened by the screaming of lambs being slaughtered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22501">So she tried to rescue one of the baby lambs, but was caught and sent away to live in an orphanage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22502">It is Hannibal Lecter’s forcing her to look at this emotional issue that ultimately frees her of it, and at the end of the film she can build a new life, both in a committed relationship as well as in her job as a top-notch FBI agent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22503">But only when she can confront this incident of the past, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22504">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22505">, can she be free. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22506">It’s exactly the same with Louise in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22507">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22508">, except Louise never gave up holding on to the rape and it literally cost her her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22509">But Clarice, under the tutelage of Lecter, was strong enough to be able to surrender to it, deal with it, and let it go.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22510">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22511"> ends with Clarice receiving her diploma, and at the reception following her graduation she receives a phone call from Hannibal Lecter asking “if the lambs have stopped screaming….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22512">And then he shares his “admiration” for her by telling her that “I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22513">Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22514">He is the first to acknowledge Clarice’s transformation from the trainee with an incomplete childhood into a trained professional, ready to fly.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22515">So if you feel that your character is too thin and one-dimensional, too passive or too reactive, or speaks in dialogue that is too direct or explanatory, one way to solve the problem is to go back and explore his or her life in terms of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22516">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22517">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22569">How often have you read something you’ve written and, much to your chagrin, found that the writing seems to be flat, the characters thin and one-dimensional, and as much as you want to deny it, or as much as you defend it, you cannot escape the cold, hard fact that everything you’ve written seems to be dull, thin, and boring? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22570">When you think about all the time and effort you’ve spent and all the sacrifice and denial you’ve had to endure, to end up with pages like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22571">this</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22572">—oh, Lord!</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22582">That’s one solution, and it may work in some screenplays, at least for a little while. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22583">So you decide to add some new scenes and a new character to liven up the action, but when you sit down to reread the material, you suddenly notice something else isn’t working and you get that sinking feeling in the gut that you really haven’t fixed the material, you’ve just put a Band-Aid over it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22584">Given it a paint job.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22590">What usually happens when you’re trapped in this scenario is that your confusion gives rise to frustration, which then funnels up into anger, then smothers you in a blanket of despair and depression, and the ultimate result is that you just give up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22591">It’s all part of the writer’s journey.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22637">This little scene reveals so much about Book’s character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22638">What makes it work so well is that within the body of the scene they’re doing something, eating, putting mustard and ketchup on the dogs, not just sitting around talking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22639">Even this little action of eating reveals the different points of view between these two characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22640">And two different points of view is the first step in generating a substantial source of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22641">In this case it represents a different way of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22642">As the boy and his mother bless their food, Book just wolfs it down, and so illuminates visually the difference between them.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22733">First, change the style of your writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22734">Don’t try to write complete, literary sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22735">Focus on short, descriptive passages, maybe one-word sentences, where the words are used to accentuate color and humor to the reader. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22736">Shane Black (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22737">Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22738">, among others) uses dynamic and imaginative writing in his work; for example, in a car-chase sequence with the cars squirreling through traffic and racing down sidewalks scattering pedestrians, the cars scrape each other; and the way he describes it is short, visual, and concise: “The cars trade paint.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22739">It’s a great way to convey the thrill of the chase.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22852">First, some practical pointers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22853">Nothing turns a reader off more than having to read thick and dense single-line paragraphs that fill up half to three quarters of a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22854">To support the reader, make sure your descriptive paragraphs are not longer than four or five sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22855">If you’ve laced your script with long descriptive paragraphs, break them up into shorter paragraphs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22856">Make sure the descriptive prose is not too “thick,” or “dense”; a good screenplay should have a lot of white space on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22857">You don’t have to cut the material, just break it up into new paragraphs every four or five sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22858">So many times a screenwriter will write a thick descriptive paragraph that fills up most of the page and it just stops the reading process cold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22859">Lean, clean, and tight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22860">That’s what you want in your screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22861">What else can you do to remove the element of “boring”?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22862">Check your writing style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22863">You want to write in an active, present-tense style, so make your descriptive sentences shorter, tighter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22864">Check the dialogue; is it too wordy, too long, and too explanatory? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22865">Cut it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22866">Be ruthless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22867">Either dialogue moves the story forward or it reveals character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22868">If it doesn’t satisfy these two requirements, cut it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22869">After you’ve done this, see if there are places in the text where you can add some kind of action, either a car chase or a kiss; just know that whatever action you choose has to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22870">fit within the fabric of your story line</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22871">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22872">Obviously, you can’t add something without reason, or something that doesn’t fit, or something that’s completely out of context. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22873">If you check your material carefully you might find a few places where an action sequence, or some humor, might help to relieve the heaviness or density of the reading experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22874">After you’ve made that assessment, move into individual scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22875">Are there places where your characters are just talking heads, sitting in a restaurant, driving a car, or walking through a park? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22876">What are they doing during the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22877">What’s happening around them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22878">For example, if they’re sitting in a restaurant having an intense conversation, give them something to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22879">Let them be eating shrimp, for example, or corn on the cob, or let a tooth chip or break; or let the character be coming down with a cold; try to add something to the detail of the scene that the characters have to deal with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22880">If your characters are driving in a car, let another driver cut them off and maybe the driver overreacts, so you’ve now got two things going on at the same time; the conversation as well as the reaction to the other driver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22881">This adds depth and tension to the action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22882">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22883">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22884">, when Andy Dufresne has locked himself in the warden’s office and is playing the operatic aria, the guards and warden are banging on the door. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22885">Two different things are going on simultaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22886">So look for ways to incorporate any kind of secondary action into your scenes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22887">When Andy makes contact with Red for the first time, Red is playing catch with a baseball and this action continues through the entire scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22888">Give your characters something to do during the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22889">You don’t have to explain anything, just show it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22890">There will be times when a dialogue scene isn’t working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22891">No matter what you do, or how many times you change the character’s lines, the scene just doesn’t seem to gel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22892">If this is the case, there are a few things you can do: number one, go into the scene and clarify its elements. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22893">Define the purpose of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22894">What is the dramatic need of the main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22895">What does he or she want during the scene; what is he or she doing there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22896">Where did the character come from before the scene began? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22897">Where is he or she going after the scene is over? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22898">You don’t have to write this information into the scene, or explain it, but you, the writer, must know it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22899">Don’t assume anything; clarify and define the character’s dramatic need until there’s no question in your mind about what happened before the scene began and what’s going to happen after it’s over.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22900">If the scene or sequence still isn’t working, there’s something else you can do: switch the lines of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22901">If Bill’s the main character and he’s in the scene with his ex-girlfriend, Sally, and he wants something from her, some information, or a package, whatever, simply switch the lines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22902">Give Bill’s lines to Sally and Sally’s lines to Bill and see what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22903">If that doesn’t work, rewrite the scene and change the character’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22904">If Bill is the main character, and Sally is a major or minor character, write the scene from Sally’s point of view and let Bill be the secondary character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22905">That means you have to enter the scene from Sally’s point of view and see the purpose of the scene through her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22906">This is an amazing little exercise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22907">It removes any resistance you might have to the scene, and somehow dissolves the blocks that keep it from working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22908">Once you’ve written the scene this way, go back and rewrite it from Bill’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22909">See what happens.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22910">These little things can literally change the tone and texture of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22911">They can add depth and dimension to the scenes so the reading experience does not end up being dull, thin, and boring.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22955">There are times during the screenwriting process when the main character seems to vanish, literally disappears off the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22956">No matter what the character does, either in terms of fulfilling the story’s action or in revealing information about himself/herself, the personality, the behavior, or the dramatic need vanishes and the character is lost within the matrix of the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22957">And then, at other times, a minor character suddenly emerges, developing such a strong and vibrant personality that he or she totally overshadows the main character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22958">I call this phenomenon the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22959">passive active</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22960">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22961">It’s where the main character seems to wander around looking for something to do, and, no matter what he or she does do, always reacts instead of acts, and is portrayed as passive instead of active.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22962">It can be a real problem, especially if your story line is built around this particular character and he/she gets lost in the narrative story line or seems to disappear off the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22963">One of the best ways of becoming aware of this problem is to evaluate the material and determine whether the main character is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22964">reacting</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22965"> to the situation or is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22966">actively creating</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22967"> it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22968">You’re writing for the visual medium. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22969">One of the strongest rules governing the craft is that your main character must be active, and be the catalyst of the action, the spark that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22970">causes</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22971"> things to happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22972">That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t let your character(s) react to a particular situation during the screenplay, just the opposite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22973">Characters are always reacting to events or forces that affect them.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22974">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22975">Three Days of the Condor</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22976"> (Lorenzo Semple and David Rayfiel), the Robert Redford character is literally “out to lunch” when the entire cell of his CIA unit (they read books looking for information) is wiped out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22977">When he discovers this, he understands it won’t be too long before the assassin comes after him, and he enters the Second Act not knowing what to do or whom to trust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22978">For the entire First Half of Act II the Redford character is only reacting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22979">It is only at the Mid-Point, about sixty pages in, that he kidnaps the Faye Dunaway character and begins to be active again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22980">And it works perfectly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22981">If you haven’t seen it in a while, check it out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22982">Action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22983"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22984">reaction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22985"> are two sides of the same coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22986">As a matter of fact, Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that “for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22987">It’s just something to be aware of, and it can be a good rule to follow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22988">If something happens to a character, if he or she is affected by an incident or event, the reaction is a normal part of character revelation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22989">It only becomes a problem when the character is reacting constantly, not only to an incident or event, but also to other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22990">Things always seem to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22991">happen</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22992"> to him/her; the character doesn’t cause or trigger them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22993">If you show your characters reacting too much of the time, they’ll simply disappear off the page or, as sometimes happens, disappear off the movie screen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22994">A few nights ago I was watching television, and a Steven Seagal movie, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22995">On Deadly Ground</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22996">, came on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22997">I started watching. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22998">This was a film that Seagal starred in as well as directed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22999">The film opens with some beautiful location shots of the Alaskan wilderness, and we cut to an oil well fire that’s burning out of control. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23000">A helicopter wings its way over the rugged country, bringing the Seagal character to the fire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23001">He lands, gets out, and approaches the team of firefighters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23002">They can’t handle it and they don’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23003">So what does the Seagal character do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23004">With only a few words he dons his fire suit and walks directly into the raging inferno. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23005">He stands there, surrounded by flames, casually plants some explosives, then just as casually walks out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23006">The other characters scatter, looking for cover, but the Seagal character simply stands there as the oil well explodes, putting out the fire.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23007">Pretty strong stuff, right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23008">Strong action, a strong character, and some powerful visual images. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23009">What I saw during the thirty or forty minutes I watched the film was that it was a perfect example of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23010">passive active</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23011">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23012">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23013">Because the portrayal of characters was so thin, the film became laughable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23014">Michael Caine, the fine English actor, played the mean and totally corrupt oil baron, but his performance (I’m sure it was written as it was played) was a one-dimensional, histrionic, over-the-top characterization of a man obsessed with carrying out his evil scheme.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23015">Opposing him, of course, was the good guy, Seagal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23016">The portrait of the Seagal character is the perfect expression of the passive active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23017">As the main character he’s the strong, silent type, a man who doesn’t talk too much, a man who wants to avoid trouble, except when pushed too far, and only then will he react and take action—and as we see, he’s a character who can literally do everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23018">Whether it’s putting out the oil fire single-handed, or being a master of martial arts, or breaking into a computer and uncovering secret passwords, or protecting the rights of a drunken and downtrodden Eskimo. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23019">He is a man who is reacting to the situations caused by others, the bad guys. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23020">And all this is shown in the first fifteen minutes, by the way!</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23021">The unscrupulous oil baron, the bad guy, and the Seagal character, the good guy, quickly square off and it’s pretty predictable who’s going to come out on top.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23022">It’s easy to see what Seagal and the writer were striving for here; they wanted to portray the Seagal character as the strong, silent type, but because we’re not privy to what he is thinking or feeling, he comes across as a character who only </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23023">reacts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23024"> to the events instigated by the Michael Caine character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23025">That makes him a reactive character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23026">Throughout the film the main character does not once instigate any actions, he only responds to actions initiated by someone else; so all we know about him is that he’s reacting to what’s happening to him and how it affects the tribal community of Eskimos.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23027">His character, portrayed as the strong and silent type, is a man who seemingly knows everything, is right about everything, and lives according to a strict moral code that came out of the early westerns of Tom Mix. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23028">He was so busy being the “good guy,” and reacting to the things the bad guys have done, that he becomes a boring character and literally disappears off the screen.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23029">For example, here’s a situation that is supposed to reveal an aspect of his character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23030">It’s a typical bar fight, and it could have been taken right out of a Tom Mix western. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23031">Seagal’s sitting in the bar, drinking alone at a table. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23032">Three big tough guys, oil riggers, are hassling a drunken Eskimo who wants another drink. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23033">They taunt him, then begin pushing and shoving him around until he collapses into a corner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23034">Seagal doesn’t do anything, he simply stares at them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23035">When they belligerently ask what he’s looking at, Seagal at first does not reply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23036">When they continue taunting him, he stands and the oil rig workers exchange words with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23037">Seagal walks toward them and, before they can continue talking, launches into them, throwing them all over the place, and in only a matter of minutes he reduces the oil workers, and there must be at least ten of them, into whimpering weaklings, begging and groveling for mercy.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23038">Ho-hum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23039">It’s pretty standard fare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23040">We’ve seen it hundreds of times, for it’s a predictable bar fight: the hero sits alone minding his own business when some tough guys pick on someone who can’t take care of himself, usually a drunk, and the hero steps in and rescues him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23041">What makes this interesting for our purposes is that the Seagal character is so passive, portraying an attitude rather than any emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23042">And that’s the way he is during the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23043">We don’t know anything about him, and all we see about this character is a strong, silent, passive attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23044">He becomes the passive active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23045">It’s not very interesting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23046">The screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader interested enough to keep turning pages, or in this case, keep my fingers off the remote. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23047">The real lesson to be learned in this case is that at no time do we know enough about Seagal to see or understand his thoughts, feelings, or emotions; all he reflects is his attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23048">His humanity, or believability, is all contained inside his head.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23049">That being the case, the only thing this kind of a character can do is react to the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23050">By placing a character in these types of situations, reacting to something someone else has initiated, the screenwriter causes his main character literally to vanish, to disappear off the page.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23051">In many of Robert Redford’s films he portrays this type of active/reactive character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23052">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23053">Sneakers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23054"> (Larry Lasker and Walter Parkes), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23055">Indecent Proposal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23056"> (Amy Holden Jones), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23057">Out of Africa</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23058"> (Kurt Luedtke). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23059">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23060">Sneakers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23061"> he plays a character who doesn’t show any thoughts or feelings, he simply states that he has a plan and then we see him implementing the plan and then he seems to disappear into the background. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23062">He is a passive yet active character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23063">So if you’re writing, or rewriting, a screenplay, and you sense that your character is washed out, or unseen on the page, or he or she is overshadowed by another character, or the story line seems contrived or predictable, or conflict seems to be missing, the chances are your character is too passive and is busy reacting to other characters or situations rather than creating or initiating the action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23064">One of the “rules” of screenwriting is that action is character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23065">It must be remembered that film is behavior, and what a person does, his or her actions, reveals who he or she is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23066">But there has to be a way for the reader to connect with the character; there must be a character-audience bond established for the script to be effective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23067">If this bond is not formed, then there’s a whole dimension missing in the illumination of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23068">And when that’s the case, there is no “willing suspension of disbelief.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23069">How do you go about solving the problem of the passive character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23070">First, it has to be approached from the perspective of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23071">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23072">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23073">A lot of writers try to solve the problem by approaching it through </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23074">Structure;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23075"> they seem to feel that if they can add enough action sequences, or tense dramatic moments, that will take care of the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23076">All that does, however, is accentuate the passivity of the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23077">Just like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23078">On Deadly Ground</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23079">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23080">It’s not enough to pile on a number of action sequences, because it doesn’t really solve the problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23081">So, how do you recognize the problem of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23082">passive/active</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23083">?</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23122">Which brings up another point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23123">Sometimes the screenwriter, wanting to avoid being too direct, or too “on target,” in the dialogue, tries to be a little too subtle, a little too indirect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23124">That creates a sense of confusion and a lack of understanding, so the needs of the character become lost in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23125">what the character is not saying</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23126">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23127">The dialogue seems vague and off center and the reader really doesn’t know what’s going on, and the story line seems to wander off in several directions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23128">It’s a symptom of the screenwriter’s wanting to be too clever.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23129">There are times in a screenplay when the dialogue has to be direct, for exposition purposes, in order to move the story forward, whether on a physical or an emotional level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23130">And sometimes these scenes are the hardest to write just because they are so direct and on the mark. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23131">They’re so easy, you think there’s something wrong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23132">This is where you don’t need subtlety of action or dialogue, you need clarity and definition to keep your character active and interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23133">The great American novelist F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23134">Scott Fitzgerald always felt that the hardest thing a writer has to do is to “write down” to his readers; what he meant by that was that it’s very hard to write material that is too specific and too direct, with no subtlety either in thought, action, or exposition.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23135">This happens all the time if you “try” to make your character alive and interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23136">If you think you’re really being smart and clever writing “indirect” dialogue, there’s a good chance the motivation and need of your character will simply wash out and disappear off the page, lost in the twilight zone between clarity and confusion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23137">That’s when another character will start to take over and become more interesting than the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23138">If you get the feeling a minor character is dominating or overshadowing the main character, and is more lively and more interesting, it’s a pretty good indication the main character might be too passive, and you’re going to have to strengthen the characterization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23139">It should be noted that there will be moments when your main character will be reacting to another character, action, or situation, and that’s not bad—it’s when reaction becomes his or her only response that it proves a detriment, and that’s why you have to be careful walking the line between action and reaction.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23140">A case in point is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23141">The Accidental Tourist</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23142">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23143">Adapted from the novel by Ann Tyler by screenwriter/director Lawrence Kasdan and Frank Galati, the film, starring William Hurt and Geena Davis, is a quirky comedy about a man who has recently lost his son in a senseless shooting in a mall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23144">William Hurt portrays a writer of travel books for people who detest traveling, and by nature he’s a character who is withdrawn and reclusive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23145">His only companion is his dog, who, it is understood, loves to travel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23146">They’re quite a pair together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23147">And when the Hurt character accepts a new assignment, he takes his dog to be boarded in a kennel and there meets the delightful and wacky Geena Davis character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23148">And she makes it her “mission” (her dramatic need) to bring him out of his shell because she’s looking to find a father for her own son.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23149">The novel is so unique that it poses major problems adapting it into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23150">In the first place you have a main character who’s divorced, alone, and reclusive, and the fact that he’s just lost his son in a senseless killing simply compounds the problem; his main action is moping around feeling sorry for himself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23151">This is very delicate material that works wonderfully on the printed page under the gifted talent of Ann Tyler. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23152">But translating this kind of material to the screen is very difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23153">If you want to visually portray a character reacting to the death of another person, you have to know from the beginning that the character’s gaze will be mostly focused inward, that he will be self-absorbed in grief and somewhat reluctant to engage in any kind of action, physical or emotional. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23154">This depends on the story of course, but in the case of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23155">The Accidental Tourist</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23156"> it’s a primary force that’s working on the character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23157">The Hurt character is obsessed with the injustice of life, and withdraws into a comfortable routine of inaction and noninvolvement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23158">This can work part of the time, but since we’re trying to take a passive character and make him active, we have to find a way of incorporating some kind of emotional reaction and making it more visually active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23159">Sometimes, in this situation, you can simply slide over the grief and get the character back on his feet by throwing him into a new situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23160">For example, one of my students was writing a script, a thriller, and the film opens up with a lovely anniversary dinner between a husband and wife. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23161">When the evening’s over, they decide to exchange cars for the drive home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23162">So the wife drives home in the husband’s car, but as she’s driving, the windows, doors, and sunroof suddenly seal shut, poison gas is released, and she’s killed.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23163">The man’s dramatic need is to pursue and find the killer(s) of his wife and bring them to justice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23164">But he never really accepts the mourning process, so he is constantly moving through the action devoid of any emotional reaction or grief. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23165">You could say that he’s in shock and total denial, and that may be so, but he becomes so obsessed with justice and revenge that he literally becomes a passive character in the midst of nonstop visual action.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23166">This is totally opposite the passive-active character portrayed by William Hurt in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23167">The Accidental Tourist</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23168">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23169">So it really doesn’t matter what kind of story you’re telling, whether an action, adventure, drama, or comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23170">That the Hurt character is a writer makes him even more difficult to portray visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23171">And it just didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23172">What happened in the film is exactly what happened in the screenplay: the main character Hurt portrays literally disappears off the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23173">Oh, yes, he’s there physically, but there’s no connection with the audience, and no sympathy for him whatsoever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23174">Which, of course, is part of his character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23175">The Geena Davis character, on the other hand, is striking in her “activity.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23176">She’s always in motion, and livens up the page, and the screen, by her presence, delightfully active in her quest to bring the Hurt character back into life again.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23177">But it isn’t enough.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23178">The passivity of the Hurt character drags the whole film down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23179">It was an attempt to make a passive character work on the screen, and it didn’t work; it was, as they say in Hollywood, an “interesting failure.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23180">On the other hand you have a character like Dr. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23181">Richard Kimble in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23182">The Fugitive</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23183"> (Andrew Davis), who is constantly reacting to a particular situation; in this case he’s wanted for the murder of his wife, and is on the run, trying to elude capture by the law in the form of the Tommy Lee Jones character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23184">His dramatic need, to prove his innocence and find out who actually committed the crime, is what drives him through the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23185">It’s the engine that keeps the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23186">So even though he’s continually reacting, he’s an active character because he causes things to happen, he’s always </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23187">doing something</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23188"> to try and prove his innocence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23189">And he’s not adverse to helping a little child who’s been misdiagnosed, by going back into the hospital and making a notation on the chart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23190">The little side journey reveals his character through his behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23191">Film, as I am so fond of saying, is behavior.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23192">Even if you have a character confined in a physical location does not mean that he or she has to be passive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23193">Hannibal Lecter in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23194">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23195"> (Ted Tally) is a good case in point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23196">Locked inside a prison cell, he is far from being passive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23197">Through insight and perception he prods, probes, and finally provokes Clarice Starling to confront and deal with her past, for two reasons: One, of course, is that he is tutoring her to bring the serial killer Buffalo Bill to justice, and by doing that he can achieve his </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23198">dramatic need</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23199">, which is to be moved to another prison facility where he can be placed in a cell with a window. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23200">His motivation, and the way he manipulates Clarice, even though he’s locked inside a small six-by-eight-foot cell, is honed to achieve his dramatic need; everything else is secondary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23201">So, he manipulates her to serve his own purpose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23202">That’s makes him an active character even though he’s locked in a passive location.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23203">When I was working with the Brazilian filmmaker on the screenplay about the famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos, he was very nervous giving me the screenplay to read, he confided, because it was such an unconventional story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23204">It was a nonlinear screenplay told in a series of flashbacks that traced five different threads of the composer’s life: his boyhood; his search for musical inspiration and direction; his relationships with the two significant women in his life; his life of celebrity and worldwide recognition; and lastly, his final concert and death.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23205">He thought the problems in the screenplay were structural; but what I discovered was that structure wasn’t really the problem; the main character, the composer, was the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23206">Because of the nature of the script, the composer was always reacting to the forces that were shaping his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23207">That made him a passive character, not an active one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23208">It made the screenplay a simple biography, not a visual experience of the man’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23209">That kind of story simply doesn’t work well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23210">No matter that the five different story threads were structured in a jigsaw-puzzle fashion; it didn’t change anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23211">Throughout the screenplay the main character was constantly reacting to other people, and this created a kind of visual landscape that forced him into the background, and made the secondary characters stronger and more dynamic.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23212">Once I identified the problem, we could approach it from the vantage point of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23213">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23214"> and not </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23215">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23216">, even though it touched both. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23217">So we went back to the foundation of the screenplay in order to make the composer more active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23218">The composer had </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23219">to create the action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23220"> that would cause other people to react. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23221">And this had to be set up from the very beginning, so we had to restructure the entire First Act, adding several new scenes in which the composer created the action, and the other characters reacted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23222">Even though this was an unconventional script, it was not difficult to find a way to solve this particular problem once we identified it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23223">Another way to make the character more active is to go back into your scenes and redefine the dramatic need, both in terms of overall story and in the context of each individual scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23224">If you determine the point of view of each character in each scene, then it’s possible to rewrite the scene adding conflict to achieve the maximum dramatic value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23225">Part of the reason a character seems to be passive and reactive is because there’s a lack of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23226">Nine times out of ten if you feel your character is too passive, or is reacting too much to an external situation or character, it’s due to a lack of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23227">So go back and redefine the internal and external forces working on the character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23228">If it’s an internal, emotional reaction to a situation or event, try to create a visual metaphor and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23229">let us see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23230"> it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23231">For example, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23232">Dances With Wolves</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23233"> after the John Dunbar character arrives at the fort at Plot Point I, the first thing he does is give himself the task of cleaning up the area; his behavior tells us that he’s cleaning up his life and putting things back in order.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23234">If you find it too difficult, then write a new character biography that will create a new </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23235">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23236">, and in this way you can establish a strong and perceptive point of view that will generate more conflict.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23237">That’s the essence of transforming a character from passive to active.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23283">What’s the best way to use a flashback? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23284">When does it work the best and when is it the most effective?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23285">These are some of the most common questions I encounter regarding the flashback; it really doesn’t matter what country I’m in, or whether the writers are students or professionals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23286">For some reason, the use of flashbacks in a screenplay seems to elicit indecision and insecurity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23287">So, when I’m asked what’s the best way to use a flashback, I listen patiently, then ask why the screenwriter wants to use one in the first place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23288">The person usually becomes very serious and states that the flashback gives information that’s essential to the story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23289">That’s cool, I respond, but if you use the flashback in this particular situation, does it move the story forward? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23290">Or, does it reveal something about the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23291">Remember, the flashback is simply a tool, a device, which the screenwriter uses to provide the reader with information that he or she cannot incorporate into the screenplay any other way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23292">That’s something most writers don’t understand or take into consideration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23293">That’s why there seems to be so much confusion about whether to use a flashback or not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23294">The purpose of the flashback is simple: it is a device that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23295">bridges time and place either to reveal information about the main character, or to move the story forward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23296">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23297">When flashbacks are done well and integrated into the narrative line of the story, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23298">How to Make an American Quilt, The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23299"> (Chris McQuarrie), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23300">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23301"> (Patrick Duncan), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23302">The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23303"> (Shane Black), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23304">Lone Star</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23305"> (John Sayles), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23306">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23307"> (Anthony Minghella), or are absorbed into the Third Act as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23308">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23309">, the flashback works wonderfully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23310">But when a flashback is thrown into the screenplay because the writer doesn’t know how to move the story forward any other way, or decides to show something about the main character that could be better stated in dialogue, then the flashback only draws attention to itself and becomes intrusive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23311">That’s when it doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23312">The flashback is a tool; it should be used to give the viewer information about the character or story that he can’t get any other way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23313">It can reveal </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23314">emotional</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23315"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23316">physical</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23317"> information (as with Andy Dufresne’s breakout from Shawshank), though it often does both, and can show different points of view of the same event, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23318">The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23319"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23320">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23321">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23322">Or it can reveal thoughts, memories, or dreams, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23323">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23324"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23325">Shine</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23326"> (Jan Sardi).</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23327">That’s when the flashback is most effective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23328">If it is incorrectly used, as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23329">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23330"> reveals, it only highlights flaws: characters who are too thin and weak, action too subtle or episodic, and the story itself seeming to wander around searching for itself, like a dog chasing its tail.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23331">I firmly believe that flashbacks are an aspect of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23332">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23333">, not story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23334">As a matter of fact, I tell my students that a flashback is really a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23335">“flashpresent,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23336"> because what we’re really seeing is what the character is thinking and feeling in present time, whether a memory, an event, or fantasy, or the illumination of the character’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23337">What we see in a flashback is shown through the eyes of the character, so we’re seeing what he or she is seeing, thinking, or feeling in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23338">present time;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23339"> in this time and in this place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23340">No matter what it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23341">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23342">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23343"> again, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23344">Shine</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23345">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23346">Lone Star;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23347"> the action all takes place in present time with the character remembering moments in time past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23348">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23349">“flashpresent”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23350"> is anything the character is thinking and feeling in the present moment, whether a thought, a dream, a memory, or a hope, a fear, or fantasy, for time has no restraints or limits. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23351">In the character’s head the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23352">“flashpresent”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23353"> could be past, present, or future.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23354">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23355">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23356">, for example, the same incident is seen through the eyes of different characters, and each one views it differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23357">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23358">subject</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23359"> of the script is honor; it dramatizes how a person must learn to live with a mistake he made that resulted in the death of a friend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23360">Not only that, but the Denzel Washington character is forced to lie to the dead man’s family at the urging of the military. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23361">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23362">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23363"> of the film, what holds it together, the circumstances or situation, is the Gulf War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23364">Each particular flashback reveals what happened when a medic helicopter on a rescue mission was shot down by Iraqi soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23365">What happened when the helicopter went down? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23366">That’s the assignment of the officer in charge, Colonel Serling, played by Denzel Washington. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23367">The pilot who flew the mission is being considered for the Medal of Honor, America’s highest and most prestigious military award. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23368">But it turns out there are some discrepancies in the survivors’ stories, and to add further fuel to the fire, the captain of the medic helicopter is a woman, played by Meg Ryan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23369">Colonel Serling is told by the White House that it is important politically for her to receive the medal, for it will be the first time a woman would have been so honored for courage under fire.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23370">The script begins with an incident in the Gulf War that takes place at night, in the heat of battle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23371">Colonel Serling makes a decision to fire at a tank that does not respond to his message. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23372">Only after the tank is destroyed, and all men lost, does he learn the tank was one of his own, captained by his friend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23373">That’s the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23374">inciting incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23375"> of the screenplay, the incident or event that catapults the story into motion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23376">When he returns to the States, he’s given the assignment of investigating the woman’s actions, and is forced to look into the mirror of his own soul to examine his own actions under fire, which he cannot forgive or forget.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23377">So we explore the subject of “courage under fire.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23378">As he’s investigating the actions of the Meg Ryan character, he forces himself to seek out the truth, while under constant pressure from the White House and the military. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23379">He finds that for each step he takes, his actions are reflected back at him through his own experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23380">But it’s the perfect setup for using the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23381">This is the kind of story I call an “emotional detective story,” for each member of the surviving crew sees the action differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23382">It’s a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23383">Rashomon-type</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23384"> story, and it’s up to the Denzel Washington character to sort things out and find “the truth.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23385">His search becomes a journey of transformation and self-forgiveness.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23386">It’s true there are two different stories in this screenplay, but both stories reflect the emotional scar that remains unhealed in Colonel Serling’s heart, and his dramatic need is to resolve the conflict within himself.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23387">Two other examples that use the flashback effectively are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23388">The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23389"> (Shane Black) and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23390">The Usual Suspects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23391">The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23392"> is the story of an amnesia victim (Geena Davis) who has a memory of only “three thousand days,” eight years by her count. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23393">Her name is Samantha, Sam for short, and she has no memory of her past life other than being washed up on the beach in a T-shirt and jeans. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23394">Since that time she has married a nice man, Hal, and has a wonderful eight-year-old daughter, and continuously wonders about her past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23395">As she says in her voice-over in the opening scenes, when she woke up, her daughter was “two months grown in my belly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23396">I don’t know who put her there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23397">I may never. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23398">I just know she’s mine, and she’s about to turn eight.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23399">When the script opens, it is near Christmas Eve and as she’s driving her father-in-law home, she inadvertently hits a deer that kills her father-in-law, and she lands in the hospital. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23400">But something’s wrong, something she can’t explain, and she feels the need for a cigarette, even though she doesn’t smoke. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23401">As she lights up, she sees herself in the hospital mirror and suddenly her reflection becomes alive, drenched in blood, and the reflection says her real name is Charly and she smokes Marlboro Reds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23402">This starts a series of quick-cut flashbacks where she learns more about her identity.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23403">Things start heating up on Christmas Eve when a group of carolers are singing carols in front of the house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23404">Only something’s wrong; the carolers are singing horribly off key. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23405">And when Sam throws open the door to welcome them and offer some Christmas cheer to them, no one is there except a trained killer pointing a shotgun at her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23406">And he calls her Charly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23407">And she reacts, yanking the gun out of his hand, leading to a wild and woolly fight sequence where we learn (as she learns) that she definitely has the ability to take care of herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23408">She ends up killing him, brutally, shocking herself as much as her family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23409">Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23410">She’s really incredible at what she does and she’s astonished that somewhere within her memory banks is this amazing killing machine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23411">It frightens her and she begins her journey of self-discovery to recover her lost life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23412">It’s easy to see how the script is an ideal vehicle for the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23413">Every time Sam finds herself in a certain situation, the screenwriter draws upon a wonderful tool to show us some of the incidents and events of her past life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23414">And it’s not until the Mid-Point that she fully steps into her identity as Charly, and learns (at the same time we learn) that she was an assassin for the CIA. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23415">And they want her dead because she “knows too much.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23416">She is truly a lethal weapon—so lethal, in fact, that she wonders, as we do, how she could have lived so contentedly as a wife and mother with this killing machine inside her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23417">And this is what she’s trying to resolve.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23418">We’re not talking about the quality of writing here, or how good or bad the film is, we’re simply talking about creating the cinematic </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23419">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23420"> of taking a particular situation and effectively incorporating flashbacks into the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23421">All the flashbacks used are points of present time, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23422">“flashpresent.”</span></i></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23423">Which is illustrated very clearly in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23424">The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23425">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23426">What makes the screenplay so unique is that we’re examining one particular event, an explosion on board a ship in the San Pedro harbor that kills some twenty-seven men over a reported $91 million in cocaine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23427">This event is seen through a series of voice-over flashbacks narrated by “Verbal” Kint (Kevin Spacey), a palsied con artist with a twisted foot and a penchant for talking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23428">Verbal is one of two survivors of the blast (the other is an aged Hungarian gangster), and under the relentless questioning of the customs agent played by Chazz Palminteri, Verbal tells the story of “what happened.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23429">The context of the script is tailored to become the perfect vehicle to show the events leading up to the shipboard blast, the inciting incident that opens the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23430">There is no linear story-line progression here, meaning we don’t go through the story from beginning to end, chronologically, but the flashbacks reveal what happened in visual bits and pieces.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23431">As Verbal is being questioned, he tells us, in voice-over, how the five suspects were picked up, placed in the same holding cell, and questioned about the hijacking of a truckload of gun parts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23432">And as Verbal answers the policeman’s questions, we start fitting the individual pieces of the visual jigsaw puzzle together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23433">These questions work as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23434">lead-ins</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23435"> to the individual flashback sequences and, again, should be thought of as a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23436">“flashpresent”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23437"> because Verbal is literally making the story up as he goes along. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23438">It’s a bold cinematic demonstration of taking a singular incident, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23439">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23440">, and presenting it in a nonlinear fashion.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23441">Which brings us back to the question of when to use a flashback, and when not to, and how to solve a problem with it, either by incorporating it into the story line or by removing it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23442">There are no “rules,” of course, about this; it really depends upon whether you’ve designed the flashback to be an integral part of the story, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23443">Courage Under Fire, The Usual Suspects, The Long Kiss Goodnight, How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23444">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23445">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23446">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23451">Now, I’m sure this sounds like a contradiction, because the object of a screenplay is to tell the story in pictures, not words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23452">The dialogue only becomes an adjunct to the visual information that moves the story forward; either that, or it reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23453">Suppose, for example, you want to show an event that has affected your character, and you decide to incorporate it into the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23454">So you go through the scene and find a place to lead into the flashback, which naturally results in your cutting away from the middle of the scene to insert the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23455">What happens? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23456">In the case of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23457">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23458"> it works wonderfully, because the patient is a mystery, and slowly we begin to learn who he is, and his affair with Katherine, but each time we cut away there is a natural and solid transition point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23459">Plus, the entire love affair, though told in flashback, is really the structural foundation of the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23460">We learn what happened to the English patient at the same time Hana (Juliet Binoche) does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23461">It works wonderfully.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23462">By the same token there’s also a good chance that you might destroy the integrity of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23463">And that, of course, is not the point of the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23464">If you cut away in the middle of a scene, it could also create another problem instead. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23465">Why?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23466">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23467">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23468">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23469">When Clarice Starling visits Hannibal Lecter in his makeshift prison cell after he’s been transferred to Memphis, she wants to obtain the name of the serial killer Buffalo Bill. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23470">And she knows that Lecter knows the identity of the killer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23471">She wants that name, but they don’t have much time before she’ll be forced to leave. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23472">His reply is that “we don’t measure time in the same way, do we, Clarice?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23473">and then he insists that she tell him more about her childhood after the death of her father. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23474">Knowing the guards will return any moment (which creates a tremendous tension in the scene), she proceeds to tell him that she was sent to live with her uncle in Montana. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23475">One night, she tells Lecter, she woke up hearing “screams,” and when she sneaks out of bed to investigate, she finds men slaughtering the spring lambs in the barn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23476">Horrified, she tries to save one of the lambs, but can only carry it about a mile before she’s caught and returned to the ranch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23477">Her uncle is furious, and, in retaliation he sends her away to an orphanage, and that’s where she spends the rest of her childhood growing up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23478">It’s a powerful scene, and especially significant since the title of the book and screenplay was taken from it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23479">The scene was originally conceived as a flashback with the dialogue in present time playing over the images of Clarice as a little girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23480">But when Jonathan Demme filmed it, he saw the emotional dynamic of the scene between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster was so intense that if he cut away to show the child discovering the slaughtering of the spring lambs, he would absolutely destroy the integrity of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23481">As mentioned, this is one of the most important scenes in the film because it is the final flashback that shows her confronting the events of her past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23482">Without completing this incident in her childhood, Clarice would have been incomplete in her growth, both as a person and FBI agent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23483">Which is a major part of her character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23484">On film the scene was so strong that the director couldn’t cut away and incorporate the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23485">The price would have been too high had he chosen to use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23486">He would have lost the emotional integrity of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23487">So he decided to keep the action in present time to maintain that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23488">And, if you remember, the entire scene is played in close shot and it’s so powerful that it remains firmly fixed in the memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23489">The information revealed about the character was more revealing and more dramatic stated in dialogue than it would have been in flashback.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23490">This is not a hard-and-fast “rule,” but it is something to remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23491">So </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23492">if you can say it, don’t show it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23493">.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23526">The flashback that opens the Third Act is beautifully structured, and incorporates the flashback at this point as an integral part of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23527">It’s what every flashback should do and be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23528">“Get busy living or get busy dying,” Andy tells Red in the scene after Tommy is killed by the warden. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23529">The sequence opens with Andy waiting in his cell as the lights go out, and Red, in voice-over, tells us that “I’ve had some long nights in stir. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23530">Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23531">No one knows what Andy’s going to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23532">We watch as Andy gathers his belongings, pulls on the rope, and then we cut away to Red, waiting, wondering.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23533">The next morning Andy is missing from cell count. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23534">No one knows where or how he disappeared, and it drives the warden crazy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23535">As the warden questions Red and the guards, he throws one of the rocks Andy left behind at the large poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23536">But a strange thing happens; the rock goes right through the paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23537">Everybody stops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23538">The warden moves toward the poster, pokes his finger through the hole, then shoves his entire arm through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23539">He yanks the poster off the wall and we discover (as the characters discover) that a tunnel has been hollowed out of the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23540">We cut to a montage of several police cars racing down the highway, and guards combing the countryside, and all they find is part of Andy’s torn shirt and his loyal rock hammer, which has been worn down to the nub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23541">That’s the flashpoint by which we lead into the flashback and Red tells us, in voice-over, how Andy got out of Shawshank Prison.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23542">We see a couple of scenes of Andy picking at the wall with his rock hammer to carve his name when a chunk of rock falls out; then we see him in the movie requesting the Rita Hayworth poster; then shots of Andy digging into the tunnel at night, and emptying the gravel from the tunnel into the prison yard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23543">Then we flashback again and see Andy’s last night as he polishes the warden’s shoes, only this time we see it from Andy’s point of view; we see him substituting the false ledger for the warden’s, and he puts the false one into the safe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23544">Then we see him walking back into the cell block, only this time we see the shoes he is wearing; bright and shiny. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23545">In Andy’s cell we see him taking off his prison garb, revealing the warden’s shirt and tie underneath, then he places his goods into the plastic bag and starts his escape to freedom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23546">Red tells us in voice-over that “Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I can’t even imagine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23547">Or maybe I just don’t want to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23548">Five hundred yards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23549">The length of five football fields. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23550">Just shy of half a mile.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23551">This is just a wonderful flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23552">Structured in a nonlinear way, it moves the story forward and reveals a part of his character that we never knew existed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23553">Not once during the entire Second Act did he ever mention that he was considering escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23554">But if you think about it, that is his character’s dramatic need; to get out of prison must be the dramatic need of every convict doing time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23555">We don’t need to state it, but the screenwriter must know it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23556">Andy’s escape is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23557">physical</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23558"> use of the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23559">It shows us how he escaped. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23560">But there’s also an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23561">emotional</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23562"> use of the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23563">In How </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23564">to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23565"> there are six different stories that deal with various aspects of love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23566">The subject of the quilt, “Where Love Resides” is what the story is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23567">The screenplay itself is structured very much like a quilt; piece by piece, story by story, certain situations in life and love are shown that allow Finn to ferret out what she needs to learn so as to let go of her fear of commitment.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23568">What works so well is the lead-in point where the flashback dovetails into present time, and it’s this weaving of narrative story line between past and present that illuminates Finn’s dilemma so well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23569">Each piece of the quilt the women are making gives us some insight and understanding into the nature of love.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23570">Using flashbacks in this manner offers a unique perspective on the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23571">Before she can deal with the commitment of marriage, Finn must learn to confront her own emotional fear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23572">This is shown in two ways: one, through the dissertation she’s now working on (her third, she explains); we see her past history is constant as we learn, that when her thesis is almost complete, she decides that’s not the subject she really wants, and so begins another thesis on another subject. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23573">I think we’re all like Finn in a way, because most of us have struggled with the fears and insecurities of an emotional commitment at some point in our lives.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23574">The first thing we learn about Finn is that her fear of commitment has been passed down to her from her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23575">“Maybe she was just afraid that their relationship had become just like everyone else’s,” she confides, and that’s why her parents separated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23576">So, when Sam proposes to Finn, she, caught in this emotional turmoil, runs away to the safety of her grandmother’s house.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23577">As mentioned, each of the quilters’ particular stories reflects a certain emotional aspect in relationship to love and commitment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23578">There is something Finn must learn from all the stories so she can resolve the conflict of “where love resides” within herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23579">This is a very good example of the way flashback reveals the emotional conflict that resides at the core of Finn’s character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23580">Which brings us back to the basic question of this chapter: When can you use a flashback to solve a particular problem?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23581">The examples given illustrate the basic context of the flashback; either physical or emotional, it is the point at which you slide into the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23582">“flashpresent.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23583"> If you feel you have a problem the flashback creates or can solve, what do you perceive the problem to be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23584">First, ask yourself what you want to use the flashback for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23585">Is it to reveal character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23586">Or is it to show </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23587">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23588"> an event reveals the character, in terms of their actions and reactions? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23589">What incident are you going to show, and what does it reveal about the character, and how is it going to move the story forward?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23590">If, for example, you have a situation where you think your story is wandering around in circles, or your character is too talky and explains too many things, you might consider using a flashback to reveal a certain aspect of your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23591">If your character is too passive and reactive, or feels too thin or one-dimensional, you could use a flashback to provide more depth and dimension to your story line.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23629">Some films incorporate the flashback as a major part of the story; they use it to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23630">“bookend”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23631"> their main story line, meaning they open the script with an incident or event, and then flashback to the actual story, then end it in present time again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23632">A few films that do this well are: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23633">The Bridges of Madison County, Sunset Boulevard, Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23634">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23635">Citizen Kane</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23636">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23637">And, of course, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23638">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23639">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23640">Should you decide to use a flashback, make sure it doesn’t intrude upon the flow of the action, or get in the way of the story, or draw too much attention to itself.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23684">Structure is the foundation of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23685">The word itself means “to build, or put together,” so when you start structuring your script, you’re building and putting scenes, sequences, and acts together into a unified whole with a definite beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23686">Structure can be either linear or nonlinear, depending on the needs of your story.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23687">The second definition of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23688">structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23689">, as it relates to screenwriting, is “the relationship between the parts and the whole.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23690">Since you have to build, or put together, various parts of the screenplay, whether a scene, or the individual shots that comprise the scene, or the separate scenes that make up a sequence, or the necessary character elements you need to integrate into the narrative line, the insertion of a flashback or flashforward structure becomes the glue that holds everything together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23691">It’s like gravity, the force that sustains the entire physical universe.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23692">When you read and analyze a good screenplay it’s like seeing bits and pieces of film joined together to create a series of moving images, the story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23693">A clock ticking, a car moving slowly down a crowded city street, a woman peering out a window, the sound of a baby crying or a dog barking, the car pulling into a parking space, all these bits and pieces of little pictures can be joined together to create a tense and suspense-filled sequence that has the reader, or audience, on the edge of their collective seats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23694">That’s what film is all about, building, or putting together, these little bits and pieces of images that are joined together to create an organic story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23695">Remember the definition of a screenplay: “a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23696">When we approach the dynamics of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23697">Problem Solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23698"> in screenwriting, all the solutions, to whatever the problem, will utilize </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23699">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23700">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23701">That’s because when you fix, or correct, a particular problem, you have to reconstruct, or rebuild, the elements, or content, that make up the narrative line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23702">A story is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23703">whole</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23704"> made up of specific </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23705">parts:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23706"> the action, the characters, the locations, sets, scenes, sequences, Acts, Plot Points, music, effects, and so on, all these </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23707">parts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23708"> go into the craft of building and putting together a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23709">It’s the understanding of this relationship between the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23710">parts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23711"> that make up the story, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23712">whole</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23713">, which allows you to approach Problem Solving from the confidence and security that you know what you’re doing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23714">Yes, structure </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23715">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23716"> the foundation of screenwriting, and it’s also an essential part of the problem-solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23717">If you have a scene that doesn’t play well, for whatever reason, and you define it as a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23718">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23719">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23720">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23721">, you’re going to have to go back and create new incidents, episodes, or events to blend into the material, and that’s going to create a new mix. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23722">Anything you add is going to have to be restructured and rebuilt; as Newton’s Third Law of Motion states, “For every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23723">For every cause there is an effect, and if you’ve not fleshed out a particular scene to the necessary degree, you’re going to have to go back into that material and change a few things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23724">And whatever you change, you’re going to have to restructure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23725">It’s as simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23726">So what kind of problems are you dealing with within the context of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23727">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23728">?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23729">First, you have the context of story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23730">Is your story focused, clear, and precise, or does it seem to wander around trying to find its line of action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23731">Even the most complicated script, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23732">The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23733">, is clear and concise, at least from the writer’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23734">Does your story seem to skirt on the edge of things and not go deeply enough in terms of action and character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23735">Does it appear that your scenes have no dramatic payoff? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23736">Do your characters seem to be wandering around searching for their dramatic need?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23737">All these are symptoms of something that’s not quite right with your structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23738">It could be the scenes are too short, or not paid off, or the story line seems to wander around with no sense of development, which, remember, is defined as “a line of direction.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23739">In short, with a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23740">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23741">, something seems to be missing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23742">I believe that good structure in a screenplay should not be seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23743">Good structure should simply disappear into the content of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23744">When I first started developing my concepts of structure, I would go to a movie, watch and notebook in hand, and dutifully time the individual Plot Points, because I wanted to clarify and define screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23745">Form, not formula. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23746">Looking back on it now, I see I was trying to locate and define the building blocks of the screenplay, and what I discovered was that structure was like the DNA of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23747">When I read a screenplay now, or see a film, I really don’t pay too much attention to structure; I just let the material wash over me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23748">If the script or film doesn’t feel right, if there seems to be some kind of problem, then I’ll go into the material and analyze it structurally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23749">I can recognize structure by the particular beats in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23750">I’ve always maintained that the screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader turning pages, so if I find myself becoming bogged down in the reading experience, that’s a signal there may be something wrong structurally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23751">If I can’t follow the story line, if it wanders around, or something seems to be missing, or if too much is happening, or there are too many characters, or nothing seems to be paid off, that’s a symptom that something’s wrong; that’s when I’ll start breaking it down into its component parts.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23752">Good structure alone does not make a good screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23753">That’s simply a fact of life that everyone has to remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23754">So many times people will tell me they’ve written a screenplay “just the way you say it should be done,” and immediately I get suspicious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23755">By the same token the opposite is also true: you can’t have a good screenplay without good structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23756">Structure is only the foundation, the start point, not the be-all and end-all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23757">Characters, action, dynamic visuals, and strong situations are only some of the things that make up a good screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23758">So many times people ask me for examples of movies that don’t have a good structure and I really can’t give too many examples. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23759">That’s because a film without good structure doesn’t hold up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23760">It wanders, is slow to develop, and the only thing that can save it is the dimension of its characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23761">The audience perceives this, so the film only has a run of a few weeks and then disappears deep into the bowels of the film graveyard.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23762">The definition of structure, remember, is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23763">to build</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23764">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23765">to put something together</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23766">, and as so often happens, when you correct one problem in a screenplay it always affects something else, so you have to add elements, or remove elements, to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23767">That means building, or putting together, a new scene or sequence.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23768">So what we’ll try to do in this section is uncover various problems that exist as a result of structure, and which can be solved by restructuring the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23769">And, at the risk of repeating myself again, no matter what the problem, you’re going to have to restructure the material, whether it’s a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23770">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23771">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23772">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23773">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23774">In the arena of Problem Solving, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23775">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23776"> is an integral part of every solution.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23777">One of the problems I’ve become aware of in my teaching experience is that writers will sometimes write key scenes, either action or dialogue, which are not paid off; the scenes usually end too early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23778">In a dramatic scene, for example, the screenwriter will cut to the next scene before the purpose of that particular scene is realized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23779">And then, when I’m reading the material, I get the feeling something’s missing; the action feels incomplete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23780">It’s so important—essential—to determine the purpose of the scene in order to dramatically realize the intention of that scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23781">A few years ago I was commissioned to read and analyze a screenplay for a producer/writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23782">It was an action-thriller set in the Cayman Islands, a marvelous location for this kind of film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23783">The story, about a photographer who accidentally stumbles into a situation where he becomes a target for murder, was interesting and well written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23784">There were good action sequences and the script was well structured.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23785">But as I was reading the screenplay, I kept getting lost in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23786">I was confused and so many characters were pulled into the narrative line, I didn’t know who the main character was and what the whole thing was about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23787">Even though the premise was good, with solid visuals and locations, good action sequences, and interesting characters, somehow I got the feeling that something was missing, something just wasn’t right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23788">I couldn’t pinpoint the problem, so I started examining it more closely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23789">As I read through the screenplay again, I saw that many of the key scenes were not complete, that the action had stopped before the dramatic requirements of the scenes had been satisfied. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23790">In the middle of a confrontation scene, for example, the writer would cut away to another scene, or to another character, and this altered the focus of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23791">I had the impression that something was definitely missing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23792">With that in mind, I went back and looked at the material again, and saw that this particular trait had become a tendency on the part of the writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23793">In scene after scene, a scene or situation would be set up, and then before the purpose of the scene was realized, he left the scene; the scene was not really paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23794">So while the idea of the scene had been planted, it had never come to fruition, and therefore the action and story line seemed hazy and uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23795">Now, I had been aware of this phenomenon before, but I never had a name for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23796">But this was such a clear example of the problem that I labeled it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23797">Sceneus Interruptus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23798">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23799">Leaving the scene too early simply means the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23800">purpose of the scene is unsatisfied, unfulfilled</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23801">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23802">It does not accomplish its dramatic function and therefore leaves a gaping hole in the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23803">And when that happens, something is definitely missing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23804">This particular problem could be approached from either </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23805">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23806"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23807">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23808">, of course, but I chose to put it under the heading of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23809">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23810"> because if you leave the scene too early, you’ve got to add components back into the material in order to reconstruct the unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23811">That’s how you build tension and pacing, by going into the elements of the material and finding ways of expanding it visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23812">That’s why when you see a shot of a key being placed in a lock, or thread being stitched into a piece of fabric, or a bullet placed into the chamber of a gun, it expands the visual tension of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23813">That’s why film is such an art form where time can be stretched or condensed and becomes larger than life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23814">Pacing is always related to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23815">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23816">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23817">If there aren’t enough elements in the scene to hold it together, the chances are it will bog down and not go anywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23818">The tension will be dissipated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23819">Conversely, if you have too many elements in the scene, the pacing will also be off, and the material will have a slow, wandering feel to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23820">Again, no tension.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23871">Now, at first glance it may appear that nothing is really “wrong” here, that whatever problem there is might be fixed by simply adding some dialogue or opening up the scenes visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23872">But if you take the context of the story line into account, you’ll see there’s really no narrative thread. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23873">The writer cuts away from the scene before the purpose of the scene is established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23874">And that’s what made me so uncomfortable reading it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23875">This little scene where Gary confronts Helo is way too thin, and really doesn’t say anything that will move the story forward or reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23876">Granted, the whole section is taken out of context, but it’s pretty clear that more has to be added, not only from the story line’s point of view, but also from the character’s perspective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23877">Helo is Gary’s first link to the crime, so we must see these two men warily circling each other before they confront each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23878">As you can see, the writer cuts away from every scene before anything significant happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23879">Because the purpose of the scene has not been satisfied (establishing a link between Helo and the crime), cutting away too soon simply dissipates the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23880">Whatever tension there might have been has simply vanished.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23885">That’s what happens here in this short section. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23886">The action seems disjointed and listless, the natural transitions are forced and contrived, and the action moves along like a car with a flat tire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23887">For the reader, concentration is lost, the interest in the story line wanes, and the script is usually shelved before it’s been completely read.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23888">I think the most difficult thing about this problem is simply recognizing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23889">So many times we read and reread the material looking for ways to improve it, and we have a hard time seeing that a scene ends too early.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23890">Once you become aware that the problem exists, you can fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23891">And the way to do that is to break every scene down and restructure it into a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23892">First, what’s the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23893">What’s it doing there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23894">What does the character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23895">In what way does this scene relate to the character’s dramatic need in the screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23896">Where has the character come from, and where is he/she going after the scene is finished? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23897">These questions must be addressed and resolved before the scene begins.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23898">If you don’t know what’s going on during the scene, who does? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23899">That means knowing what the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of your character are, and keeping them clearly in mind as the scene plays out.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23900">How do you know when you’ve satisfied the requirements of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23901">There’s no real way of knowing that, of course, except that each scene becomes a link in the chain of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23902">Each scene, as mentioned, is like a living cell; it should contain everything within it, either to move the story forward or to reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23903">Just like the DNA molecule in living cells. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23904">Every scene serves a particular function, and it’s up to you, the screenwriter, to know or determine what that function is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23905">What is its purpose? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23906">If you don’t know what it is, or what it does, or why it’s there, you’ll probably have to drop it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23907">Just cut it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23908">The chances are it doesn’t belong in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23909">You have to be ruthless when you’re writing a screenplay, especially when you’re trying to solve a problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23910">Screenwriters all over the world have the same complaint; they always have to cut what they think are their best scenes, their best writing, out of the scripts.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23911">To solve the problems of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23912">Sceneus Interruptus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23913">, start by rethinking the parameters of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23914">What are the character’s thoughts, feelings, or emotions when the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23915">Where is he or she coming from, and what is the emotional reality working on the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23916">Does your character have a sore throat and does he seem to be cold? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23917">Has he/she just managed to escape from a would-be attacker? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23918">Is he/she preparing for a big showdown, or confrontation scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23919">So, define the emotional forces working on your character when the scene begins.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23920">The next step is to find out what elements you have to work with within the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23921">Where does it take place? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23922">What time of the day or night? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23923">Is there anything within the setting of the scene that you can use to your advantage, dramatically? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23924">The weather, a crowded art gallery, a crowded restaurant, a market, or on the street? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23925">Or is it late at night, where the silence and emptiness of the location seem to create their own ambience? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23926">Once you establish the environmental elements, you can break the scene down into beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23927">On a separate piece of paper, break down the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23928">To start, where does your character come from before the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23929">Write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23930">If the scene takes place in a library, for example, your character may have come from the office, or maybe an exercise class; if the latter, then it means that he will have to dress, leave the area, walk to the subway or car, ride or drive to the destination, park, get out, walk up the steps, and enter the lobby. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23931">That’s the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23932">And remember conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23933">Maybe something happens on the way to the scene that affects the character, so you might want to create a little back story to the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23934">Then, find a way to dramatize the purpose of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23935">Why is the character at the library? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23936">To find a certain book, do some research on the Internet, or have a clandestine meeting?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23937">Isolate the flow of events that make up the middle of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23938">The character arrives, walks into the lobby, searches for someone or something, then finds the person or book he or she is looking for, finds a corner table to sit down at, and then the purpose of the scene begins to unfold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23939">What’s the nature of the dialogue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23940">Is it direct, for exposition, so the story can move forward? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23941">Or is there a subtext to the dialogue, a hidden meaning, or an indirect threat? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23942">Is this a scene that reveals something about the character, that gives us some insight into the emotional or physical landscape of the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23943">It doesn’t have to be much. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23944">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23945">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23946"> we can tell what Colonel Serling is thinking or feeling when he pulls out a bottle of Scotch and takes a long pull. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23947">We don’t need any more explanation than that.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23948">Then, the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23949">The character(s) get up, leave the library, and then where do they go or what do they do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23950">Do you follow the main character, or the other person? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23951">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23952">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23953"> the interesting thing about the bar scene in the beginning where Vinnie (Travolta) meets Butch (Willis) is that we could have followed the Butch character just as easily we do Vinnie on his “date” with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23954">This is all creative choice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23955">Does anything happen on the way to the next scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23956">How much time elapses between the scene in the library and the next scene?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23957">Look it over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23958">Have you satisfied the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23959">That is, does it contain the correct information, either visually, or emotionally, or physically, or through the dialogue, to be complete within itself, or to act as a link to another scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23960">As we’ll see in </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-86"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23961">Chapter 19</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23962">, it’s always better to enter the scene late and get out early, but the only way you can really do that is if you are totally clear on what each beat or movement is, within the body of the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23963">Is there enough conflict within the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23964">Are the characters’ points of view clear, concentrated, and focused? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23965">That’s something you have to be clear about yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23966">That’s your homework, and nobody can do it but you.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23967">If you’re not clear about the relationship between the main character and the person he or she is meeting in the library, then write a short, free-association essay of two or three pages about their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23968">When did they first meet, and where? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23969">What happened? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23970">What you’re really trying to do is to get enough information so you can make sure your scene works and is totally effective for the purpose it serves in the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23971">When you complete the necessary preparation, then do your breakdown of beginning, middle, and end, and then select bits and pieces from each category to set up and then pay off the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23972">For example, we could start with a shot of the office clock, followed by a shot of the character looking and thinking, then cut to him or her riding in the subway, or driving, then entering the lobby of the library, searching for the other character, their meeting, and then pay it off with a shot of the character leaving, and walking down the steps, or simply go into a transition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23973">Clean, lean, and tight.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23974">In this way you know that the purpose of the scene is satisfied, complete unto itself, providing as well a necessary link in the chain of dramatic action, so the story can move forward with concise skill and visual continuity.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24026">In the first few pages of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24027">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24028">, Thelma is “packing,” literally throwing stuff into a suitcase for their weekend excursion to the mountains, and the last thing she does is open the nightstand drawer next to the bed, and “we see a gun, one Darryl bought her for protection. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24029">It is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24030">She picks up the gun like it’s a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse…”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24031">This little scene, more like a mention, doesn’t seem like much at the time, just part of her ditzy character, like eating a frozen candy bar for breakfast one bite at a time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24032">Later, when Thelma and Louise are driving toward their anticipated weekend, Thelma hands the gun to Louise, saying, “You take care of this.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24033">Louise is shocked: “What in the hell did you bring that for?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24034">“Oh, you know…” Thelma replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24035">“In case there’s any crazy psycho killers on the loose,” and they both laugh at her outrageous behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24036">Louise tells her to “put it in my purse.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24037">In reality, this little bit seems like a “throwaway,” something to shed light on the character, nothing that’s really too important. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24038">It’s only later, when Harlan is in the parking lot, forcing himself on Thelma, that the gun comes into play. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24039">Louise takes it out of her purse, orders him to stop, which he does reluctantly, and when he exchanges words with her, she loses it and blows him away.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24040">This gun is integral to the plot of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24041">If Thelma had not taken the gun with her, had not given it to Louise, Harlan would not have been killed, they would not become fugitives from the law, and the whole story wouldn’t have happened; in short, if there were no gun there wouldn’t have been any </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24042">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24043">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24044">Setting up some of the various story elements of the screenplays is essential to the art of Problem Solving. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24045">Whether a particular element, an object or an event, deals with setting up the story, setting up a character, or character trait, understanding when and when not to establish a story point is the difference between a script that works and one that does not.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24046">The setting up of these story elements often becomes the “glue” that holds everything together, which is why it’s a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24047">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24048">, not </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24049">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24050"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24051">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24052">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24053">If it ain’t on the page, it ain’t on the stage is the old Hollywood expression, and knowing when to set something up and then pay it off is fundamental to the craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24054">Different things must be set up, then incorporated into the story line—that’s one of the principal rules of all writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24055">One of the most important elements is setting up the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24056">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24057"> of the screenplay; that is, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24058">what the story is about</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24059">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24060">The Set-Up also refers to setting up the first ten pages of the screenplay, establishing the inciting incident, as well as providing enough exposition to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24061">Setting up these elements gives texture and direction, the natural line of development, to the narrative.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24062">Characters also have to be set up, along with their characteristics and manners of behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24063">Character aspects serve a variety of dramatic functions, like Louise knowing how to handle a gun. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24064">What happened to her in Texas when she was growing up, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24065">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24066">, is a character element that is essential to know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24067">As mentioned earlier, it was Louise, the young girl raped in Texas, who really pulled the trigger, not the Louise of the present.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24068">If certain elements of character are set up, then they have to be paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24069">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24070">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24071">, Andy Dufresne had been a respectable banker in a Portland, Maine, bank, before being convicted of his wife’s murder, so he knows enough about the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24072">system</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24073"> to create a fictitious identity, to establish a phony driver’s license, birth certificate, and passport as well as duplicate a set of account books. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24074">So we believe he could take the warden’s money—which he has laundered and deposited in banks all over the Portland, Maine, area—to Mexico. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24075">“On the outside,” he says to Red, “I was an honest man. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24076">I had to come to prison to learn how to be a crook.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24077">And that information, which had been set up early in the screenplay, was not finally paid off until the end of the Second Act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24078">So it really doesn’t matter where the story point is paid off, as long as it’s set up properly, whether it’s related to the character or the plot.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24079">There are other elements that need to be set up in a screenplay, specific objects, for example, like the gun in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24080">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24081">, or the rock hammer in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24082">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24083">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24084">These particular objects are essential to the story line, so they need to be planted in the screenplay at different points within the landscape of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24085">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24086">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24087"> we have seen the warden giving Andy clothes to take to the prison laundry, and shoes to shine, so when he gives Andy his clothes and shoes on the night he makes his escape, it’s totally believable, meaning it’s paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24088">The “willing suspension of disbelief” has been set up and we buy it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24089">It’s good writing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24090">So understanding how to set up characters, situations, and objects in a screenplay and then paying them off is necessary to the Problem-Solving process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24091">This was something I had to learn in my own screenwriting experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24092">When I first started writing screenplays, I didn’t know anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24093">I didn’t know what a screenplay was, I didn’t know what it meant to tell a story with pictures, I had no idea about structure or building a story, and didn’t know anything about setting up a story or situation, or paying it off, for that matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24094">Though I had been an English major at UC Berkeley, as well as a published film and book reviewer, I still didn’t have the foggiest notion about the nature and craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24095">When I began experimenting with the screenplay form, I understood I had to learn it, literally, from the ground up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24096">Which meant I had to teach myself how to write a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24097">There were no books or anything about it, and the only thing I had at my disposal was Lajos Egri’s great book </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24098">The Art of Dramatic Writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24099">, written in the forties about the craft of playwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24100">So I did the only thing I could do: I got hold of some screenplays from the two filmmakers I admired the most and started reading and rereading the material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24101">These were really my mentors in the art and craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24102">I have mentioned Jean Renoir’s contribution to my understanding of film education in both </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24103">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24104"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24105">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24106">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24107">But I consider two writer-directors to have been my teachers, and both were masters of the cinema. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24108">One of them was the great Sam Peckinpah (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24109">The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24110">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24111">The Ballad of Cable</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24112">Hogue</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24113">, to name just a few). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24114">I was so impressed with Peckinpah’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24115">Ride the High Country</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24116"> that I wrote a piece for the magazine </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24117">Film Quarterly</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24118"> on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24119">A few years later I had the great good fortune of being with Sam when he was actually writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24120">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24121">, and we spent many an afternoon in Malibu talking about the West from Peckinpah’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24122">It was quite an extraordinary time in my life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24123">Peckinpah’s style, his mastery of storytelling, was an incredible education in the art of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24124">Especially the way he introduced and set up certain story points.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24125">The other filmmaker I studied was the magnificent, revolutionary, and influential Michelangelo Antonioni. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24126">The Italian director is a master of setting up and weaving emotional attitudes and characterizations throughout his films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24127">I was so impressed and inspired when I saw </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24128">La Notte (The Night)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24129">, that I literally began my writing career with it, and thus entered the world of contemporary film. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24130">La Notte</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24131"> is masterful study about the relationship and values of a well-to-do Italian couple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24132">The way Antonioni sets up his characters, his mastery of the situation, the visual expressions of behavior, were revolutionary in terms of film, and when you see any of his films today, they stand firmly on the timeless pedestal of great film art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24133">During the last few years I’ve had the privilege of getting to know Antonioni (he’s the only director I address as Maestro), and I’m as much in awe of him today as I ever was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24134">The way he sets up an emotional situation in just a few visual strokes is phenomenal.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24135">These filmmakers taught me everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24136">And, as mentioned, I was so struck with Peckinpah’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24137">Ride the High Country</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24138"> that I decided that this was what great screenwriting was all about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24139">So when I managed to get hold of the script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24140">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24141"> (written by Peckinpah with Oscar Saul), I think I must have read it at least a hundred times, analyzing it, taking it apart, memorizing it scene by scene, action by action, character by character, trying to understand what made it tick and what made it work so successfully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24142">It was a wonderful education.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24143">The script, like so many of Peckinpah’s films, was a Western (he loved the theme of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24144">“unchanged men in a changing time,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24145"> which he incorporated in almost every film he did), and takes place right after the Civil War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24146">The story concerns an obsessed renegade Union officer, Charlton Heston, who refuses to accept the peace between the North and South even though the war is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24147">A major in the Confederate army, he fled to Mexico rather than accept the peace treaty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24148">He’s determined to fight his own war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24149">In this case he breaks a group of misfits out of prison and together they hunt the band of Apaches responsible for the slaughter that opens the screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24150">The script opens at a ranch on the frontier on Halloween. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24151">The men, women, and children are preparing for the large celebration and it’s a joyous and festive time, with the children playing “cowboys and Indians” in makeshift holiday masks and warpaint, as the grown-ups dance and enjoy themselves getting ready for the evening’s feast.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24152">But as the children play their games, we suddenly start cross-cutting between the costumed children and a band of renegade Apaches creeping toward the ranch house in what will eventually turn into a bloody massacre. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24153">The fierceness of their faces, emblazoned in war paint, contrasted with the children’s decorated faces, and surrounded with the festive music of the fiddles playing and the people dancing, is as visually striking as it is terrifying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24154">When the massacre begins, the laughs and squeals of the children are interwoven with the war cries of the attacking Apaches, resulting in a truly memorable sequence.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24155">The opening is a remarkable example of the power and magic of film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24156">(Unfortunately, because of budgetary problems, the studio brutally recut the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24157">Peckinpah wanted to take his name off it, but the studio prevailed.) It is this particular incident, the inciting incident, that sets up the entire film, and the story line is a reaction to this event, tracing the obsession of the renegade Union officer, Major Dundee (Heston), who relentlessly tracks down the Apaches, hoping to avenge the massacre of the homesteaders.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24158">The script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24159">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24160"> is a wonderful illustration of how to set up the dramatic premise of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24161">Sometimes, going back over the material you’ve written, you may find a scene or a sequence that seems unclear, or maybe you think the dialogue needs to be sharpened, or another scene added to clarify the narrative or define the character, and many times the problem can be solved by making sure that certain story elements have been set up appropriately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24162">Setting up necessary story elements, then paying them off, allows you to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24163">No moments are too small or too subtle to be set up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24164">If these points are not set up appropriately, the reader will sometimes shift his or her focus away from the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24165">And this, of course, results in a “problem.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24166">There are a several good examples of how you set things up in order to pay them off later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24167">If you do want to set something up, think of it as a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24168">“noun”;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24169"> you’re going to be setting up a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24170">“person, place, or thing,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24171"> either a character, or a situation, or an object. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24172">As mentioned, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24173">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24174"> is a great example: the gun Thelma puts into her purse at the beginning of the film is paid off at Plot Point I when Harlan is shot in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24175">In that case it was setting up an object, or “thing.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24176">Setting up her character, in order to expand the situation, is revealed later when Louise was raped in Texas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24177">As a matter of fact, when you read the screenplay of this film, everything is carefully set up from the very beginning; Louise’s relationship with her boyfriend, Jimmy, actually the back story that results in the two women going to the mountains for the weekend; and tracing the emotional arc of Thelma’s growth from being locked in her marriage with Darryl in the opening allows her to grow into a free-thinking, independent woman.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24178">When and where to set up things in a scene, sequence, or act, and when, where, and how to pay them off, means knowing your story and characters well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24179">If you don’t know the basic and essential elements of your story line, or if you’re vague and unclear about the progression of events, or the character’s arc, this lack of information, this lack of preparation, will often create problems in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24180">This is really what writing’s all about, asking yourself the right questions so you can reach levels that keep the story moving forward with depth and dimension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24181">It creates a framework of universality around your work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24182">This is your responsibility as writer; if you don’t know what’s going on in your story, then who does?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24183">There are times in the screenplay when a particular piece of information, or a physical item, is set up in one scene, and then paid off in the very next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24184">Or the information or object can be paid off several scenes later, or even later than that, as is the case in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24185">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24186"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24187">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24188">.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24189">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24190">Shawshank</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24191">, at Plot Point I, Andy Dufresne approaches Red for the first time and asks if he can get him a rock hammer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24192">Red asks some questions about it, and through Andy’s answers we begin to see and understand a little bit about his character; on the outside, before he was sent to prison, he was a “rock hound.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24193">That, of course, sets up an important piece of information we need to know, that will be paid off at the end of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24194">Later, we see the hammer being “delivered,” and then, as Act II unfolds, the rock hammer, and rock cloths, are only referred to, and shown in a few shots. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24195">After we’ve seen the hammer a few times, it’s something we simply take for granted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24196">Only at Plot Point II is the rock hammer really paid off and we “see,” through the flashback, how Andy escaped from prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24197">Suddenly, all those little scenes and references make a lot of sense.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24198">What happens when you don’t set up these story points properly, or pay them off appropriately? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24199">You’ll notice that the story line appears to lose momentum and seems to wander around in search of itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24200">When I’m reading a script and I feel my focus shifting and my interest waning, I start looking for what’s going on, the “through line” of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24201">If I don’t find it, if I have to keep looking for what the story’s about, that’s an indication that something’s missing; either a particular story point or a character or an object needs to be set up, or accentuated more.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24202">The symptoms of a failure to set things up properly are pretty obvious, and different for every screenplay, of course, but they all share some similar traits; take a look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24203">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24204">, and you’ll see that problems of this nature seem to make the material </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24205">soft</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24206">, so it might seem that there’s a lack of conflict, or the story line has no focus and wanders around looking for direction, insight, and clarity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24207">Sometimes various story points will be introduced and then left hanging and unresolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24208">As you’re rereading the material, you’ll probably find yourself asking, “What happened to this or that point?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24209">or “What’s this story really about?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24210">so the action appears to be washed out and the story unfolds on a single narrative line without any dimension, tension, or suspense.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24211">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24212">Things that are set up have to be paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24213">Structure, as we’ve seen, is the relationship between the parts and the whole, and each part is directly related to the whole, so if you set something up, whether it’s a story point, or situation, or a particular object, it has to be paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24214">Otherwise, whatever you’ve set up doesn’t make any sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24215">Can you imagine a film like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24216">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24217"> (Anthony Minghella) working as well as it did without the principal issues of the story line in relationship to the characters having been set up?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24218">If you feel there’s a problem because something has not been set up properly, or paid off, go back into the material and determine where you set it up, and then how it’s paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24219">Whether it helped to set up the story’s premise, or a particular plot element, find out the specific location where you first introduced it, then how you did it, and whether through a visual image or in an exchange of dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24220">We can learn so much from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24221">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24222"> in terms of setting up the dramatic premise and the inciting incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24223">As mentioned earlier, the opening sequence incorporates three threads of dramatic action; one, Andy Dufresne is sitting outside in his car drinking, when he takes the gun out of his glove compartment as we witness his wife and her lover in the house wrapped in an erotic embrace; two, we see him on trial being cross-examined by the prosecutor for the murder of his wife and her lover; and, and three, the judge sentences him to two life terms back to back, and then we cut to the prison, where we’re introduced to Red.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24224">That’s the first ten pages of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24225">In the second ten pages he enters prison and we see things through his eyes; this audience-character bond allows us to identify with him and what he’s going through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24226">Audience and character should always be united by the dramatic action; the audience learns as the character learns what’s going on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24227">At this point in the story I really didn’t know whether Andy Dufresne was guilty or innocent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24228">But as the story line unfolded, it really didn’t matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24229">At Plot Point I, the first moment he approaches Red to request the rock hammer, he learns the “truth”; in prison, everybody’s innocent, so as I was watching the film, it never really occurred to me to wonder whether he was innocent or guilty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24230">That wasn’t the story; the story was about his relationship with Red and how he adapts to life inside prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24231">It’s only later, at Pinch II, when Tommy tells him that a former cell mate had confessed to committing the murder of his wife and lover, that we understand Andy is really innocent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24232">And while this is set up within the first ten pages of the screenplay, Andy’s actual guilt or innocence is not paid off until almost the end of Act II.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24233">So what’s your story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24234">Have you set it up properly in the first ten pages? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24235">If you feel there’s a problem in setting up something, go back into the material and see what it is that you’ve failed to establish. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24236">What needs to be set up? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24237">Is it essential to the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24238">Is it a story point within the script, or a “thing,” like the gun in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24239">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24240">, or the rock hammer in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24241">Shawshank</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24242">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24243">Or maybe it’s an integral part of the character that needs to be set up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24244">Or maybe it’s answering the question of what happened and why the plane is shot down and crashes at the beginning of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24245">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24246">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24247">It’s up to you as the writer to clarify and define what it is that needs to be set up, and then go back into the script and determine the best way to solve that particular problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24248">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24249">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24250"> the story is set up from the opening scene of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24251">A news reporter is shown at sea on an aircraft carrier and he explains, with the help of actual newsreel footage, that a band of Russian rebels have taken over the government and are threatening to launch a nuclear attack against the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24252">In response, the nuclear sub </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24253">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24254"> is ordered to sea, and Act I is devoted to setting up the Russian threat, introducing and setting up the Denzel Washington character—Hunter, the XO—and the Gene Hackman character—Ramsey, the captain of the vessel—and preparing the sub for its mission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24255">At Plot Point I the sub casts off and begins its underwater mission.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24256">That basically sets up the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24257">But there’s another dimension here, and that’s the setting up of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24258">I’ve already mentioned Captain Ramsey’s dog, and how the little Jack Russell terrier goes everywhere with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24259">It’s a wonderful touch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24260">But the Hunter character is somewhat different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24261">First of all, we learn that he spent a year at Harvard, which makes him “suspicious” in the eyes of Ramsey; he’s an “intellectual,” and that sets up a situation that might create problems with Ramsey’s journeyman ethics as the captain of the nuclear sub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24262">More important, however, is when Ramsey asks Hunter about his likes or hobbies, and Hunter replies that he rides horses. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24263">“What’s the best horse you’ve ever ridden?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24264">Ramsey asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24265">“Arabian,” Hunter replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24266">That impresses Ramsey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24267">Just a little exchange, and, at first glance it could easily be a throwaway line, something to just illuminate the difference in character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24268">But that line about the horses is introduced where it is so it can help set up the clash between the two characters that explodes at Mid-Point; because the radio has been damaged when the emergency action message has been cut off before it is complete.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24269">The First Half of Act II deals with expanding the characters and clarifying their points of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24270">Drama is conflict, remember, so one of the first scenes in this unit of dramatic action shows the officers sitting at their first meal, in a scene said to have been written by Robert Towne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24271">Hunter is the new member of the crew, so the captain, Ramsey, is trying to find out what his philosophy of war is, and what kind of “man” his new XO is, what he believes in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24272">The difference between “you and me,” Ramsey explains, is that when “I was taught, things were simpler in a war situation; I was taught how to push a button and told when to do it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24273">It’s not a question of strategy, he states, but simply a matter of military and political procedure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24274">And he quotes von Clausewitz. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24275">He pauses for a moment, then continues his observation: it’s different now, he says; the brass, meaning the Pentagon, want you (referring to Hunter) to know “why you’re doing it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24276">The Denzel Washington character nods in agreement, then responds “that in a nuclear world the true enemy can’t be destroyed, because the real enemy is war itself.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24277">This little dialogue exchange succinctly summarizes the differences in their philosophies of war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24278">It also shows us the differences in their points of view, because it is this conflict that fuels the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24279">If the differences in their points of view had not been set up and established, the entire story would fail to work; there would be no conflict, no mutiny attempt, no story, and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24280">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24281"> would just cruise the waters until the situation in Russia resolved itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24282">Basically, their differing points of view would be like two parallel lines moving toward infinity without ever connecting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24283">That’s not how you build and structure a screenplay.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24284">Some screenwriters might argue that the scene is too direct, too obvious, and they would either omit it or write it in a more subtle way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24285">But some scenes in a screenplay have to be written directly, no matter how obvious, or expository, they are, and this happens to be one of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24286">It is set up to be paid off later so it can follow the natural law of cause and effect, action and reaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24287">If the essential seed of the screenplay is planted appropriately, in the right place and at the right time, it can blossom into a full-grown narrative, replete with the structural and character dimension.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24288">It’s all in how you set it up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24289">Establishing Hunter’s interest in riding horses in the very beginning, the third scene of the screenplay to be exact, sets us up for what follows. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24290">When the conflict between their characters explodes at Mid-Point, Ramsey insists they follow the orders received to launch ten nuclear missiles against Russia rather than wait for the confirmation of the incomplete second emergency action message received. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24291">This results in Hunter’s taking over the sub and placing Ramsey under arrest.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24292">Later, when a small group of men regain control of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24293">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24294"> for Ramsey the radio is almost repaired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24295">Ramsey gives Hunter three minutes for the radio to be fixed so the message can be completed; if, at the end of three minutes, the message is not received, he’s going to launch the missiles as ordered.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24296">So begins a long three-minute wait. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24297">It’s an ideal moment for tension and suspense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24298">In the scene, which it is said that Quentin Tarantino wrote, Ramsey asks Hunter if he knows about the Lipizzaner stallions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24299">They’re all white, he adds, almost as an afterthought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24300">Hunter nods, yes, he knows about them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24301">Again, this kind of dialogue emphasizes their character differences; it illuminates that one of them is “right,” and one of them is “wrong.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24302">When the EAM message is finally received, it orders the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24303">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24304"> to cancel the previous orders of the nuclear missile strike. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24305">Hunter has been proven “right.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24306">This “right” and “wrong” scenario is then resolved, or paid off, in the last scene of the film, the little tag. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24307">The military tribunal assembled to weigh evidence in the case of the two men, clearly determines that both men “were right” in their actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24308">What they did only points up the ambiguity of the military law that was then on the books. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24309">As they stand outside the courthouse, Hunter pays off the horse scene that was set up early in the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24310">He tells the captain that the Lipizzaner stallions are from Spain, not Portugal, and at birth, they are black, not white. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24311">(See explanation </span><a class="calibre4" href="#calibre_link-104"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24312">this page</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24313">.) Another case of “being right,” as it reflects the basic conflict in the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24314">It is a powerful statement, made more powerful in the way it is set up at the very beginning.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24315">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24316"> is a very good film and it reflects the nature of the classic “tragic situation.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24317">Hegel, the nineteenth-century German philosopher, always proclaimed that the true nature of tragedy is not a conflict between “good and evil,” or “right and wrong,” but resides in the conflict between “good versus good,” or “right versus right.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24318">Both sides of the conflict are right in the actions they pursue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24319">And </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24320">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24321"> personifies this in an exciting and entertaining presentation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24322">It’s a very good film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24323">The setting up and paying off of story points is integral to the art and craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24324">Every scene, every sequence, every Plot Point and story point, must be set up, established, and then, at the right moment, paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24325">Nothing can be set up without later being paid off.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24382">In William Goldman’s book </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24383">Adventures in the Screen Trade</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24384">, he talks about the best place to enter the scene, and to hypothetically illustrate his point he gives an example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24385">Suppose, he says, you’re writing a scene in which a reporter is interviewing a subject, and it’s laid out like this: The reporter arrives at the place of the interview, the two introduce themselves to each other, get comfortable, chat for a while, and after a few moments the reporter suggests they start the interview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24386">So he turns on the cassette recorder, pulls out his notepad, and starts asking his questions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24387">They discuss the topic, going back and forth for a while until the reporter is satisfied and terminates the discussion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24388">He turns off the recorder, thanks the subject, picks up his belongings and prepares to leave, says his good-bye, and walks to the door. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24389">But when he reaches the door, he suddenly stops as if struck with an afterthought, turns back to the subject, and says, “Oh, by the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24390">One last question…”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24391">Where is the best place for the screenwriter to enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24392">When the reporter arrives? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24393">When he turns on his recorder? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24394">At some point during the interview? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24395">At the end? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24396">None of the above, Goldman says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24397">Instead, he feels the best place for the screenwriter to enter the scene is when the reporter is standing at the door, on his way out, and remembers “one last question.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24398">Every screenwriter deliberates this question, mulls it over and over, and finally, at some point, decides where to enter the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24399">What’s the best point to enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24400">When I first read this in Goldman’s book it always struck me as being a good rule of thumb, so when I was writing my book </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24401">Selling a Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24402">, I thought I might give it a try just to see what happened.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24403">I had an interview with Peter Guber scheduled, just before he took over control of Sony Pictures, so I decided to see whether Goldman’s advice worked in real life as well as in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24404">We met in his office on a beautiful cloudy day in L.A., and I had a list of questions laid out in my notepad, and we spent an informative session together discussing what a buyer looks for when a company is considering purchasing material.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24405">When I completed the interview and it came time to leave, I turned off the cassette recorder, got up, and put on my jacket. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24406">I walked to the door, then I paused, turned to him, and said, “Oh, by the way, one last question: Why do some movies get made and others don’t?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24407">Which had been my key question right from the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24408">He laughed, and asked why I’m wearing the jacket I’m wearing, and why is he wearing the jacket he’s wearing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24409">Still standing at the door, we started talking about the market and personal taste, but as he started getting into it and answering my question, I took off my jacket, sat back down, and turned the cassette recorder back on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24410">Peter Guber is a pretty amazing, as well as astute, producer and we sat there for another forty-five minutes talking about why some movies get made and others don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24411">It was really a fascinating discussion and provided the most intriguing and insightful part of the interview with Peter Guber. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24412">And most of the chapter on producers draws upon this part of the interview and gives great insight into the moviemaking process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24413">I use this interview in many of my screenwriting courses as an example to help clarify and define the best point at which to enter the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24414">So many times a screenwriter starts a scene and fills it with unnecessary dialogue that basically says nothing, and by the time the purpose of the scene is revealed, the scene is way too long and whatever dramatic tension should have been, or might have been there, is lost in a plethora of empty dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24415">So, what’s the best point to enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24416">A good rule of thumb is to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24417">“enter late and get out early.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24418"> Which means that in many scenes (depending on their purpose) it’s best to enter the action at the last possible moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24419">I usually tell my students that you enter the scene about two lines before the purpose of the scene is revealed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24420">In this way you only need a minimum of dialogue to state the dramatic purpose.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24421">Now this, of course, is only a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24422">general rule;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24423"> it doesn’t apply to every scene in the screenplay, because the dramatic function of each scene is singular and unique. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24424">Some scenes have to be constructed, or built, in terms of their beginning, middle, and end, and it always depends on what information you need to communicate, either to move the story forward, or to satisfy the dramatic purpose of the particular scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24425">Where you enter the scene is absolutely an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24426">individual decision</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24427">, and hopefully the scene itself will dictate the best point to enter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24428">If you’re able to see it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24429">The same principle applies to ending the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24430">At what point do you leave one scene so you can move into the next? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24431">The main things to remember about getting out of one scene and into the next are: First get out with a sense of tension so the reader will want to see what happens next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24432">Second, make the transition from one scene into the next interesting, visually arresting, smooth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24433">Remember that it’s the writer’s responsibility to keep the reader turning pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24434">If you write a scene that is complete unto itself, it will have a definite beginning, middle, and end, and if you do that consistently, you’ll end up with an episodic, or sequential, screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24435">Every scene has a definite end, a definite place to get out; you just have to find it, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s transitional, or deliberate (like a fade-out). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24436">Every scene should lead into the next one, like a force of nature, spring turning into summer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24437">The connection between these units of dramatic action, whether effected by picture-to-picture, sound-to-sound, dialogue-to-dialogue, or special-effect-to-special-effect transitions, should always be pulling and guiding you from one scene into the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24438">The story must always move forward, from beginning to end, beginning to end.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24439">Just look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24440">The English Patient;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24441"> the relationship between the two lovers is the focal point of the story, and how the love affair grows and blossoms between the Ralph Fiennes (Almásy) and Kristin Scott Thomas (Katherine) characters is always unfolding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24442">As Fiennes is languishing on his deathbed, vividly recalling his memories, we learn what happened between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24443">The script itself is a distinct mosaic being pieced together by the context of their emotional relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24444">So the end of the film is seen at the beginning of the film, a “bookend” device that works wonderfully.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24445">In order to keep the tension going, and keep the reader turning pages, enter late and get out early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24446">That’s what screenwriting is all about.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24447">If you don’t pay attention to the point at which you enter the scene, there is a possibility that your screenplay will drag and sag, or be too long, so that the sense of tension and suspense is lost, and if that happens, the chances are you’ll be overwhelmed with problems of a script that is not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24448">This is really not too unusual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24449">Many times I’ve received screenplays that are very long, well over a hundred and fifty pages, and as I go through the material, the first thing I notice is that the screenwriters have usually started their scenes too early and have had to fill them with unnecessary dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24450">You know: “How are you? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24451">Nice to see you again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24452">Won’t you sit down? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24453">What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24454">When and where you enter the scene is the central question as you set about structuring each particular moment of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24455">To do that you need to ask yourself certain questions: What is the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24456">Why is it there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24457">Does it move the story forward? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24458">Does it reveal information about the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24459">Is it driven by the need for exposition, or transition? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24460">If you don’t know the answers to these questions, who does?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24461">There are many times when the scenes are too long and episodic and the writer has to rethink and create a new approach to them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24462">What is the problem? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24463">If it’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24464">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24465">, you have to approach it from one perspective; if </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24466">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24467">, from another; and if it’s a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24468">Structural</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24469"> problem, still another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24470">The writer can approach the problem by first breaking the scene down into its component parts, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24471">beginning, middle</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24472">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24473">end</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24474">, and then spend time rethinking the elements of the scene; describing the location, what it looks like, the various aspects or dynamics of character that need to be revealed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24475">By refocusing on these components, it’s easy to judge whether you are entering too early or too late. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24476">If too early you’ll probably find the scene is approximately two or three pages long and top heavy with trite and unimportant dialogue, redundant and verbose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24477">Yet there are other times, when you enter too late, where the true dramatic purpose is unrealized, and then the scene comes out short and the story line seems vague and unfulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24478">Every scene, as we know, has a definite beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24479">If you have a problem that answers to some of the symptoms listed on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24480">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24481">, restructure and redefine the scene into its basic parts of beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24482">This way you can reevaluate some of those long scenes that seem to achieve no dramatic purpose except to slow the narrative down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24483">The same exercise can be used if the scenes are too short and don’t give enough information to move the story forward.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24484">How do you determine the best place to enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24485">That’s the real question. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24486">I think the only way to gauge this is to ask yourself what happens before the scene begins, what happens during the scene, and what happens after the scene is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24487">Whether your scene takes place in an office, or at a concert, or in a car, where does the scene begin, what is its middle, and how does it end?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24488">Let’s say you have an important scene that’s too long, too wordy, and drags the action down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24489">And let’s say, just as an example, that your scene takes place in an office. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24490">The first question to ask yourself is where is your character coming from before the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24491">From his or her office? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24492">From a meeting outside the office? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24493">From home or the airport? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24494">What is the purpose of the scene, and what function does it serve? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24495">In other words, why is it there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24496">And from the other characters’ point of view, what are they doing when your character enters the office? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24497">Are they in the middle of a phone call or conversation? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24498">What’s the back story to the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24499">Are there any pleasantries exchanged? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24500">Or are the characters irritated and pissed off? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24501">When the characters enter the office, maybe your main character might be asked to wait before entering in turn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24502">Conflict, remember? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24503">Getting your character into the office would be the beginning of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24504">So you could enter the scene anywhere along the flow of physical action of getting the character to the office.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24505">The middle would be the actual conversation taking place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24506">What’s the conversation about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24507">How does it fit within the context of the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24508">What function does it serve? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24509">Does it move the story forward or does it reveal information about the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24510">Is it a dramatically charged scene, or is it mainly subtext, meaning that what’s not said is more important than what is said?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24511">As far as I’m concerned, subtext should, if possible, become a major part of each scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24512">For example, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24513">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24514">, a formal dinner party is being given and Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her husband, Colin, are getting ready to leave. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24515">The war is becoming a reality and getting too close and their archeological expedition has been shut down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24516">Now, we know that Almásy and Katherine are deeply in love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24517">The scene opens with the group seated around the long table, when Almásy walks through the door drunk and, with only a few lines of dialogue, makes a total fool of himself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24518">The dramatic purpose of the scene is not found in the dialogue, it is seen in what is not said: the looks, the uncomfortable glances from Katherine; her husband, tense and uptight; and the other people there trying to endure the embarrassing behavior of Almásy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24519">It is during this scene that Colin, Katherine’s husband, suspects, maybe knows, that his wife and Almásy are having an affair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24520">From Almásy’s point of view, he knows he has fallen hopelessly in love with her, does not want her to leave, and cannot stand to see her with her husband. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24521">It’s a beautiful scene that on an obvious level shows us the drunken words and gestures of a person who is hurting deep inside, but more importantly conveys the character’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions by the words that are not said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24522">The dialogue itself during this encounter is really irrelevant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24523">That’s subtext.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24524">Getting back to our office scene, what happens at the end? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24525">Does the character say his or her good-byes and simply leave? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24526">Does the character go back to his or her own office, leave the building, or get into a car or cab and then we move into the next scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24527">In other words, what’s the ending of the scene?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24528">When my students find themselves in this dilemma, and have to deal with this kind of problem, I have them break down the scene and lay out the parameters of beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24529">Again, what is the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24530">Where does it take place? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24531">How does the character get into the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24532">When those answers are known, then I have them list these events on a separate piece of paper so they can determine which elements lead up to the character’s entering the scene, what events take place during the scene, and what happens when the scene is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24533">When they have completed this little exercise on a separate piece of paper, they have three complete columns of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24534">beginning, middle</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24535">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24536">end</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24537">, for these events lead up to, are part of, and conclude the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24538">Then I ask them to examine the characters’ emotional state. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24539">What are the characters thinking and feeling before they enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24540">Is there an emotional subtext? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24541">What is their dramatic need in this particular scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24542">What do they really want to say (basically stating the purpose of the scene), and what is said to them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24543">If there’s any doubt or question in the students’ minds, I have them write the scene out in an obvious and direct way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24544">What is this scene really about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24545">Just write it and don’t worry about whether it says what you want it to say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24546">There’s still time for that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24547">Sometimes I’ll have them do this in a free-association essay, of a couple of paragraphs or a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24548">This is only background to the scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24549">Then, move on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24550">What is the character’s point of view during the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24551">Does it alter or affect the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24552">How so? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24553">What about the other person(s) in the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24554">What are their thoughts, feelings, and emotions before the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24555">And what is their point of view during the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24556">What is their dramatic need in the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24557">Do they achieve it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24558">Every character in the scene has a different agenda, a different dramatic need, and it’s important, absolutely essential, for writers to know what that need is so they can express it either visually or through dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24559">If you’re unclear about what the relationship is between the characters interacting in the scene, write a short two- or three-page essay about them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24560">Free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24561">What is their relationship? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24562">Where or how did they meet? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24563">What is their purpose in being together? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24564">Do they like or dislike each other? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24565">What is their point of view? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24566">What is it that keeps them together? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24567">Where did they come from before the scene begins, and again, what thoughts, feelings, or emotions do they carry into the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24568">Why are they there and what do they want to get or achieve in the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24569">All these points should be determined so you can enter the scene at the best moment dramatically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24570">Once you know the answers to these questions, then enter the scene a few lines before the purpose of the scene is stated.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24571">Enter late and get out early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24572">It makes for a good reading experience, as well as moving the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24573">Here’s a example from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24574">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24575">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24576">It’s a scene that takes place in the First Half of Act II, and occurs right after the tarring-of-the-roof sequence when Andy tells the prison guard Hadley how to keep the $35,000 he inherited from his brother and, in exchange, manages to obtain some beer for his fellow inmates, which he does not drink. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24577">Be aware of the scene in terms of beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24637">And we cut to the next scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24638">This little scene is a masterpiece of understatement, and though short, it reveals many different facets of their character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24639">Even though the scene is taken out of context, it is an insightful illustration of entering late and getting out early.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24640">First, what’s the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24641">You could say there are a couple of things here; first and foremost the scene reveals information about the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24642">As mentioned, this particular scene takes place near the beginning of the Second Act, so it’s really a scene about them solidifying their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24643">As Red says, “I guess we’re gettin’ to be friends, ain’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24644">We can also see the difference between Andy and Red, in terms of background and interests; they’re playing checkers, a game that most everyone knows, but Andy would rather be playing chess and as far as Red is concerned, chess is “totally fuckin’ inexplicable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24645">Hate that game,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24646">So much for that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24647">What it does reveal is a vast difference in terms of their backgrounds and interests. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24648">The two men met because Andy wanted to obtain a rock hammer and to further pursue his interests as a rock hound, he wants to carve the chess pieces himself, “one side done in quartz…the opposing side in limestone.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24649">This says something about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24650">He was probably raised in a solid middle-class or upper-middle-class family, he’s intelligent, logical, a good craftsman, he pays close attention to detail, likes to make things, and is always looking to see how things work by taking them apart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24651">He’s a hands-on kind of person, and of course Red’s line about “scratching his name on the wall” is setting us up for the way he escapes from Shawshank Prison.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24652">But there’s another element in this scene as well: when Red asks why he killed his wife, Andy replies humorously, “I’m innocent, remember? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24653">Just like everybody else in here.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24654">And the stage directions say that “Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24655">Andy senses this and asks, “What are you in for, Red?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24656">“Murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24657">Same as you.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24658">“Innocent?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24659">Andy inquires, smiling slightly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24660">But Red is serious: “The only guilty man in Shawshank.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24661">We hold for a moment, then cut to the next scene.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24662">The scene ends on a statement that really raises more questions than it answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24663">Whom did Red murder? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24664">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24665">How old was he when he committed the crime? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24666">What were the circumstances surrounding his act? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24667">We leave the scene before we have any answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24668">We get out at a moment of thoughtfulness, a natural end to this particular scene, but it spurs us on to know more about Red. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24669">Only later do we learn about the crime that brought Red to Shawshank. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24670">But entering late and getting out early keeps the tension going and the reader turning pages.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24671">It’s a good “rule” to remember.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24672">If we wanted to break this scene into the elements of beginning, middle, and end, it would begin with Andy and Red in the yard, walking up the bleacher steps, laying out the checkerboard and pieces, and they would start playing the game. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24673">The middle would deal with the game itself, and the dialogue would play, as it does, over the action of checker moves of the two men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24674">The end would be when the game is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24675">They’d pack up their goods, either with dialogue or in silence, and they would walk back to the cell block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24676">They’re getting closer as friends, but there’s still a distance between them, otherwise Andy would have answered Red’s question on a more serious note. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24677">It’s the manner in which he says it that implies that he actually committed the crime, and of course, that’s what we’re being set up to believe.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24678">The scene is structured so we begin toward the end of the middle section. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24679">“King me,” Red says in the opening line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24680">Which means they’ve been playing awhile, because you don’t king someone in checkers until you’ve made several moves to get into the right position. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24681">So the scene opens toward the end of the middle section and that’s exactly what this little dialogue exchange is; a little “window” allowing us to learn what we’re supposed to learn about their characters, and then moving on.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24682">That’s where we enter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24683">And we get out early, after the last thought, Red’s admission of guilt, is stated but before it’s completed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24684">If the author had wanted to continue the scene, Andy would have asked Red why and how he committed the murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24685">But he doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24686">We don’t learn that until much later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24687">We entered the scene late and then we got out early, before the explanation of how and why Red did what he did.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24688">Where you enter depends upon the dramatic purpose of the scene, and where you end it depends on what you’re leading into for the next scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24689">Structuring the scene so you enter late and get out early is what keeps the action moving forward smoothly, seamlessly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24690">When I read a good screenplay, the reading experience is smooth and easy, and the pages have an almost liquid texture, with each scene continually moving the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24691">The only way I can describe it is by saying a good read is like “honey on the page.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24692">And a good read is what we’re all looking for.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24738">That’s the line that begins the Third Act of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24739">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24740">, one of the most significant action films of the last decade. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24741">Not only is the action singular and the characters sound, but it is the uniqueness of James Cameron’s vision that drives the film into our consciousness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24742">The same holds true with any great film, whether it be an action-adventure, science-fiction, or mystery thriller, or simply a great action sequence nailed into the scenario of a good drama or detective story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24743">The Star Wars trilogy has been rereleased with astonishing results, once again proving that the action film, accompanied by the mythic vision of the filmmaker, is what truly drives the film into our collective celluloid immortality.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24744">The action film is actually a significant staple of our movie fare, and at least half of a major studio’s production schedule is devoted to developing and nurturing this particular brand of entertainment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24745">And now, with the advent of the computer-graphic revolution, it’s only going to become more popular. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24746">Writing the action film, or even an action sequence, is really an art unto itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24747">So many times I read screenplays whose pages are filled with nonstop action—in fact, there is so much action that it becomes dull and repetitive, with little or no characterization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24748">The reader, and the viewer, are overwhelmed and numb. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24749">Sometimes, it’s a good action script with strong individual action sequences, but the premise is weak and derivative of earlier films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24750">In other words, we’ve seen it all before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24751">It needs a “new look,” or a more interesting concept. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24752">And when that happens, you’re in trouble.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24753">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24754">Because there are problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24755">Lots of problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24756">Either with the plot, or the characters, or the action itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24757">Some writers have a natural ability to write action films, and there are others who are more comfortable writing character, but it’s important to note that before you can write any kind of an action film, or sequence, it’s essential to understand what an action film is, what its nature is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24758">I had a student who wrote a screenplay about a navy pilot sent on a mission to a foreign country to rescue a kidnapped scientist being held hostage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24759">It’s a good premise, and there were several opportunities to create some notable action sequences and keep the story moving forward at a fast pace. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24760">So that’s what he did, and his entire screenplay was one action sequence after another; the story moved like lightning, but it didn’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24761">What he didn’t do was create an interesting main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24762">Because he didn’t know his main character, most of the dialogue consisted of expository elements designed to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24763">It didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24764">We didn’t know anything about this person sent to rescue the scientist, had no idea about his thoughts or feelings, or about the forces working on his life.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24765">This is not all that uncommon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24766">When you’re writing an action screenplay, the focus must be on the action </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24767">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24768"> character; the two must reside in and interact with each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24769">Otherwise there are going to be problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24770">What usually happens is that the action overpowers the story and diminishes the characters, resulting in a screenplay that, no matter how well written, is flat and uninteresting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24771">There has to be an appropriate balance of peaks and valleys, places in the material where the reader and audience can pause and catch their collective breath.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24772">So, what do we have to know in order to avoid creating these problems in an action screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24773">Let’s start from the top. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24774">Action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24775"> is defined in the dictionary as “a movement or a series of movements,” or “the state of being in motion,” so film, a medium that moves at twenty-four frames per second, is a natural medium for “showing” action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24776">Writing an action script, or sequence, is a definite skill, and good action scripts are written with color, pacing, suspense, tension, and, in most cases, humor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24777">Remember the Bruce Willis character mumbling to himself in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24778">Die Hard</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24779"> (Steven de Souza) or the bus making the leap across the enormous freeway chasm in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24780">Speed</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24781"> (Graham Yost)? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24782">We remember good action films like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24783">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24784"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24785">The Fugitive</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24786"> (David Twohy) or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24787">The Hunt for Red October</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24788"> (Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart) by the uniqueness of the action, but we usually forget all the cool car chases and explosions that occupy the majority of action films that fill our theaters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24789">They all look alike.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24790">The key to writing any action film lies in writing the action sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24791">(Plot and character come later.)

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24814">What is it that makes a good action film great? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24815">The electricity of the action sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24816">Remember the chase scene from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24817">Bullitt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24818">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24819">Or “the walk” at the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24820">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24821">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24822">Or Butch and Sundance jumping into the river’s gorge after being relentlessly chased by the Super Posse in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24823">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24824">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24825">The list goes on and on.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24927">If your script doesn’t seem to be working as well as it should, or you have some problem areas in terms of pacing, or it seems dull and boring, you might think about adding some kind of action sequence to keep the story moving and the tension taut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24928">Examine the material and see whether the proposed action will blend in with your original concept. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24929">Your script is only a start point; sometimes you have to make some drastic creative choices to allow you to fix your film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24930">But always remember that you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24931">can’t just throw in an action sequence because your story line drags and sags, or is dull and boring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24932">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24933">To approach any action film or sequence, the material has to be designed for and incorporated into your story line and be executed to the best of your ability.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24934">In today’s market I think it’s essential that every screenwriter should know how to write a good action sequence, no matter what kind of film he or she is working on; whether a character study like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24935">Shine</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24936"> (Jan Sardi), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24937">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24938">, or Lone </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24939">Star</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24940"> (John Sayles), even a comedy like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24941">Michael</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24942"> (Nora Ephron). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24943">You’ll find that most of the screenplays funneled through the studio pipeline will have some kind of action sequence woven into the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24944">The trick is to make sure it fits into the overall concept and design. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24945">I can’t stress this enough.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24946">There are many problems in screenwriting that can be solved by a knowledge of good action writing, but there is always the tendency to sacrifice character for action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24947">The trick is to weave the two together in such a way that the characters support the action, and the action supports the characters. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24948">Crimson Tide, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24949">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24950">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24951"> are good examples in which the action and characters complement each other.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24952">In my many travels and workshops I meet a lot of writers who confide in me that they have difficulty crafting an action sequence; when I ask why, their answers, generally, are the same: because film is really “a director’s medium,” they say, anything they do will be ignored anyway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24953">If I probe a little deeper, it turns out that, depending on what their strengths or weaknesses are, it’s because they don’t want to write everything out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24954">As a result they will be the first to admit that their efforts lack focus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24955">Either that or they write such detailed action that it becomes bogged down in a lot of words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24956">The result is usually what I term </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24957">“thick pages,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24958"> pages that are so dense, they’re difficult to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24959">In the nineties and beyond, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to design the action scene or sequence in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24960">You can’t give that responsibility to the director; it’s your job to write the best action you can.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24961">It wasn’t always that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24962">In the sixties and seventies a screenwriter could simply write the words </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24963">There is a chase</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24964">, and the director would do the rest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24965">One of the most memorable action scenes in the action genre was written that way—the dynamic chase sequence in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24966">The French Connection</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24967"> (Ernest Tidyman) stunningly directed by William Friedkin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24968">No longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24969">Today, action sequences have to be designed and choreographed with the utmost care, skill, and patience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24970">So, how do you write a good action sequence?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24971">William Wisher </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24972">(Terminator 2, Judge Dredd)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24973"> says that “ideally, the action is on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24974">It’s a very smart thing to do because the script serves different purposes at different times in the [filmmaking] process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24975">The first people who read it are going to be the producers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24976">Your job is to get them to actually see the movie on the page and get them excited enough to write you a big check so that you can make the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24977">The second group of people who read your script are directors and actors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24978">Your job with them is to not just get them excited, but to give them a sense of character and structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24979">There should be enough information to let the actors know how to play their roles and give the director an understanding of how the movie should be made.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24980">There’s a fine line to be drawn here, because it’s important not to write too much. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24981">David Twohy </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24982">(The Fugitive, Waterworld, Terminal Velocity)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24983"> says that “if it gets too detailed, then you’re doing the director’s job and you’re taking things away from him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24984">And he won’t appreciate that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24985">It’s best to give the maximum effect with the minimum amount of words.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24986">That means finding the right visual components to describe the sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24987">David Koepp, who wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24988">Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24989">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24990">The Lost World</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24991">, to name a few, says that the key to writing a good action sequence “is finding more ways to say that someone runs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24992">You tend to use a lot of adjectives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24993">For example: He runs to hide behind the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24994">He races over to the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24995">He scrambles over to the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24996">He crawls frantically on his belly over to the rock….Those are the things that drive me crazy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24997">Hurries, trots, sprints, dives, leaps, jumps, barrels, slams. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24998">The word </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24999">slams</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25000">, that’ll appear a lot in your action script.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25001">“In an action scene,” Koepp continues, “the reader is sometimes forcing their eyes along because what’s tremendously entertaining to watch on film is not necessarily so thrilling to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25002">I think the challenge is to make that stuff fly by at the pace you would like it to fly by in the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25003">So you’ve constantly got to find ways to make the action sequences readable and easy for the reader to picture in his mind.”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25004">What’s the best way to write an action sequence?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25005">Design it, choreograph the action from the beginning, through the middle, and to the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25006">Choose your words carefully when you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25007">Action is not written on the page with a lot of long and beautifully styled sentences, the way Tom Clancy does in his novels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25008">Though Clancy builds his cross-cutting scenes with rapid style movements, his intention is to hook his readers so they will move from scene to scene quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25009">It’s a very cinematic style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25010">Writing an action sequence has got to be more intense, more visual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25011">As Bill Wisher says, the reader must see the action as if he or she were seeing it on the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25012">We’re dealing with moving images that hopefully keep you glued to the edge of your seat, filled with excitement, or fear, or great expectation, locked in that great “community of emotion” that unites everybody in the darkened movie theater. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25013">Just look at the great action sequences: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25014">Bullitt, The French Connection, Psycho, Terminator 2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25015">, the long walk and final shootout from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25016">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25017">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25018">These are all action sequences that have been designed and choreographed with immense care and strict attention to detail.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25019">Sometimes people tend to write too little, and then the action line becomes thin and doesn’t carry the gripping intensity that you must have in a good action sequence.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25020">Suppose, for example, your screenplay is slow, it drags and sags, and seems dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25021">If you reexamine the material, it may be possible to insert some kind of action into the narrative that pumps up the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25022">But you must be careful that the action you want to insert belongs in the tone and style of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25023">Often the easy way out, a car chase, or a kiss, or a shootout, or a murder attempt, draws attention to itself and therefore will not work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25024">And there will be times when the problem will not be in the action, but in how the action is conceived and written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25025">We’ve become so sophisticated, in terms of reading screenplays, that the reader wants some kind of “involvement,” so you want to include the reader in such a way that he or she will be drawn into the action.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25142">It’s just good writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25143">Sometimes writers will try to cover a weakness in character writing by inserting action sequences, thus avoiding any attempt at characterization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25144">Sometimes the action sequences are written up in such detail that it looks like there’s a blanket of words on the page, and any attempt to create a good reading experience is simply lost in the excess verbiage.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25145">Writing a good action film, or a good action sequence, can often create as many problems as it solves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25146">But if you find that your script drags and sags, and needs an extra shot of something, consider some kind of action sequence that can be incorporated into the story line to visually expand the attributes of your character.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25147">Action and character, joined together, can often sharpen the focus of your screenplay and make it a better reading experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25148">And that’s what it’s all about.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25196">Endings have always fueled the industry dream factory; is there anyone who hasn’t heard about the problems of ending </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25197">Casablanca</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25198"> (Jules and Philip Stein) or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25199">Fatal Attraction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25200"> (James Deardon)? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25201">And what about the endings of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25202">White Palace</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25203"> (Alvin Sargent) or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25204">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25205"> (Ted Tally) or any of the myriad of other films released each year? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25206">Stories abound about endings that did not work, or the trials and tribulations of screenwriters and filmmakers trying to achieve the “right” ending.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25207">What’s so interesting about endings is that, most of the time, the ending is not really the problem, it’s the fact that it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25208">doesn’t work effectively</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25209">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25210">It’s either too soft, or too slow, too wordy or too vague, too expensive or not expensive enough, too down, too up, too contrived, too predictable, or too unbelievable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25211">Sometimes it’s simply not dramatic enough to resolve the story line, or maybe a surprise twist in the story line comes out of nowhere, with no relationship to the story or characters; it just creates a solution to the script, is an easy way to end the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25212">This happens a lot with young film students; the easiest way to end the screenplay is by having the main character die, or having everybody die.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25213">So many times we hear stories about film endings having been changed after audience previews. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25214">In many cases the ending of a screenplay is agreed upon, then changed, or sometimes two or three endings will be shot during production, and then a decision will be made in the cutting room, or after audience previews, about which one to use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25215">It happens all the time, and because of the high financial risk factors that go along with making movies, the filmmakers and studios have learned to take their cues from the preview audience, so changing the ending has become part of the moviemaking process.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25216">Strong endings are an essential part of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25217">Whether it’s a drama, comedy, or action thriller, or whatever, doesn’t really matter; what’s important is that the ending be a dynamic conclusion to the story line.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25288">At that point we cut to present time, where Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) tells the English patient he had intended to kill him, but the dying man replies that he can’t, because he’s “already dead.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25289">At this point his life is over, and Hana (Juliette Binoche) fulfills his wish and gives him an overdose of morphine, so he’s able to leave his body and join his true love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25290">Day breaks, and we follow Hana as she climbs aboard a truck, to begin a new life as a new person, the ghosts of her past buried, and as the truck pulls away, she begins her journey into the light of a new day.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25304">First, set up what you have to pay off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25305">Determine what elements of the story must be resolved at the end of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25306">If need be, write an essay about what happens in Act III so the story line can be resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25307">Then you might want to go through the action and, in free association, in a page-or-two essay, begin to list the ways this film can end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25308">Don’t be attached to any one single shot, scene, or sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25309">Just list the various ways the ending can be achieved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25310">If that doesn’t clarify the action, and you’re still unclear about how the material should end, simply write down how you would like it to end, regardless of budget, believability, or anything else that gets in the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25311">Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas, without any regard as to how to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25312">That’s really the first step in the completion process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25313">It’s important to tie together all the loose ends of the narrative line so the screenplay becomes a complete reading experience that rings true and is integral to the action and the characters.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25348">The ending is something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25349">There is a little tag added on after the action is complete; a naval inquiry is held, and it is decided that both men were right in their actions, because the naval regulations happen to be unclear in this particular situation and must be changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25350">The Gene Hackman character retires from active duty, the Denzel Washington character will be promoted to captain and receive command of his own ship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25351">When the two men walk outside, the Denzel Washington character tells Gene Hackman that the Lipizzaner horses are really from Spain, not from Portugal, as the Hackman character had claimed, and they’re born black at birth and as they grow into adulthood, they turn white. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25352">And, that’s the final comment on the film; the conflict between them was not really a question of right versus wrong, but a question of right versus right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25353">Which is what the entire screenplay is all about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25354">The Lipizzaner is of mixed Arabian, Italian, and Spanish ancestry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25355">The breed was founded in Trieste. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25356">Lipizzaner show horses are trained at the Spanish Riding School in Vienna.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25359">A good ending is only as strong as Act I; in other words, a good ending is set up from the very beginning of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25360">It will always come out of the integrity of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25361">In many scripts the ending seems predictable; that is, we know what’s going to happen, we just don’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25362">how. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25363">Jerry Maguire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25364"> (Cameron Crowe) is a script like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25365">We know from the very beginning what’s going to happen, and the two people are going to get together, but the fun comes in watching how it happens.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25366">Of course, there are other ways to approach an ending in relationship stories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25367">One of my favorite examples is Michelangelo Antonioni’s classic </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25368">L’Eclisse (The Eclipse)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25369">, with Alain Delon and Monica Vitti. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25370">In the opening shot two people are sitting silently in a room. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25371">The only sound we hear is the whirring of a small fan as it swings back and forth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25372">For almost four minutes nothing is said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25373">That’s because there is nothing left to say, it’s all been said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25374">The curtains are drawn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25375">The silence is loud except for the fan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25376">And we know, by the words not spoken, that the relationship, whatever it might have been, is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25377">The woman suddenly turns and draws back the curtains, letting in the light of a new day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25378">“Well,” she says, “I’ve got to go.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25379">The man, obviously exhausted, jumps up and says, “Let me drive you.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25380">“No, no…” she replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25381">He insists. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25382">She walks out and he follows her; “Please,” he begs, “let’s have dinner tonight…let’s talk it over.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25383">She doesn’t reply but strides forward with purpose and determination.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25384">That’s the opening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25385">It’s wonderful, because even though nothing has been said, we understand immediately what has happened; the relationship is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25386">Film is behavior.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25387">The Monica Vitti character goes back into her life, and meets Alain Delon, a very attractive and successful stockbroker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25388">They like each other, and begin seeing each other, and as they get closer and spend more time with each other, we like them; they’re attractive, they have many things in common, and we “hope” they can stay together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25389">But as the film progresses, we begin to see things that separate them; he lies to his clients, which she can’t stand, and sometimes he’ll do something dishonest, and then try to justify it to her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25390">She believes in being totally honest, living with integrity, and while we notice her reaction to this part of his personality, nothing is really said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25391">We only see it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25392">The end of the film is incredible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25393">There are two scenes very close together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25394">First, they are in his apartment, and he asks if she thinks “we can get along together.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25395">She considers this, hesitating. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25396">“I don’t know,” she replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25397">“There you go again,” he says, “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know….Why do you see me, then?…And don’t tell me you don’t know.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25398">She pauses for a long moment and says, “I wish I didn’t love you…Or that I loved you much more.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25399">He looks at her, not understanding.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25400">Then, in a continuation of the first scene, we cut to his office, late afternoon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25401">The phones are off the hook. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25402">They embrace after they’ve made passionate love, and talk of this and that, when suddenly, the doorbell rings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25403">He freezes, telling her to be silent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25404">He puts on his jacket, as she prepares to leave. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25405">He puts the phones back on the hook, and one by one they start ringing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25406">It’s time to go back to work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25407">“See you tomorrow?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25408">he asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25409">She nods yes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25410">“And the day after, and the day after that…” he says playfully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25411">“And, tonight…” she replies, smiling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25412">“Eight o’clock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25413">Same place,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25414">And they continue to look at each other, the phones ringing incessantly; they embrace passionately, then she turns and walks down the stairs and we follow her outside.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25415">There follow seven minutes of the most incredibly striking sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25416">The two characters we’ve followed for almost the entire film are nowhere to be seen during it, only the places they’ve been together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25417">Shot after shot after shot fill the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25418">We see someone who looks like her from behind, but it is not her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25419">We see someone walk out of his building, but it’s not him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25420">Places and faces and objects are focused on, and at the end a bright streetlight fills the frame. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25421">The film ends, wrapped in discordant music.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25422">It’s breathtaking, perhaps the greatest ending I’ve ever seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25423">We continually expect to see the couple again, and only at the very end do we realize that their relationship was not strong enough for them to stay together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25424">It’s a visually haunting and demanding sequence and derives its power from the opening scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25425">Both relationships, at the beginning and at the end, have failed to bear fruit for her, and we’re left wondering what it was that she wanted in a relationship and whether it was realistic or idealistic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25426">We’ll never know, for the landscape of love and relationship is always challenging.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25427">In one way this is an ambiguous ending, and yet it has been totally paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25428">We know that she’s a person searching for love, and we understand that she never found it, but because we don’t see the actual ending of the relationship, it lets us make our own decisions as to what really happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25429">As an ending it works effectively, even though our expectations, however unrealistic, would like to have a more romantic resolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25430">But the power of that ending is like an eclipse: extraordinary.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25431">So what makes a good ending? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25432">It has to work, first of all, by satisfying the story; so when we reach the final fadeout, or walk out of the movie experience, we want to feel full and satisfied, much as if we were leaving the table after a good meal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25433">It’s this feeling of satisfaction that must be fulfilled in order for the ending to work effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25434">And of course, it’s got to be believable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25435">An unsatisfying ending occurred in the thriller </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25436">Jagged Edge</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25437"> (Joe Eszterhas). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25438">The story, about a woman attorney called out of retirement to represent a wealthy publisher accused of murdering his wife (the script opens with the murder), totally believes he is innocent and despite herself falls in love with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25439">She convinces the jury that he’s innocent and gets him an acquittal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25440">Only then does she begin to suspect that he really is guilty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25441">When she investigates her suspicions, she searches a closet and there finds the critical piece of incriminating evidence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25442">Uh-oh. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25443">Too pat, too contrived, too forced, too simple, totally unsatisfying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25444">Doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25445">The same is true of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25446">Presumed Innocent</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25447">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25448">Taken from Scott Turow’s best seller, and adapted by Frank Pierson and Alan Pakula (who also directed), a well-known prosecutor is assigned to investigate the murder of an attractive assistant prosecutor with whom he’d had an affair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25449">As the evidence piles up, he is charged with the murder, manages to get acquitted, and guess what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25450">Trite and unconvincing.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25451">If you contrast this with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25452">Deceiver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25453"> (the Pate brothers), Tim Roth portrays a wealthy liar suspected of killing a hooker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25454">Two detectives believe he is guilty, but when he takes the lie detector test, he literally defeats the machine; the two cops know he’s guilty but can’t prove it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25455">After he suddenly, and mysteriously, “dies,” the case is closed; and then, in the last shot, we see Tim Roth approaching another woman, and we know, with chilling certainty, that he has staged his own death in order to beat the rap. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25456">This particular ending is more satisfying than the endings of the other two films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25457">It’s a new twist on an old theme.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25458">In order for an ending to truly work, it has to satisfy the requirement of believability. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25459">Absolute Power</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25460"> (William Goldman) is slick and well done, and Clint Eastwood’s direction is marvelous. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25461">The story moves along with tense sophistication and ease. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25462">Now, this is a case, at least for me, where I admired the film even though it did not engage the “willing suspension of disbelief.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25463">Not for one instant did I believe that the President of the United States, with only three people in the Secret Service, could bring this all about: The opening sequence, the inciting incident, shows a man and woman, drunk, staggering into the bedroom of a large mansion, just as a burglar is cleaning out the vault. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25464">The thief can only watch as the sexual encounter turns violent and the woman, defending herself from the man, picks up the letter opener and prepares to stab him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25465">The door bursts open and two Secret Service agents appear and kill the woman.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25466">When the chief of staff and the two agents discover that the Clint Eastwood character, the burglar, has seen the whole thing, they go after him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25467">Naturally, they find out who he is, but, of course, they must break all laws to kill him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25468">In this case I don’t buy it at all, but what’s so interesting to me is the relationship between the father (Eastwood) and his estranged daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25469">This relationship is a significant part of the film, and when the President orders the Secret Service agents to kill Eastwood’s daughter, Plot Point II, the master thief gets really pissed and decides to take on the President. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25470">And, in the end, justice is served, and father and daughter are reconciled.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25471">So, even though I did not “willingly suspend my disbelief,” I bought the ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25472">It was a fulfilling and satisfying experience.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25473">What you want to accomplish is the “best” possible ending that works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25474">You want to be true to your story line, and not have to resort to any tricks, gimmicks, or contrived elements, in order to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25475">What’s the best way to do this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25476">First, and I think this goes without saying, you have to be clear on what kind of film you’re writing; then you can begin to devise and execute an appropriate ending.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25477">So, how would you like it to end? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25478">What is the resolution? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25479">Then, what do you have to do to achieve it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25480">If the ending doesn’t work the way it is, or how you think it should, feel free to go back and play with it a little. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25481">Think about the ending in terms of the reader or viewer’s satisfaction, because the key to a successful ending is the feeling of satisfaction or fulfillment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25482">Whether it’s happy or sad makes no difference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25483">Is the story line resolved? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25484">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25485">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25486">, the ending and the beginning are the same.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25487">If I could sum up the concept of endings, and declare what is the one most important thing to remember, I would say that the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25488">ending comes out of the beginning</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25489">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25490">Someone, or something, initiates an action, and how that action is resolved becomes the story line of the film.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25491">So, whatever problem you might have, whether it’s one of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25492">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25493">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25494">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25495">, know that if you created the problem, then you can solve it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25496">Don’t be afraid to rethink the material, don’t be afraid to rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25497">Anthony Minghella </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25498">(The English Patient)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25499"> told me he did twenty-one rewrites on the material, and he was still rewriting in the editing room while they were cutting the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25500">It’s not how many times you need to rewrite the material, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25501">it’s what you need to do in order to make the material the best it can be</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25502">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25503">That means being able to recognize, define, and then solve whatever problem you might have.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25504">If there’s one quality I feel is the most essential within the cauldron of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25505">Problem Solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25506">, it’s patience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25507">If you become impatient with the material, impatient with yourself, impatient with a lack of progress, impatient with how many times you have to rewrite the same material, impatient with the results, just put your impatience aside and keep to the task at hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25508">Your job, your responsibility, is to make the material the best it can be, regardless of how long it takes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25509">I know people who write their first draft, dabble a little on some scenes, then send it out into the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25510">It’s not ready, and it comes back with the results that you would expect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25511">Nobody’s interested, everyone has an idea on how to make it better, and you hit the wall of rejection that is so debilitating it’s possible you’ll put the script on the shelf somewhere and never go back to it.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25512">There’s another side to this coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25513">The more people you give your script to read, the more diverse and contradictory the opinions will be about what you have to add, change, or delete in a rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25514">So many times writers give their material to people to read and the opinions and criticisms they receive are so diverse, so contradictory, and alter the story line so much, they don’t even recognize the material anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25515">That’s because it’s not their story anymore.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25516">That happens all the time in the studio system of making movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25517">The cost of making studio movies has become so exorbitant, costing almost $12,000 to $15,000 per minute, and that, coupled with the cost of prints and advertising and distribution rising at an almost fifteen-percent increase every year, makes the studios hedge their bets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25518">So they appeal to the lowest common denominator; the higher the budget, the more people become involved in adding things to the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25519">It doesn’t matter whether it’s “right” or not, or whether it “works” or not, studio executives and producers give their input all the time, and their opinions and suggestions are not always right for the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25520">But because of the money at stake, the ideas are accepted and written into the shooting script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25521">Most of the time the results are a disaster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25522">Look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25523">Waterworld</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25524">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25525">Judge Dredd</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25526">, as two such examples.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25527">The same happens in writing classes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25528">Everyone in the class is invited to give their opinion about what the writer should do to make the script better, and since everyone has their own opinion, you have a tendency to think that “maybe they’re right,” and you’re “wrong,” because you’re so close to the material you can’t see it anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25529">If you think that, if you really buy into that, you’ll very soon succumb to the haze of confusion and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25530">If you follow everybody’s suggestions, just to follow the suggestions, you’ll find it’s no longer your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25531">At that point it doesn’t belong to anybody; the changes will be so far removed from what your original intention was that it’s neither your screenplay nor theirs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25532">If their suggestions feel right and you think they’re accurate, use them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25533">But if you know they’re wrong, and what they suggest won’t work for your story, don’t use them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25534">Whatever works, works, and whatever doesn’t, doesn’t, it’s really that simple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25535">At least in theory.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25536">If you make changes that you don’t feel are right for your screenplay, that’s when it can become a real problem, indeed a nightmare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25537">It never works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25538">The only thing that works, in terms of your material, is whether you feel satisfied with it when you put it out into the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25539">Deep down inside, when you’re “one on one,” you have to know that you’ve done the best job you can do, at least at this time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25540">Only you can know that with certainty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25541">Only you can trust your own instincts, your own creative Self.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25542">As I’ve said many times over, everybody’s a writer; everybody has an opinion about how to make your script better, how to sharpen the characters, how to make it more “commercial,” how to be more acceptable to the current temper or trend of the times.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25543">There will be occasions when someone will make a particular comment or observation that strikes a chord, or a feeling, within you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25544">That’s what you’re looking for, that’s what you have to follow as you walk along the path of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25545">Problem Solving;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25546"> that’s the only map you can follow, that’s the spark of truth and light that illuminates your own creative vision.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25547">Are you willing to do what has to be done to make your screenplay the best it can be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25548">Are you willing to be true to your own vision? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25549">Are you willing to sit down and honor your own inner voice, and mine whatever problems the material might have and turn them into a workable solution? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25550">A solution that becomes an opportunity for your own growth and expansion, a solution, whether you know it or not, that will only sharpen your skills as a screenwriter?</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25551">Problem solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25552"> is really two sides of the same coin, a process that contains both sacrifice and commitment, for it’s either a challenge or an obligation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25553">Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it or you don’t. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25554">“The World is as you see it,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25555"> reads the ancient scripture. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25556">Either you see it as an opportunity, or a burden. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25557">Either you honor your own creative vision, or you don’t.</span></p>
