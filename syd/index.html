		<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-248">In 1979, when I first wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-249">Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-250">, there were only a few books on the market that dealt with the art and craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-251">The most popular was Lagos Egri’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-252">The Art of Dramatic Writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-253">, first published in the 1940s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-254">Though it was not really a book about screenwriting, but playwriting, the principles laid out were precise and clear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-255">At that time, there was no real distinction made between the crafts of writing for the stage and writing for the screen.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-256">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-257"> changed all that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-258">It laid out the principles of dramatic structure to establish the foundations of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-259">It was also the first book to use well-known and popular movies of the time to illustrate the craft of writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-260">And, as we all know, screenwriting is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-261">When it was first published, it became an immediate best seller, or “an instant sensation,” as my publisher labeled it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-262">Within the first few months of publication it went through several printings and became a “hot” topic of discussion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-263">Everyone, it seemed, was surprised by its meteoric success.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-264">Except me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-265">During my teaching and lecturing on screenwriting in the 1970s at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood, I saw people from all walks of life burning with an incredible desire to write screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-266">Hundreds of people flowed thorough my course on screenwriting, and it soon became clear that everyone had a story to tell. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-267">They just didn’t know how to tell it.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-268">Since that day in the early spring of 1979 when </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-269">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-270"> first arrived on bookstore shelves, there has been a tremendous upsurge in the evolution of writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-271">Today, the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking is an integral part of our culture and cannot be ignored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-272">Walk into any bookstore and you’ll see shelves and shelves devoted to all aspects of filmmaking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-273">In fact, the two most popular majors on college campuses are business and film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-274">And with the dramatic rise of computer technology and computer graphic imagery, the expanded influence of MTV, reality TV, Xbox, PlayStation, and new wireless LAN technology, and the enormous increase in film festivals both here and abroad, we’re in the middle of a cinematic revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-275">It won’t be too long before we make a short film on our telephones, e-mail them to our friends, and project them on our TV. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-276">Clearly, we have evolved in the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-277">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-278"> things.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-279">Take a look at the epic adventure </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-280">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-281"> (all three parts), or the portrait of the modern family illustrated in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-282">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-283">, or the emotional and visual impact of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-284">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-285">, or the literary presentations of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-286">The Bourne Supremacy, Cold Mountain, Memento, Rushmore, Magnolia, The Royal Tenenbaums</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-287">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-288">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-289">, compare them to any films of the ’70s or ’80s, and you’ll see the distinctions of this revolution: the images are fast; the information conveyed is visual, rapid; the use of silence is exaggerated; and the special effects and music are heightened and more pronounced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-290">The concept of time is often more subjective and nonlinear, more novelistic in tone and execution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-291">Yet, while the tools and technique of storytelling have evolved and progressed based on the needs and technologies of the time, the art of storytelling has remained the same.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-292">Movies are a combination of art and science; the technological revolution has literally changed the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-293">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-294"> movies and therefore, by necessity, has changed the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-295">write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-296"> movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-297">But no matter what changes are made in the execution of the material, the nature of the screenplay is the same as it has always been: A screenplay is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-298">a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-299">placed within the context of dramatic structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-300">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-301">That’s what it is; that is its nature. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-302">It is the art of visual storytelling.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-303">The craft of screenwriting is a creative process that can be learned. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-304">To tell a story, you have to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-305">set up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-306"> your characters, introduce the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-307">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-308"> (what the story is about) and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-309">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-310"> (the circumstances surrounding the action), create obstacles for your characters to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-311">confront</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-312"> and overcome, then </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-313">resolve</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-314"> the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-315">You know, boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-316">All stories, from Aristotle through all the constellations of civilization, embody the same dramatic principles.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-317">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-318">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-319">, Frodo becomes the ring bearer to return the ring to its place of origin, Mount Doom, so he can destroy it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-320">That is his dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-321">How he gets there and completes the task is the story. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-322">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-323"> sets up the characters and situation and narrative through line; it establishes Frodo and the Shire, as well as the Fellowship, who set off on their mission to Mount Doom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-324">Part II, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-325">The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-326">, dramatizes the obstacles Frodo, Sam, and the Fellowship confront on their journey to destroy the ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-327">They are confronted with obstacle after obstacle that hinder their mission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-328">At the same time, Aragorn and the others must overcome many challenges to defeat the Orcs at Helms Deep. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-329">And Part III, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-330">The Return of the King</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-331">, resolves the story: Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom and watch as the ring and the Gollum fall into the fires and are destroyed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-332">Aragorn is crowned king, and the hobbits return to the Shire and their life plays out.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-333">Set-up, confrontation, and resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-334">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-335">It is the stuff of drama. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-336">I learned this when I was a kid sitting in a darkened theater, popcorn in hand, gazing in awe and wonder at the images projected on the white river of light reflected on that monster screen.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-337">A native of Los Angeles (my grandfather arrived here from Poland in 1907), I grew up surrounded by the film industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-338">When I was about ten, as a member of the Sheriff’s Boys’ Band, I was cast in Frank Capra’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-339">The State of the Union</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-340">, starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-341">I don’t remember much about the experience except that Van Johnson taught me how to play checkers.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-342">On Saturday afternoons, my friends and I used to sneak into the neighborhood theater and watch the serials of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-343">Flash Gordon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-344"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-345">Buck Rogers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-346">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-347">During my teens, going to the movies became a passion, a form of entertainment, a distraction, and a topic of discussion, as well as a place to make out and have fun. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-348">Occasionally, there would be unforgettable moments—like watching Bogart and Bacall in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-349">To Have and Have Not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-350">, or Walter Huston’s mad dance as he discovered gold in the mountains in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-351">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-352">, or watching Brando stagger up the gangplank at the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-353">On the Waterfront</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-354">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-355">I attended Hollywood High School and was invited to join the Athenians, one of the many clubs whose members hung out together during high school. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-356">A short time after graduation, one of my best friends, Frank Mazzola, also a member of the Athenians, met James Dean and formed a strong relationship with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-357">Frank introduced Dean to what a high school “club” was like during this period (by today’s standards it would probably be referred to as a gang). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-358">Director Nicholas Ray and James Dean chose Frank to be the “gang” consultant in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-359">Rebel Without a Cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-360"> and to play the part of Crunch in the movie, so the Athenians became the model of the club/gang in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-361">Rebel Without a Cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-362">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-363">Occasionally Dean would come with us when we strolled down Hollywood Boulevard on a Saturday night looking for trouble. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-364">We were the so-called tough kids, never backing down from anything, whether it was a dare or a fight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-365">We managed to get into a lot of trouble.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-366">Dean loved hearing about our “adventures” and would continually pump us for details. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-367">When we pulled some wild stunt, whatever it was, he wanted to know how it started, what we were thinking, how it felt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-368">Actors’ questions.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-369">It was only after </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-370">Rebel Without a Cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-371"> was released and stormed the world that I became aware of how significant our contribution to the movie had been. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-372">The irony of Dean’s having hung out with us during that period had no real effect on me until after he died; only then, when he became an icon of our generation, did I begin to grasp the significance of what we had contributed.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-373">It was Mazzola who convinced me to take an acting class, which ultimately transformed my life; it was one of those moments that impact a series of other moments and led me to the path I’m still following to this day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-374">My family—aunts and uncles (my parents had died several years earlier)—wanted me to be a “professional person,” meaning a doctor, lawyer, or dentist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-375">I had been working part-time at Mount Sinai Hospital and I liked the drama and pace of emergency room medicine, so I entertained thoughts about becoming a doctor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-376">I enrolled at the University of California, packed up the few belongings I had, and drove to Berkeley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-377">It was August 1959.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-378">Berkeley at the dawn of the ’60s was an active crucible of revolt and unrest; banners, slogans, and leaflets were everywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-379">Castro’s rebel force had just overthrown Batista, and signs were everywhere, ranging from “Cuba Libre” and “Time for the Revolution” to “Free Speech,” “Abolish ROTC,” “Equal Rights for Everyone,” and “Socialism for All, &amp; All for Socialism.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-380">Telegraph Avenue, the main street leading onto campus, was always lined with a colorful display of banners and leaflets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-381">Protest rallies were held almost every day, and when I’d stop to listen, FBI agents, trying to be inconspicuous in their shirts and ties, would be taking pictures of everyone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-382">It was a joke.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-383">It didn’t take long for me to be swept up in the activities personifying the fervid issues of the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-384">Like so many others of my generation, I was influenced and inspired by the “beats”—Kerouac, Ginsberg, Gregory Corso: the poet/saints who were blazing a trail of rebellion and revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-385">Inspired by their voices and their lives, I, too, wanted to ride the waves of change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-386">It wasn’t too long before the campus exploded into a political frenzy initiated by Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-387">It was during my second semester at Berkeley that I auditioned for, and was cast as, Woyzeck in the German Expressionist drama </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-388">Woyzeck</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-389">, by Georg Büchner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-390">It was while I was performing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-391">Woyzeck</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-392"> that I met the great French film director Jean Renoir.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-393">My relationship with Renoir literally changed my life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-394">I’ve learned there are two or three times during a lifetime when something happens that alters the course of that life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-395">We meet someone, go somewhere, or do something we’ve never done before, and those moments are the possibilities that guide us to where we’re supposed to go and what we’re supposed to do with our lives.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-396">People say I was extremely fortunate to be working with Renoir, that it was a chance and fortuitous accident of being in the right place at the right time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-397">That’s true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-398">But over the years, I’ve learned not to believe too much in luck or accidents; I think everything happens for a reason. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-399">There’s something to be learned from every moment, every experience we encounter during the brief time we spend on this planet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-400">Call it fate, call it destiny, call it what you will; it really doesn’t matter.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-401">I auditioned for the world premiere of Renoir’s play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-402">Carola</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-403">, and was cast in the third lead, playing the part of Campan, the stage manager of a theater in Paris during the Nazi occupation in the last days of World War II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-404">For almost a year, I sat at Renoir’s feet, watching and learning about movies through his eyes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-405">He was always commenting on film, his opinions vocal and fervent about everything he saw or wrote, either as an artist, a person, or a humanitarian. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-406">And he was all of these. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-407">Being in his presence was an inspiration, a major life lesson, a joy, a privilege, as well as a great learning experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-408">Though movies had always been a major part of my life, it was only during the time I spent with Renoir that I turned my focus to film, the same way a plant turns toward the sun. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-409">Suddenly, I saw movies in a whole new light, as an art form to study and learn, seeking in the story and images an expression and understanding of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-410">My love for the movies has fed and nourished me ever since.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-411">“Qu’est-ce que le cinéma?”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-412"> is the question Renoir always used to ask before he showed us one of his films. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-413">“What is film?”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-414"> He used to say movies are more than mere flashing images on the screen: “They are an art form that becomes larger than life.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-415">What can I say about Jean Renoir? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-416">He was a man like any other, but what separated him, at least in my mind, was his great heart; he was open, friendly, a man of great intelligence, wisdom, and wit who seemed to influence the lives of everyone he touched. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-417">The son of the great Impressionistic painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean, too, had the great gift of sight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-418">Renoir taught me about film, mentored me in the art of visually telling a story, and imparted the gift of insight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-419">He showed me the door, then held it open as I walked through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-420">I’ve never looked back.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-421">Renoir hated the cliché. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-422">He would quote his father about bringing an idea into existence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-423">“If you paint the leaf on a tree without using a model,” Renoir told us the great Impressionistic painter once said, “your imagination will only supply you with a few leaves; but Nature offers you millions, all on the same tree. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-424">No two leaves are exactly the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-425">The artist who paints only what is in his mind must very soon repeat himself.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-426">If you look at Renoir’s great paintings, you’ll see what he meant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-427">No two leaves, no two flowers, no two people are ever painted in the same way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-428">It’s the same with his son’s films: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-429">Grand Illusion, Rules of the Game</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-430"> (considered two of the greatest films ever made), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-431">The Golden Coach, Picnic on the Grass</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-432">, and many more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-433">Renoir told me he “painted with light,” the same way his father painted with oils. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-434">Jean Renoir was an artist who discovered the cinema in the same way his father “discovered” Impressionism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-435">“Art,” he said, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator.”</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-451">For the past few decades, as I’ve traveled and lectured around the world on the art and craft of screenwriting, I have watched the style of screenwriting evolve into a more visual medium. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-452">As I mentioned, we’re seeing certain techniques of the novel, like stream of consciousness and chapter headings, beginning to seep into the modern screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-453">(</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-454">Kill Bill I</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-455"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-456">II, The Hours, The Royal Tenenbaums, American Beauty, The Bourne Supremacy, The Manchurian Candidate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-457">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-458">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-459"> are just a few examples.) It’s clear that a whole new computer-savvy generation, who grew up with interactive software, digital storytelling, and editing applications sees things in a more visual way and is thus able to express it in a more cinematic style.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-460">But when all is said and done, the principles of screenwriting don’t change; they are the same no matter in what time or place or era we live. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-461">Great films are timeless—they embody and capture the times in which they were made; the human condition is the same now as it was then.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-462">My purpose in writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-463">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-464"> was to explore the craft of screenwriting and illustrate the foundations of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-465">When you want to write a screenplay, there are two aspects you have to deal with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-466">One is the preparation required to write it: the research, thinking time, character work, and laying out of the structural dynamic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-467">The other is the execution, the actual writing of it, laying out the visual images and capturing the dialogue. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-468">The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-469">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-470">That was true when I first wrote the book, and it is now.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-471">This is not a “how-to” book; I can’t teach anybody </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-472">how to write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-473"> a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-474">People teach themselves the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-475">All I can do is show them </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-476">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-477"> they have to do to write a successful screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-478">So, I call this a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-479">what-to</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-480"> book, meaning if you have an idea for a screenplay, and you don’t know what to do or how to do it, I can show you.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-481">As a writer-producer for David L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-482">Wolper Productions, a freelance screenwriter, and head of the story department at Cinemobile Systems, I have spent years writing and reading screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-483">At Cinemobile alone, I read and synopsized more than two thousand screenplays in a little over two years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-484">And of all those two thousand screenplays, I only found forty to submit to our financial partners for possible film production.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-485">Why so few? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-486">Because ninety-nine out of a hundred screenplays I read weren’t good enough to invest millions of dollars in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-487">Put another way, only one out of a hundred screenplays I read was good enough to consider for film production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-488">And at Cinemobile, our job was making movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-489">In one year alone, we were directly involved in the production of some 119 motion pictures, ranging from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-490">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-491"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-492">Jeremiah Johnson</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-493"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-494">Deliverance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-495"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-496">Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-497"> to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-498">American Graffiti</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-499">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-500">At that time, in the early ’70s, Cinemobile was a portable location facility that literally revolutionized film production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-501">Filmmakers no longer had to rely on a supply caravan to carry cast, crew, and equipment to whatever location they were using. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-502">Basically, the Cinemobile was a Greyhound bus with an eight-wheel-drive, so we could store equipment in the luggage area, then transport cast and crew to the top of a mountain, shoot three to eight pages of script each day, and return home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-503">My boss, Fouad Said, the creator of the Cinemobile, became so successful that he decided to make his own movies, so he went out and raised several million dollars in a few weeks, with a revolving fund of many million more, if needed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-504">Pretty soon everybody in Hollywood was sending him screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-505">Thousands of scripts came in, from stars and directors, from studios and producers, from the known and the unknown.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-506">That’s when I was given the opportunity to read the submitted screenplays and evaluate them in terms of cost, quality, and probable budget. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-507">My job, as I was constantly reminded, was to “find material” for our three financial partners: the United Artists Theatre Group; the Hemdale Film Distribution Company, headquartered in London; and the Taft Broadcasting Company, parent company of Cinemobile.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-508">So I began reading screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-509">As a screenwriter taking a much-needed break from more than seven years of freelance writing (I had written nine screenplays: two were produced, four were optioned, and three nothing ever happened with), my job at Cinemobile gave me a totally new perspective on writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-510">It was a tremendous opportunity, a formidable challenge, and a dynamic learning experience.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-511">I kept asking myself what made the screenplays I recommended better than the others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-512">At first I didn’t have any answers, but I held it in my consciousness and thought about it a long time.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-513">Every morning, when I arrived at work, there would be a stack of screenplays on my desk, waiting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-514">No matter what I did, no matter how fast I read or how many scripts I skimmed, skipped, or tossed, one solid fact always remained: The size of the pile never changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-515">I knew I could never get through the pile.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-516">Reading a screenplay is a unique experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-517">It’s not like reading a novel, play, or article in the Sunday paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-518">When I first started reading, I read the words on the page slowly, drinking in all the visual descriptions, character nuances, and dramatic situations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-519">But that didn’t work for me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-520">I found it too easy to get caught up in the writer’s words and style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-521">I learned that most of the scripts that read well—meaning they featured lovely sentences, stylish and literate prose, and beautiful dialogue—usually didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-522">While they might read like liquid honey flowing across the page, the overall feeling was that of reading a short story or a strong journalistic piece in a magazine like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-523">Vanity Fair</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-524"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-525">Esquire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-526">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-527">But that’s not what makes a good screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-528">I started out wanting to read and “do coverage” on—synopsize—three screenplays a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-529">I found I could read two scripts without a problem, but when I got to the third, the words, characters, and actions all seemed to congeal into some kind of amorphous goo of plotlines concerning the FBI and CIA, punctuated with bank heists, murders, and car chases, with a lot of wet kisses and naked flesh thrown in for local color. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-530">At two or three in the afternoon, after a heavy lunch and maybe a little too much wine, it was difficult to keep my attention focused on the action or nuances of character and story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-531">So, after a few months on the job, I usually found myself closing my office door, propping my feet up on the desk, turning off the phones, leaning back in the chair with a script on my chest, and taking a catnap.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-532">I must have read more than a hundred screenplays before I realized that I didn’t know what I was doing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-533">What was I looking for? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-534">What made a screenplay good or bad? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-535">I could tell whether I liked it or not, yes, but what were the elements that made it a good screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-536">It had to be more than a string of clever bits and smart dialogue laced together in a series of beautiful pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-537">Was it the plot, the characters, or the visual arena where the action took place that made it a good screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-538">Was it the visual style of writing or the cleverness of the dialogue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-539">If I didn’t know the answers to that, then how could I answer the question I was repeatedly being asked by agents, writers, producers, and directors: What was I looking for? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-540">That’s when I understood that the real question for me was, How do I read a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-541">I knew how to write a screenplay, and I certainly knew what I liked or disliked when I went to the movies, but how did I apply that to the reading of a screenplay?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-542">The more I thought about it, the clearer I became. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-543">What I was looking for, I soon realized, was a style that exploded off the page, exhibiting the kind of raw energy found in scripts like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-544">Chinatown, Taxi Driver, The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-545">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-546">American Graffiti</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-547">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-548">As the stack of scripts on my desk grew higher and higher, I felt very much like Jay Gatsby at the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-549">The Great Gatsby</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-550">, F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-551">Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-552">At the end of the book, Nick, the narrator, recalls how Gatsby used to stand looking out over the water at the image of the green light, beckoning him to past memories of unrequited love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-553">Gatsby was a man who believed in the past, a man who believed that if he had enough wealth and power, he could turn back time and re-create it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-554">It was that dream that spurred him as a young man to cross over the tracks, searching for love and wealth, searching for the expectations and desires of the past that he hoped would become the future.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-555">The green light.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-556">I thought a lot about Gatsby and the green light as I struggled through those piles of screenplays searching for “the good read,” that special and unique screenplay that would be “the one” to make it through the gauntlet of studios, executives, stars, financial wizards, and egos and finally end up on that monster screen in a darkened theater.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-557">It was just about that time that I was given the opportunity to teach a screenwriting class at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-558">At that time in the ’70s, Sherwood Oaks was a professional school taught by professionals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-559">It was the kind of school where Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, and Lucille Ball gave acting seminars; where Tony Bill taught a producing seminar; where Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, and Alan Pakula gave directing seminars; where John Alonzo and Vilmos Zsigmond, two of the finest cinematographers in the world, taught classes in cinematography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-560">It was a school where producers, professional production managers, cameramen, film editors, writers, directors, and script supervisors all came to teach their craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-561">It was the most unique film school in the country.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-562">I had never taught a screenwriting class before, so I had to delve into my own writing and reading experience to evolve my basic material.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-563">What is a good screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-564">I kept asking myself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-565">And pretty soon I started getting some answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-566">When you read a good screenplay, you know it—it’s evident from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-567">The style, the way the words are laid out on the page, the way the story is set up, the grasp of dramatic situation, the introduction of the main character, the basic premise or problem of the screenplay—it’s all set up in the first few pages of the script: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-568">Chinatown, Five Easy Pieces, The Godfather, The French Connection, Shampoo</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-569">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-570">All the President’s Men</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-571"> are all perfect examples.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-572">A screenplay, I soon realized, is a story told with pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-573">It’s like a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-574">noun;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-575"> it has a subject, and is usually about a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-576">person</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-577">, or persons, in a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-578">place</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-579">, or places, doing his, or her, or their </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-580">“thing.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-581"> The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-582">person</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-583"> is the main character and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-584">doing his/her thing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-585"> is the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-586">Out of that understanding, I saw that any good screenplay has certain conceptual components common to the screenplay form.</span></p>

		<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-668">In the summer of 1937, F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-669">Scott Fitzgerald, drinking far too much, deeply in debt, and drowning in the suffocating well of despair, moved to Hollywood seeking new beginnings, hoping to reinvent himself by writing for the movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-670">The author of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-671">The Great Gatsby, Tender Is the Night, This Side of Paradise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-672">, and the uncompleted </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-673">The Last Tycoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-674">, perhaps America’s greatest novelist, was, as one friend put it, seeking redemption.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-675">During the two and a half years he spent in Hollywood, he took the craft of screenwriting “very seriously,” says one noted Fitzgerald authority: “It’s heartbreaking to see how much effort he put into it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-676">Fitzgerald approached every screenplay as if it were a novel and often wrote long backstories for each of the main characters before putting one word of dialogue down on paper.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-677">Despite all the preparation he put into each assignment, he was obsessed with finding the answer to a question that haunted him continuously: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-678">What makes a good screenplay?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-679"> Billy Wilder once compared Fitzgerald to “a great sculptor who is hired to do a plumbing job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-680">He did not know how to connect the pipes so the water could flow.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-681">Throughout his Hollywood years, he was always trying to find the “balance” between the words spoken and the pictures seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-682">During this time, he received only one screen credit, adapting the novel </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-683">Three Comrades</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-684"> by Erich Maria Remarque (starring Robert Taylor and Margaret Sullavan), but Joseph L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-685">Mankiewicz eventually rewrote his script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-686">He worked on rewrites for several other movies, including a disastrous week on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-687">Gone With the Wind</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-688"> (he was forbidden to use any words that did not appear in Margaret Mitchell’s novel), but after </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-689">Three Comrades</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-690">, all of his projects ended in failure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-691">One, a script for Joan Crawford called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-692">Infidelity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-693">, was left uncompleted, canceled because it dealt with the theme of adultery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-694">Fitzgerald died in 1941, working on his last, unfinished novel, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-695">The Last Tycoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-696">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-697">He died believing himself to be a failure.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-698">I’ve always been intrigued by the journey of F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-699">Scott Fitzgerald. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-700">What resonates with me the most is that he was constantly searching for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-701">the answer</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-702"> to what made a good screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-703">His overwhelming external circumstances—his wife Zelda’s insti­tutio­naliz­ation, his unmanageable debts and lifestyle, his excessive drinking—all fed into his insecurities about the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-704">And make no mistake: Screenwriting is a craft, a craft that can be learned. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-705">Even though he worked excessively hard, and was disciplined and responsible, he failed to achieve the results he was so desperately striving for.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-706">Why?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-707">I don’t think there’s any one answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-708">But reading his books and writings and letters from this period, it seems clear that he was never exactly sure what a screenplay </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-709">was;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-710"> he always wondered whether he was “doing it right,” whether there were certain rules he had to follow in order to write a successful screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-711">When I was studying at the University of California, Berkeley, as an English lit major, I read the first and second editions of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-712">Tender Is the Night</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-713"> for one of my classes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-714">It is the story of a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients, who, as she slowly recovers, exhausts his vitality until he is “a man used up.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-715">The book, the last one Fitzgerald completed, was considered technically faulty and was commercially unsuccessful.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-716">In the first edition of the novel, Book I is written from the point of view of Rosemary Hoyt, a young actress who shares her observations about meeting the circle that surrounds Dick and Nicole Diver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-717">Rosemary is on the beach at Cap d’Antibes on the French Riviera, watching the Divers enjoying an outing on the sand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-718">As she watches, she sees them as a beautiful couple who appear, at least from her point of view, to have everything going for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-719">They are, she thinks, the ideal couple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-720">Rich, beautiful, intelligent, they look to be the embodiment of what everyone wants for himself or herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-721">But the second book of the novel focuses on the life of Dick and Nicole, and we learn that what we saw through Rosemary’s eyes was only the relationship they showed to the world; it was not really true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-722">The Divers have major problems, which drain them emotionally and spiritually, and ultimately destroy them.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-723">When the first edition of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-724">Tender Is the Night</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-725"> was published, sales were poor, and Fitzgerald thought he had probably been drinking too much and might have compromised his vision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-726">But from his Hollywood experience, he came to believe he did not introduce his main characters early enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-727">“Its great fault,” Fitzgerald wrote of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-728">Tender Is the Night</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-729"> to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, “is that the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-730">true</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-731"> beginning—the young psychiatrist in Switzerland—is tucked away in the middle of the book.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-732">He decided that when the second edition was printed, he would interchange the first section with the second and open the novel with Dick Diver in wartime Switzerland in order to explain the mystery about the Divers’ courtship and marriage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-733">So he opened the book focusing on the main character, Dick Diver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-734">But that didn’t work either, and Fitzgerald was crushed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-735">The book was financially unsuccessful until many years later, when Fitzgerald’s genius was finally acknowledged.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-736">What strikes me so vividly is what Fitzgerald </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-737">didn’t</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-738"> see; his opening section focusing on how Rosemary saw the Divers was more cinematic than novelistic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-739">It’s a great cinematic opening, setting up the characters as others see them, like an establishing shot; in this first edition, Fitzgerald was </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-740">showing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-741"> us how this model couple looked to the world, beautiful and rich, seeming to have everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-742">How we look to the outside world, of course, is a lot different from who we really are behind closed doors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-743">My personal feeling is that it was Fitzgerald’s insecurity about the craft of screenwriting that drove him to change that great opening.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-744">F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-745">Scott Fitzgerald was an artist literally caught between two worlds, caught between his genius as a writer and his self-doubt and inability to express that genius in screenplay form.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-746">Screenwriting is a definite craft, a definite art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-747">Over the years, I’ve read thousands upon thousands of screenplays, and I always look for certain things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-748">First, how does it look on the page? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-749">Is there plenty of white space, or are the paragraphs dense, too thick, the dialogue too long? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-750">Or is the reverse true: Is the scene description too thin, the dialogue too sparse? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-751">And this is before I read one word; this is just what it “looks” like on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-752">You’d be surprised how many decisions are made in Hollywood by the way a screenplay looks—you can tell whether it’s been written by a professional or by someone who’s still aspiring to be a professional.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-753">Everybody is writing screenplays, from the waiter at your favorite bar or restaurant to the limo driver, the doctor, the lawyer, or the barista serving up the White Chocolate Dream Latte at the local Coffee Bean. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-754">Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East, and out of that number maybe four or five hundred scripts were actually produced.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-755">What makes one screenplay better than another? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-756">There are many answers, of course, because each screenplay is unique. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-757">But if you want to sit down and spend six months to a year writing a screenplay, you first have to know what a screenplay </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-758">is—what its nature is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-759">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-760">What is a screenplay?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-761"> Is it a guide, or an outline, for a movie? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-762">A blueprint, or a diagram? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-763">Or maybe it’s a series of images, scenes, and sequences strung together with dialogue and description, like pearls on a strand? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-764">Perhaps it’s simply the landscape of a dream?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-765">Well, for one thing, a screenplay is not a novel, and it’s most certainly not a play. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-766">If you look at a novel and try to define its fundamental nature, you’ll see that the dramatic action, the story line, usually takes place inside the head of the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-767">We see the story line unfold through the eyes of the character, through his/her point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-768">We are privy to the character’s thoughts, feelings, emotions, words, actions, memories, dreams, hopes, ambitions, opinions, and more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-769">The character and reader go through the action together, sharing in the drama and emotion of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-770">We know how they act, feel, react, and figure things out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-771">If other characters appear and are brought into the narrative line of action, then the story embraces their point of view, but the main thrust of the story line always returns to the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-772">The main character is who the story is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-773">In a novel the action takes place inside the character’s head, within the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-774">mindscape</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-775"> of dramatic action.</span></p>

		<p class="a_head"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-841">ACT I IS THE SET-UP</span></i></p>
		<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-842">If a screenplay is a story told with pictures, then what do all stories have in common? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-843">A beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily, as mentioned, in that order; it is a story told in pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-844">Aristotle talked about the three unities of dramatic action: time, place, and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-845">The normal Hollywood film is approximately two hours long, or 120 minutes; foreign films tend to be a little shorter, though that’s changing as we bridge the language of international film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-846">But in most cases, films are approximately two hours in length, give or take a few minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-847">This is a standard length, and today, when a contract is written in Hollywood between the filmmaker and production company, it states that when the movie is delivered, it will be no longer than 2 hours and 8 minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-848">That’s approximately 128 pages of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-849">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-850">Because it’s an economic decision that has evolved over the years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-851">At this writing, it costs approximately $10,000 to $12,000 per minute (and getting higher and higher every year) to shoot a Hollywood studio film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-852">Second, a two-hour movie has a definite advantage in the theaters simply because you can get in more viewings of the movie per day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-853">More screenings mean more money; more theaters mean more screenings, which means more money will be made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-854">Movies are show </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-855">business</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-856">, after all, and with the cost of moviemaking being so high, and getting higher as our technology evolves, today it’s really more business than show.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-857">The way it breaks down is this: One page of screenplay is approximately one minute of screen time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-858">It doesn’t matter whether the script is all action, all dialogue, or any combination of the two—generally speaking, a page of screenplay equals a minute of screen time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-859">It’s a good rule of thumb to follow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-860">There are exceptions to this, of course. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-861">The script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-862">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-863"> is only 118 pages, but the movie is more than three hours long.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-864">Act I, the beginning, is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately twenty or thirty pages long and is held together with the dramatic context known as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-865">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-866">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-867">Context is the space that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-868">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-869"> something in place—in this case, the content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-870">For example, the space inside a glass is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-871">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-872">; it holds the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-873">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-874"> in place—whether it’s water, beer, milk, coffee, tea, or juice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-875">If we want to get creative, a glass can also hold raisins, trail mix, nuts, grapes, etc.—but the space inside doesn’t change The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-876">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-877"> is what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-878">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-879"> the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-880">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-881"> in place.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-882">In this unit of dramatic action, Act I, the screenwriter </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-883">sets up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-884"> the story, establishes character, launches the dramatic premise (what the story is about), illustrates the situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and creates the relationships between the main character and the other characters who inhabit the landscape of his or her world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-885">As a writer you’ve only got about ten minutes to establish this, because the audience members can usually determine, either consciously or unconsciously, whether they do or don’t like the movie by that time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-886">If they don’t know what’s going on and the opening is vague or boring, their concentration and focus will falter and start wandering.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-887">Check it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-888">The next time you go to a movie, do a little exercise: Find out how long it takes you to make a decision about whether you like the film or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-889">A good indication is if you start thinking about getting something from the refreshment stand or find yourself shifting in your seat; if that happens, the chances are the filmmaker has lost you as a viewer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-890">Ten minutes is ten pages of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-891">I cannot emphasize enough that this first ten-page unit of dramatic action is the most important part of the screenplay.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1637">One of the most articulate literary theorists of the nineteenth century was the great American novelist Henry James, author of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1638">Portrait of a Lady, Wings of the Dove, Turn of the Screw</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1639">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1640">Daisy Miller</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1641">, among other masterworks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1642">James was fascinated with the art of fiction writing, and approached it like a scientist, the same way his brother, William James, the famous psychologist, studied the dynamics of the human mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1643">Henry James wrote several essays trying to document and define the intricacies of creating character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1644">In one of those essays, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1645">The Art of Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1646">, James poses a literary question: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1647">What is character but the determination of incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1648">And what is incident but the illumination of character?</span></i></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1649">It’s a profound statement.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1650">The key word, of course, is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1651">incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1652">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1653">According to the dictionary, an incident is “a specific occurrence or event that occurs in connection or relationship to something else.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1654">Screenplays are usually about a key incident, and the story is the character acting and reacting to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1655">It is the major source of all action and all character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1656">After twenty-five years of reading and analyzing screenplays and movies, I have only recently begun to understand the importance of the incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1657">All good movies, it seems, focus on the unfolding of a specific incident or event; and it is this incident that becomes the engine that powers the story to its completion.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1674">Events in a screenplay are specifically designed to bring out the truth about the characters so that we, the reader and audience, can transcend our ordinary lives and achieve a connection, or bond, between “them and us.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1675">We see ourselves in them and enjoy a moment, perhaps, of recognition and understanding.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1676">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1677">The Art of Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1678">, Henry James says that the incidents you create for your characters are the best ways to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1679">illuminate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1680"> who they are—that is, reveal their true nature, their essential character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1681">How they respond to a particular incident or event, how they act and react, what they say and do is what really defines the essence of their character.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1682">How can we relate this concept to the process of creating character?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1683">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1684"> (Callie Khouri) is a story about two women who kill a man, then attempt to flee the law and escape to Mexico, but get caught at the Grand Canyon and, rather than go to prison, choose to take their own lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1685">If you take a look at these two characters, they are two distinct, individual people who have the same dramatic need: to escape safely to Mexico. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1686">They are different aspects of each other, and they share everything, their life as well as their death. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1687">And during the course of their journey, we get to know them, love them, and wish that things might have been different.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1688">The reason why Henry James’s statement is so relevant is because the elements </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1689">within</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1690"> the character really determine the incident; how the character reacts to that incident is what illuminates and truly defines his/her character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1691">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1692">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1693">, it’s set up immediately, at the beginning of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1694">Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) set out for a weekend holiday in the mountains, stop at a bar, and meet a guy named Harlan, who takes a liking to Thelma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1695">He plies her with drinks, then attempts to rape her in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1696">It turns ugly, until Louise comes along, threatens Harlan with Thelma’s gun, and, when he mouths off to her, loses it, pulls the trigger, and kills him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1697">Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1698">It is the key incident in the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1699">Now the “real” story is about their attempt to escape to Mexico.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1700">As mentioned, Plot Point I is the true beginning of the screenplay and swings the story around into Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1701">For the rest of the story, Thelma and Louise are on the run. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1702">As they race down the highway of their life, like so many other characters in so many other movies, they are forced to come to grips with themselves, find out who they really are, and ultimately take responsibility for their lives and actions. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1703">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1704"> is a road movie, yes, but it’s really a journey of enlightenment, a journey of self-discovery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1705">And it begins with the incident, the hub of the wheel of action.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1706">It is the character that determines the incident, in this case Louise’s killing Harlan, then fleeing in fear and uncertainty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1707">What’s important for me, and you, as writers, is to ask what it was within Louise’s character that caused her to pull the trigger—because this incident is what ultimately reveals and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1708">illuminates</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1709"> the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1710">In Louise’s case, it is an incident that happened to her when she was a young woman; it’s only mentioned briefly, but it’s implied that she was raped in Texas and then brought charges against her attackers, but could get no satisfaction, no revenge, no justice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1711">Indeed, instead of being seen as the victim, she was considered by many to have been the instigator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1712">At that moment, she made a promise to herself: She would never take one step inside the state of Texas ever again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1713">This decision ultimately brings about her death.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1714">Joseph Campbell reflects in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1715">The Power of Myth</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1716"> that in mythic terms, the first part of any journey of initiation must deal with the death of the old self and the resurrection of the new. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1717">Campbell says that the hero, or heroic figure, “moves not into outer space but into inward space, to the place from which all being comes, into the consciousness that is the source of all things, the kingdom of heaven within. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1718">The images are outward, but their reflection is inward.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1719">It seems to me that the Louise in Act I who pulled the trigger, killing Harlan, is not the Louise who really killed him; rather, it was the young Louise, caught in the web of female justice, Texas style, who actually pulled that trigger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1720">She never recovered from her experience, and it simmered in her consciousness below the thin veneer of time and memory, just waiting for a chance to erupt.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1721">Writers create characters in a variety of different ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1722">I once asked Waldo Salt how he went about creating characters, and he replied that the first thing he did was to choose a simple dramatic need; then he would add to it, coloring it until it became a universal chord common to Everyman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1723">For Waldo, that became the essence of his character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1724">And he was a master screenwriter, a major artist.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1725">What’s the best way to go about creating character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1726">And how do you establish a relationship between your character, his or her dramatic choices, and the story you’re telling? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1727">How do you determine whether your character will drive a car, or ride a bicycle, or take the bus or subway, and what kind of paintings or posters hang in his/her house or apartment?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1728">Character is the essential internal foundation of your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1729">The cornerstone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1730">It is the heart and soul and nervous system of your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1731">Before you can put one word down on paper, you must know your character.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1732">In a screenplay, the story always moves forward, from beginning to end, whether in a linear or nonlinear fashion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1733">It doesn’t matter if it’s a story like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1734">Titanic</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1735"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1736">The Hours; Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1737"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1738">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1739"> (Anthony Minghella); </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1740">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1741"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1742">Memento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1743"> (Christopher Nolan). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1744">The way you drive your story forward is by focusing on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1745">actions</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1746"> of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1747">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1748"> and the dramatic choices he or she makes during the narrative story line.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2285">I wanted to write characters like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2286">I wanted to enrich the characters in my screenplays so that they were fully formed and realized, multidimensional, real people in real situations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2287">So I started asking myself questions: How do you take the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2288">idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2289"> of a person that exists in a scrambled, fragmented form and make him or her into a living, flesh-and-blood person, a person you can relate to and identify with? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2290">How do you go about putting life into your characters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2291">How do you build character?</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2781">What’s his background?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2782">We toss a lot of ideas around and finally end up with this: Lionel Townsend belongs to the upper strata of Boston society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2783">Wealthy, smart, conservative, he attended medical school at Boston University, then went to St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2784">Louis to do his internship at Washington University.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2785">What about Sarah’s mother? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2786">What was she before she became a doctor’s wife?</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2793">“When did Sarah’s parents get married?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2794">I ask.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2795">If Sarah’s in her late twenties, early thirties, her parents must have married in the early ’70s, either during or after the Vietnam War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2796">They’ve been married more than thirty years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2797">“How’d you figure that out?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2798">someone asks.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2799">“Subtraction,” I reply.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2800">What’s the relationship between mother and father?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2801">Consistent, and possibly routine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2802">For what it’s worth, I add, Sarah’s mother’s a Capricorn, her father’s a Libra.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2803">When was Sarah born?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2804">Early or mid ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2805">April, an Aries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2806">Does she have any brothers or sisters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2807">No, she’s an only child.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2808">Remember, this is a process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2809">For every question asked there are many answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2810">If you don’t agree with them, change them to create your own character.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2811">What kind of childhood did she have?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2812">A lonely one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2813">She wanted brothers and sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2814">She was alone most of the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2815">She probably had a good relationship with her mother until she was in her teens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2816">Then, as always between parent and child, things went haywire.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2817">What’s the relationship between Sarah and her father?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2818">Good, but strained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2819">Possibly he wanted a son instead of a daughter, and to please her father, Sarah became a tomboy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2820">Possibly Sarah is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2821">always</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2822"> trying to find a way to please her father, to earn his love and affection. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2823">Becoming a tomboy helps with this problem, but creates another one by antagonizing her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2824">This will figure later in her relationships with men.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2825">Sarah’s family is like all other families, but we’re sketching in as much detailed conflict as we can for dramatic purposes.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2826">We’re beginning to grasp the dynamics of the Townsend family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2827">So far, there’s not been too much disagreement, so we continue to explore the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2828">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2829"> of Sarah Townsend.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2830">I remark that many young women search for their father or for father figures throughout their lives, much in the way that many men search for their mothers in the women they meet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2831">It’s interesting to use this as a foundation of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2832">Not that it happens all the time, but it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2833">does</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2834"> happen; therefore let’s be aware of it so that we can possibly use it to our advantage.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2835">There’s a lot of discussion about this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2836">I explain that when you’re creating a character, you have to compile nuances that you can either use or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2837">I tell the class this exercise is based on trial and error: We’re going to use what works and discard what doesn’t.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2838">Her mother probably educates Sarah in the ways of the world and, no doubt, cautions her about men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2839">She might tell her daughter, “You can never trust a man. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2840">They’re only after one thing—your body.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2841">Or, “They don’t like a woman who’s too smart.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2842">And so on and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2843">What Sarah’s mother tells her may be true for some of you, or it may not be, I tell the class; use your own experience in creating a character.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2844">Perhaps at an early age Sarah expressed the desire to become a doctor, like her father, and her mother cautioned her against that, saying, “It’s a long, tough grind.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2845">Maybe her mother is a person who wants to be right all the time, or a person for whom looking good, appearance, is everything, like Mary Tyler Moore’s character in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2846">Ordinary People</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2847"> (Alvin Sargent). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2848">Let’s move on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2849">What kind of high school experience did Sarah have?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2850">Active, social, the beginnings of rebellion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2851">She made good grades without having to work very hard for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2852">She had many friends, and was a leader in rebelling against many of the school’s restrictive policies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2853">Her music tastes became eclectic and her parents endured these years with patience but not too much understanding.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2854">Most young people rebel, and Sarah’s no exception. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2855">She graduates and goes to Vassar, which pleases her mother, but decides she wants to major in political science because she wants to help change “the system.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2856">This, of course, upsets her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2857">Sarah is socially active, and has an affair with a graduate student in political science. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2858">Her actions, based on her rebellious nature, become part of her character—she has a unique point of view, a determined attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2859">She graduates from college with a degree in political science.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2860">Now what?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2861">She moves to New York to get a job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2862">Her father supports her in this move. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2863">Her mother does not; she’s upset. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2864">She believes Sarah’s not doing the things she “should” be doing—finding a stable career, possibly marrying and settling down, as befits an intelligent young woman from Boston.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2865">Remember, I add, drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2866">We’re searching for ways to generate tension in our material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2867">I explain that the relationship between mother and daughter may be useful during the screenplay, or it may not be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2868">Let’s see whether it works or not before we make any decision about it, I advise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2869">The writer always operates from the position of choice and responsibility.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2870">Sarah’s move to New York is a major crossroads in our creation of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2871">So far, we’ve focused on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2872">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2873"> of Sarah Townsend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2874">Now we’re going to be creating </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2875">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2876">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2877">Let’s define the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2878">exterior</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2879"> forces working on Sarah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2880">Here’s the diagram:</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2882">Let’s explore the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2883">exterior</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2884"> forces working on Sarah.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2885">At this point, someone suggests that we create a story using a war as backdrop or as the context of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2886">We talk about that for a bit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2887">I ask, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2888">Which</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2889"> war? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2890">The Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the war in Iraq (even the Korean War or World War II)—all of them, no matter in what period of history they occurred, would lend some background tension to our story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2891">We discuss this.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2892">We decide it’s a good idea, and I suggest that we could use the Vietnam War as the background of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2893">All it means is changing some of the background events and dates working on Sarah. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2894">We decide to try it and see what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2895">The events we’ve created are still valid to some degree, and will not have to be changed radically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2896">We change what we need to, get our time lines straight, and decide that Sarah leaves college and moves to New York in the early ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2897">So, we research the times.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2898">Slowly, the story begins to take shape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2899">Sarah arrives in New York City in the spring in the early ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2900">What does she do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2901">Gets an apartment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2902">Her father sends her some money each month, and does not tell her mother; Sarah prefers it that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2903">Then what?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2904">She gets a job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2905">What kind of job does she get?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2906">Let’s discuss that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2907">We know basically the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2908">kind</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2909"> of person Sarah is: upper-middle-class, independent, free-spirited, rebellious, on her own for the first time and loving it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2910">Committed to herself and her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2911">Let’s start getting more specific.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2912">New York, 1972. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2913">What are the exterior forces working on Sarah? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2914">Here’s where some research would come in handy.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2915">Nixon is in the White House. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2916">The Vietnam War still rages; the country is in a state of nervous exhaustion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2917">Nixon goes to China. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2918">McGovern’s gaining in the presidential primaries and there’s hope “he might be the one.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2919">George Wallace is gunned down in a shopping center. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2920">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2921"> is in release. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2922">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2923"> is in production.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2924">What kind of job would fit Sarah dramatically?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2925">A job working for a political campaign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2926">Someone suggests Sarah could be working at the McGovern headquarters in New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2927">This is a point of discussion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2928">(If we wanted to make this a contemporary story, using the war in Iraq as a background force, we could easily have Sarah working for John Kerry’s campaign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2929">The context would be the same, only the content would change.) We talk about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2930">Finally, I explain that for me the job satisfies her rebellious nature; it reflects her first independent step away from home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2931">It satisfies her activist political stance and draws upon her background as a political science major in college, and it gives her parents something to disapprove of—both of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2932">We’re going after conflict, right?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2933">From now on, through a process of trial and error, we’re going to be searching for a theme, or dramatic premise: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2934">something</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2935"> that will move Sarah in a particular direction to generate a dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2936">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2937">subject</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2938"> of a screenplay, remember, is an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2939">action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2940"> and a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2941">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2942">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2943">We’ve got the character; now we’ve got to find the action.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3397">The first draft of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3398">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3399"> is much more romantic than the others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3400">In this draft, Robert Towne has Jake Gittes opening and closing the story with a voice-over narration, just the way Raymond Chandler does in most of his stories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3401">When Evelyn Mulwray walks into Jake Gittes’s life, he becomes involved with a woman from a different class; she is wealthy, sophisticated, and beautiful, and he falls head over heels in love with her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3402">Near the end of the story, when she learns that her father, Noah Cross (John Huston), has attempted to hire Gittes to find her daughter/sister, she realizes that her father will stop at nothing to get the girl, so she sets out to kill him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3403">She knows it’s the only solution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3404">She phones Noah Cross and tells him to meet her along a deserted part of the coast near San Pedro. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3405">When Cross arrives, it is raining heavily, and as he walks up the dirt road looking for his daughter, she jams down her car’s accelerator and tries to run him over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3406">He narrowly escapes and races to a marshy area nearby. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3407">Evelyn leaves the car, pulls a gun, and begins tracking him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3408">Shots are fired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3409">He hides behind a large wooden sign advertising fresh bait. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3410">Evelyn sees him and fires again and again into the sign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3411">Blood mingles with the falling rain and Noah Cross falls over backward, dead.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3412">A few moments later, Gittes and Lieutenant Escobar arrive at the scene and we cut to various shots of modern-day Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3413">Gittes, in voice-over narration, tells us that Evelyn Mulwray spent four years in prison for killing her father, that he managed to get her daughter/sister safely back to Mexico, and that the land scheme Noah Cross so brilliantly conceived resulted in a profit of about $300 million. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3414">The resolution of this first draft is that justice and order prevail: Noah Cross gets what he deserves, and the graft and corruption of the water scandal leads to Los Angeles becoming what it is today.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3415">That was the first draft.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3416">At that point, Robert Evans, the producer (and the man responsible for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3417">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3418"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3419">Love Story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3420">), brought in Roman Polanski </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3421">(The Pianist)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3422"> as director. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3423">Polanski had his own ideas about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3424">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3425">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3426">Changes were discussed, then made, and the relations between Polanski and Towne became tense and strained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3427">They disagreed about many things, mostly about the ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3428">Polanski wanted an ending in which Noah Cross got away with murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3429">The second draft is therefore altered considerably. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3430">It is less romantic, the action is trimmed and tightened, and the focus of the resolution changed substantially. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3431">The second draft is very close to the final one.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3432">In this second draft, Noah Cross gets away with murder, graft, and incest, and Evelyn Mulwray becomes the innocent victim who pays for her father’s crime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3433">Towne’s point of view when he began writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3434">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3435"> is that those who commit certain types of crimes, like murder, robbery, rape, or arson, are punished by being sent to prison, but those who commit crimes against an entire community are often rewarded by having streets named after them or plaques dedicated to them at City Hall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3436">Los Angeles literally owes its survival to the water scandal known as the Rape of the Owens Valley, and it provides the backdrop of the film.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3437">The ending of the second draft now has Gittes planning to meet Evelyn Mulwray in Chinatown; he has arranged for her to be taken to Mexico by Curly (Burt Young), the man in the opening scene, and her daughter/sister is waiting at the boat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3438">Gittes has discovered that Cross is the man behind the murders as well as the water scandal, and when Gittes accuses him, Cross takes him prisoner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3439">They leave for Chinatown, and when they arrive, Cross tries to detain Evelyn, but Gittes manages to subdue the older man. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3440">Evelyn races to her car, only to be blocked by Lieutenant Escobar. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3441">Gittes makes a drastic move and lunges at the policeman; during the scuffle, Evelyn drives away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3442">Shots are fired and she is killed, shot in the head. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3443">This is close to the final draft.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3444">The last scene shows Noah Cross weeping over Evelyn’s body while a stunned Gittes tells Escobar that Cross is the man responsible for everything.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3445">In the third, and final, draft, the ending has been modified slightly to accent Towne’s point of view, but the resolution is still the same as in the second draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3446">Gittes is taken to Chinatown, but Lieutenant Escobar is already there, and arrests the private detective for withholding evidence, putting him in handcuffs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3447">When Evelyn arrives with her daughter/sister, Cross approaches the young girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3448">Evelyn tells him to stay away, and when he doesn’t, she pulls a gun and shoots him in the arm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3449">She gets into her car and drives off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3450">There is a shot fired, and Evelyn is killed, shot through the eye. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3451">(As a side note, Sophocles has Oedipus tear out his eyes when he realizes he has committed incest with his mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3452">I find this an intriguing parallel, whether intentional or not.)</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3453">Horrified by Evelyn’s death, Cross puts his arm protectively around his daughter/granddaughter and forcefully whisks her away into the darkness.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3454">“Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3455">Noah Cross, indeed, gets away with it all: murder, the water scandal, the girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3456">“You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it,” Gittes tells Curly in the opening scene.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3733">If I could sum up the concept of endings and state the one most important thing to remember, I would say: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3734">The ending comes out of the beginning</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3735">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3736">Someone, or something, initiates an action, and how that action is resolved becomes the story line of the film.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3737">The Chinese say that “the longest journey begins with the first step,” and in many philosophical systems “endings and beginnings” are connected; as in the concept of yin and yang, two concentric circles joined together, forever united, forever opposed.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3738">If you can find a way to illustrate this in your screenplay, it is to your advantage.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3739">This is something you can study. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3740">Read as many scripts as you can. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3741">There are several Web sites that offer downloadable screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3742">Just Google “screenplays” and check out the sites. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3743">And you should be seeing and analyzing as many films as you can, at least two movies a week, either in movie theaters or on DVD or video. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3744">Movies are available to everyone now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3745">You should see all kinds of movies: good films, bad films, foreign films, old films, new films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3746">Every film you see becomes a learning experience; if you examine it, it will generate a process, giving you an expanded awareness of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3747">A movie should be viewed as a working session: Talk about it, discuss it with friends or loved ones; see whether you can isolate its structure; see whether it fits the paradigm or not.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3880">The film began, and as the story unfolded, my critical mind kicked in and I started a little dialogue in which I was complaining about the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3881">I thought it was flat, the characters dull and one-dimensional. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3882">Before I knew it, I had nodded off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3883">I don’t know how much of the film I missed, I just knew it was one of those evenings where my body was in the screening room, but I certainly was not.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3884">When I heard the last lines of the film, “Forget it, Jake….It’s Chinatown,” that’s exactly what I wanted to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3885">By the time I got home, I had already forgotten about it.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3889">A short time later, I had the opportunity to interview Robert Towne, and during the course of our conversation I asked how he went about creating his characters, especially how he conceived Jake Gittes, the Jack Nicholson character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3890">He replied that the first question he often asks himself when approaching his character is “What is this character afraid of?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3891">In other words, what is his/her deepest fear? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3892">Gittes, a private detective who specializes in “discreet investigation,” has a certain reputation to uphold, so he always wants to “look good.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3893">He does everything to make a good impression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3894">He dresses immaculately, has his shoes shined every day, and has his own code of ethics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3895">Gittes’s unspoken, deep-seated fear is not being taken seriously, looking foolish.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3896">I was very impressed with Bob Towne, both by what he said and how he said it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3897">He was open, insightful, articulate, engaging, and extremely literate, qualities I genuinely admire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3898">I was so impressed that I wanted to see </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3899">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3900"> again; I wanted to see if I’d be able to catch those little nuances of character and story that Towne had spoken about that I had missed during my first viewing of the film.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3901">So, one night after work, I went to see it again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3902">And this time, by the end of the film, when Evelyn Mulwray, the innocent victim, is killed in Chinatown, I felt I had really seen the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3903">When I heard that familiar last line, “Forget it, Jake It’s Chinatown,” I was touched, moved, and inspired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3904">The film lingered with me over the next few days, and various scenes kept coming back to mind.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3910">From the very first images on screen—a series of photographs showing a man and woman having sex in the park—we know this is a story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3911">Over these pictures, we hear the moans and groans of Curly, the husband of the woman, played by Burt Young. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3912">What does this show? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3913">What Jake Gittes, the main character, does for a living. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3914">He’s a private detective specializing in divorces, unfaithful spouses, and “going through other people’s dirty linen,” as one of the characters remarks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3915">It’s his métier.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4336">When Gittes tracks down and takes pictures of “the little twist” Mulwray is supposedly having an affair with, as far as he is concerned, the case is closed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4337">The next day he’s surprised to find the pictures he took on the front page of the newspaper, with headlines declaring that the head of the Department of Water and Power has been “caught” in a love nest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4338">He doesn’t know how his pictures got into the paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4339">When he returns to his office he is further surprised to find the real Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4340">Mulwray there to greet him—the key incident and the Plot Point at the end of Act I.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4367">In the interview I did with Robert Towne, he said he approached </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4368">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4369"> from the point of view that “some crimes are punished because they can be punished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4370">If you kill somebody, rob or rape somebody, you’ll be caught and thrown into jail. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4371">But crimes against an entire community you really can’t punish, so you end up rewarding them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4372">You know, those people who get their names on streets and plaques at City Hall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4373">And that’s the basic point of view of the story.”</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4377">Gittes responds with the prophetic lines that illustrate the script’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4378">“You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4379">You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class?”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4380">Curly certainly can’t get away with murder, but Noah Cross, Evelyn Mulwray’s father and former head of the Department of Water and Power along with Hollis Mulwray, can and does get away with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4381">The ending of the film shows Noah Cross whisking his daughter/granddaughter into the night after Evelyn Mulwray is killed trying to escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4382">That is Towne’s point of view: “You gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody, and get away with it.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4383">That brings us to the “crime” of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4384">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4385">, a scheme based on the water scandal known as the Rape of the Owens Valley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4386">It is the backdrop of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4387">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4388">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4389">In 1900, the city of Los Angeles, “a desert community,” as former mayor Bagby reminds us, was growing and expanding so fast it was literally running out of water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4390">If the city was to survive, it had to find another source of water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4391">L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4392">is right next door to the Pacific Ocean. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4393">“You can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail on it, but you can’t drink it, you can’t water your lawns with it, and you can’t irrigate an orange grove with it,” Bagby argues.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4394">The closest water to L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4395">is the Owens River, located in the Owens Valley, a green and fertile area about 250 miles northeast of Los Angeles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4396">A group of businessmen, community leaders, and politicians—some would call them “men of vision”—saw the need for water and conceived a marvelous scheme. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4397">They would buy up the river rights to the Owens River, by force if necessary, then buy up all that worthless land in the San Fernando Valley, about 20 miles outside L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4398">Then they would place a bond issue on the ballot that would fund building an aqueduct from the Owens Valley across 250 miles of blazing desert and jagged foothills to the San Fernando Valley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4399">Then they would turn around and sell the now “fertile” land of the San Fernando Valley to the city of Los Angeles for an enormous sum of money, about $300 million.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4400">That was the plan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4401">The government knew about it, the newspapers knew about it, the local politicians knew about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4402">When the time was right, the authorities would “influence” the people of Los Angeles to pass the proposed bond issue.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4403">In 1906, Los Angeles was in the middle of a drought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4404">Things got bad, then worse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4405">People were forbidden to wash their cars or water their lawns; they couldn’t flush their toilets more than a few times a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4406">The city dried up; flowers died, lawns turned brown, and scare headlines declared, “Los Angeles is dying of thirst!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4407">and “Save our city!”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4408">To underscore the drastic need for water during the drought and to make certain the citizens passed the bond issue, the Department of Water and Power dumped thousands of gallons of water into the ocean.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4409">When it came time to vote, the bond issue passed easily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4410">The Owens Valley aqueduct took several years to complete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4411">When it was finished, William Mulholland, then head of the Department of Water and Power, turned the water over to the city: “There it is,” he said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4412">“Take it.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4413">Los Angeles flourished and grew like wildfire; the Owens Valley withered and died. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4414">No wonder it was called the Rape of the Owens Valley.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4415">Robert Towne took this scandal from 1906 and used it as the backdrop in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4416">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4417">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4418">He changed the time period from the turn of the century to 1937, when the visual elements of Los Angeles had the classic and distinctive look of Southern California.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4419">The water scandal that Noah Cross (how appropriate his name) conceives and executes, the crime that causes the deaths of Hollis Mulwray, Leroy the drunk, Ida Sessions, and finally Evelyn Mulwray, the scandal that Jake Gittes uncovers, is woven with great subtlety and skill through the entire screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4420">And Noah Cross gets away with murder.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4421">All this is established and set up on page 8, when Gittes is in the council chambers and we hear Bagby arguing that “eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the deserts from our streets—and not on top of them.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4422">Hollis Mulwray, the character modeled on William Mulholland, replies that the dam site is unsafe, as proven by the previous Van der Lip Dam disaster, and says, “I won’t build it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4423">It’s that simple—I am not making that kind of mistake twice.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4424">By refusing to build the dam, Hollis Mulwray becomes a target for murder; he is an obstacle that must be eliminated.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4425">Again, on page 10, the dramatic question of the screenplay is raised: “You steal the water from the Valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock,” yells the farmer who invades the chambers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4426">“Who’s paying you to do that, Mr. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4427">Mulwray, that’s what I want to know!”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4428">So does Gittes.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4429">It is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4430">the</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4431"> question that propels the story to its final resolution, and it is all </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4432">set up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4433"> from the very beginning, in the first ten pages, and moves forward in a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4434">linear</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4435"> direction to the end.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4436">“Either you bring the water to L.A., or you bring L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4437">to the water,” Noah Cross tells Gittes.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4438">That is the foundation of the entire story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4439">That’s what makes it so great.</span></p>

		<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4452">A few years ago I was given the opportunity of working with the writer Joe Eszterhas in a complicated legal case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4453">Called as an expert witness, I was engaged to go through the entire work of this noted screenwriter, analyze the material, and then, in outline form, lay out “the structural essence” of his screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4454">In other words, what was it that made Joe Eszterhas’s material so singular and unique; what made Joe Eszterhas “Joe Eszterhas”?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4455">It was a daunting and intriguing assignment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4456">I didn’t know what to do or how to begin, except to begin at the beginning, by reading his screenplays and noting the similarities and distinctions in the creation of Eszterhas’s style.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4457">As I began reading and analyzing his work, I became aware of several factors that seemed to make his scripts so powerful, whether they were action-thrillers like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4458">Basic Instinct, Jagged Edge, Jade</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4459">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4460">Sliver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4461">, or dramatic and contemporary pieces like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4462">Music Box, Flashdance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4463">, and even the ill-wrought </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4464">Showgirls</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4465">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4466">In all his work I saw he was dealing with real people in real situations, and his characters were interesting, tough, with a sense of bravado that covered a deep well of insecurity and sometimes a lack of self-respect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4467">For instance, the Jennifer Beals character in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4468">Flashdance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4469"> had a sense of creative and defiant confidence within her that engaged reader and audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4470">And there was the music, of course, woven into the story of the girl who overcame all odds—physical, mental, and emotional—to achieve her dream. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4471">A steelworker by day and a pole dancer by night, she had a visual appeal to a vast moviegoing audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4472">The film was an enormous hit.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4473">As I began to get more familiar with Joe Eszterhas’s scripts, I noticed that he thrust the reader and audience into the story line immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4474">In most cases, he began his stories with an action sequence that plunged the main character directly into the story line.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4475">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4476">Basic Instinct</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4477">, the first words of the script—“It is dark; we don’t see clearly”—set the tone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4478">The visual directions continue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4479">“A man and woman make love on a brass bed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4480">There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4481">On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4482">A tape deck PLAYS the Stones: ‘Sympathy for the Devil.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4483">”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4484">It is a graphic, wild, and erotic sex scene, the tempo tight and passion high; as it builds in rhythm, the words get shorter and shorter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4485">“He is inside her…arms tied above him…on his back…eyes closed…she moves…grinding…he strains for her…his head arches back…his throat white…she arches her back…her hips grind…her breasts are high…” and then, at the height of the sexual frenzy, “Her back arches back…back…her head tilts back…she extends her arms…her right arm comes down suddenly…the steel flashes…his throat is white…he bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses…” and the ice pick flashes up and down, “and up…and down…and up…and….”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4486">When I first read this opening scene I was totally riveted, focused, eager to continue reading and see what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4487">The more I read, the more I was hooked. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4488">I had been attracted, engaged, and totally captured by the visual action of the first page.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4489">It’s a perfect example of what I call a visual “grabber,” an opening that grabs you by the throat and seizes your attention. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4490">What better elements can you open a screenplay with than intense passion, wild sex, horrific murder, and visual mayhem, set to the music of The Stones, to boldly establish the style and tone of an entire screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4491">It’s just a great opening.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4492">The next morning, the main character, Nick Curran (Michael Douglas), a tough, hard-nosed, cynical cop with too many years on the force for his relatively youthful age, investigates the crime scene along with his partner and learns that the likely suspect, Catherine (Sharon Stone), is a smart, beautiful, and accomplished novelist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4493">And while he questions her, Nick is immediately attracted as she daringly flaunts her sexuality at him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4494">It’s easy to see why he’s smitten and intrigued by her, and we know the temptation she offers is going to hook him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4495">It doesn’t take too long before he becomes so infatuated with her that he can’t listen to his voice of reason, or his associates’ warnings, as he plunges headlong into a tumultuous affair that costs him his job and may wind up costing him his life.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4496">I began to understand that this opening sex/murder scene is the incident that sets the story in motion and directly draws the main character into the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4497">The murder is committed to grab our attention and show us the reason Nick is called upon to investigate the crime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4498">When he leaves the scene of the crime, we follow him and his partner and begin to learn more about this man and the choices he makes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4499">The opening scene and the story that’s going to unfold are directly linked.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4500">This incident—the murder—and the story of a cop giving in to his temptations epitomize the illumination of character and incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4501">Remember Henry James: “What is character but the determination of incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4502">And what is incident but the illumination of character?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4503">You can’t reveal a character dramatically (or comedically) unless you have him/her react to a particular incident; the nature of drama, after all, is to show the universal connection between all humans, regardless of race, color, gender, or cultural differences.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4515">When I understood this connection, it was almost a revelation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4516">Using an opening sequence to draw the main character into the story line is pure cinema. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4517">From here on through the rest of the screenplay, the story is set up, the characters and premise are established, and there is a story line, a direction to follow—and all because of the connection between these two incidents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4518">This new understanding gave me another tool to use in the craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4519">I went back through all of Eszterhas’s scripts and began to examine his screenplays, focusing on how he wrote and structured opening scenes or sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4520">And I saw, in most cases, that the opening scene, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4521">inciting incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4522">, was a cinematic tool he used to set up the story from page one, word one.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4523">I began to see that in certain kinds of movies—action films, action-thrillers, mysteries, action-adventures, sci-fis, even dramas—writers structure their stories so that this opening, the inciting incident, serves two distinct functions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4524">First, it grabs or hooks the audience immediately—just look at the opening scenes or sequences of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4525">The Matrix, Jaws, Cold Mountain, The Bridges of Madison County, American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4526">, and other films, and you’ll see that this opening scene or sequence is what sets the entire story in motion.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4872">Structuring a nonlinear movie means defining each part, then structuring each section, whether in present time or past time, from beginning to end, at which point the screenwriter can build and arrange the parts in any order he or she desires. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4873">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4874"> (Patrick Sheane Duncan) is a good example of this, as is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4875">Groundhog Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4876"> (Danny Rubin, Harold Ramis), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4877">The Usual Suspects, The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4878">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4879">Sliding Doors</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4880"> (Peter Howitt). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4881">These screenplays are introduced with the inciting incident, then structured around the key incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4882">Take a look at any of these films and see if you can identify and make the distinction between the inciting incident and the key incident.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4883">In my screenwriting workshops, I have my students focus on and define these two incidents before they write one word of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4884">Once they know what the incidents are, they can fuse the action, characters, and events into a structured line of dramatic action, whether using a linear or nonlinear story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4885">It’s important to remember that structure is not something embedded in concrete, or something that is unbending, or unyielding; rather, it is flexible, like a tree that bends in the wind but doesn’t break. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4886">Understanding this concept allows you to play with the plotline so you can tell your stories visually, with narrative action rather than explanation.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4887">This is a relatively new shift in the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4888">It wasn’t too long ago that characters had to explain who they were, what their background was, and what their motivation or purpose was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4889">Things were explained through the character’s dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4890">As a matter of fact, explaining their story line through dialogue was one of the chief problems that aspiring screenwriters had when writing their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4891">But there is a new generation of young people growing up with television, wireless technology, and PlayStation, and it’s pretty obvious their visual sense is heightened; as a result, we’re expanding the craft with stories that are more visual, while unfolding with clarity and simplicity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4892">It is a clear sign of evolution at work.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4893">But though the form may be evolving, the simple tools of storytelling remain the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4894">What you write is just as important as how you write it.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4979">The thrust of the script moves relentlessly forward from Plot Point to Plot Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4980">As a matter of fact, the characters’ arc and the arc of the story line impact each other, so that each physical incident reveals a different aspect of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4981">Foxx’s cabbie goes through a strong dramatic arc: from passive wimp to man of action; from dreamer to achiever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4982">And the irony, of course, is that Max is forced into these changes by the villain of the piece; when Cruise destroys his old life, Foxx is forced to grab the new.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4983">The script opens with Vincent arriving at LAX and exchanging a black bag with an unknown accomplice; then we cut to and set up Max cleaning his taxi as he readies himself for the night shift. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4984">He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith)—the inciting incident—and during the ride downtown they develop an easygoing familiarity, an attraction, for each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4985">He delivers Annie to the Federal Building, and as she gets out she tells him she’s a prosecutor working an “all-nighter” on a big case and gives Max her card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4986">He picks up another fare, Vincent, who hires him for the night to make the five stops to get “signatures” on a real estate deal he’s closing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4987">So far, it’s just another night in L.A.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4988">As Vincent and Max banter about the state of L.A., they get to know each other a little more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4989">They make stop number one, and Max is waiting in the alley behind the building when suddenly there’s a loud crash and a dead body plunges onto the front windshield. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4990">Shocked, stunned, disbelieving, Max is astonished to learn that Vincent killed the man, though the hit man claims “it was the bullet and the fall that killed him.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4991">That’s Plot Point I, the key incident of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4992">This is the incident that sets in motion the entire screenplay, because Max is now forced against his will to drive Vincent to his other “appointments.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4993">He’s virtually a prisoner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4994">Now, the true story begins.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4995">Two physical actions are going on in this story: (1), Max trying to escape from Vincent as they roam through the city; and (2), Vincent doing his job and honoring his contracts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4996">As they make their appointed rounds, we watch Max reacting to the physical action by going through an emotional change that, step by step, leads to his transformation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4997">In the beginning, he’s passive and weak, a wimp, afraid to stand up to his boss at the cab company. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4998">Then he begins to gain a little courage and tries to escape, but winds up watching helplessly as Vincent kills two guys trying to rip off his briefcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4999">They make a “random” visit to a nightclub, ostensibly to listen to some good jazz, but in fact it’s a cover for Vincent to score his next hit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5000">This is a nice touch, setting us up to expect one thing, then turning it around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5001">Then Max is made to visit his mother at the hospital, and once again tries to escape by running away with Vincent’s briefcase and, in defiance, tossing it onto the freeway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5002">His attitude, his strength, is beginning to emerge; he’s starting to stand up for himself.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5003">After the briefcase episode Vincent forces Max, as a sort of punishment or test, to pose as him and meet Felix, the crime boss, to get the new information about the last two hits of the night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5004">Max, in a tense and dramatic moment, rustles up his strength, threatens Felix, and manages to walk out of the meeting alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5005">This is another incident where the physical action triggers an emotional response.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5006">The cops, who think Max is the hit man responsible for all these murders, follow him to a nightclub, and there, on a crowded dance floor, there is a violent shoot-out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5007">Max tries to get away, and when he is spotted by a cop who believes in his innocence, he’s hustled off to safety. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5008">When Vincent sees him with the cop, however, the hit man kills the cop and “rescues” Max.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5009">There’s one more hit for Vincent to fulfill. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5010">At this point, two things are left unresolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5011">One, how is Max going to get away from Vincent alive? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5012">And two, how is he going to prevent Vincent’s last hit? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5013">Racing away from the big shoot-out at the nightclub, Vincent says that Max’s dream of starting a limo company is only a dream, a “someday” excursion into a fantasy that will never happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5014">Max, for the first time, realizes that he has been living a dream for twelve years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5015">Now his dream shattered, and knowing he’ll probably be killed by Vincent when this ordeal is over, he decides to give it all up and live for the moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5016">Otherwise, “What’s the point?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5017">It is this insight that gives him the strength to put his foot on the gas for a wild speed run through the streets of L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5018">He loses control of the wheel and crashes the car, hitting a divider. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5019">The car leaps into the air, hits the ground with a tremendous crash, and rolls. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5020">Plot Point II.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5021">Vincent crawls out of the torn and twisted wreckage, and runs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5022">Max manages to crawl out of the overturned taxi, sees a picture of Annie, the woman he met earlier that evening, and realizes that she is the last victim on Vincent’s list. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5023">Which happens to be the reason why Vincent was at the Federal Building in the first place: She was supposed to be his first hit of the night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5024">Max races on foot to warn Annie, and then we go into a chase sequence that ends the film.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5025">These two Plot Points anchor the story in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5026">Plot Point I is the true beginning of the story: the first murder and Max’s realization that Vincent is responsible for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5027">At Plot Point II, he crashes the car and stands up to Vincent, ready to kill him if need be, in order to save Annie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5028">Each Plot Point is geared by both the emotional and physical forces working on the character; the outside events affect the interior, emotional life of the character and move the script to its next level of action.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5473">What makes Bogart so memorable in this film? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5474">I think it’s a combination of two things: his screen persona and the part itself, which morphs into Bogart’s mythological stature. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5475">In their screenplay, Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch have fashioned a character who is tough and fearless and possessed of a strong moral center and the proverbial heart of gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5476">He’s one of the “good guys,” and his action at the end of the film, letting Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) escape to Lisbon to continue their fight against the Germans, serves a much higher purpose than would his and Ilsa’s personal love affair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5477">“I’m no good at being noble,” he tells Ilsa, “but it doesn’t take much to see that the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.”</span></p>

		<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6157">And then we’re into the aftermath. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6158">Wow! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6159">A virtual assault of words—explosive, fast, visually dynamic, and emotionally insightful; the dialogue is crisp, sharp, and carries us like lightning across the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6160">More than anything, it’s an epiphany for Max. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6161">It’s a grabber, in more ways than one.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6162">The scene starts in the aftermath of the shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6163">It begins surrounded in tension, like an echo of the chaotic shoot-out that preceded it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6164">The strain inside the cab gradually picks up as the car increases speed and Max and Vincent go after each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6165">Max’s choices are few if he hopes to walk away from this nightmare alive.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6166">First, not only is it exciting, filled with friction and suspense, but it illustrates the true purpose of a scene: It </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6167">moves the story forward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6168"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6169">revealing information about the main character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6170">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6171">It does this both physically and emotionally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6172">During the scene, as Max and Vincent race toward downtown, layer after layer of character is stripped away to reveal their personal histories and divergent points of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6173">According to Vincent, we are insignificant here, a tiny speck in the galactic expanse of space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6174">Basically, life is meaningless, with no design, no purpose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6175">The scene is the Plot Point at the end of Act II and leads us into Act III, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6176">Resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6177">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6178">After the car crashes, the only question that remains is simple: Can Max walk away alive, and can he stop Vincent from fulfilling his fifth hit, who, he now learns, is Annie?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6179">The scene </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6180">reveals character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6181">, as Vincent probes and bursts Max’s dream balloon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6182">Up until now, as Vincent says, Max has lived in a dream, in a “someday” state; someday he’s going to fulfill his dream of starting Island Limousine; someday he’s going to meet the woman of his dreams; someday he’ll have it all and be fulfilled as a person. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6183">It’s a pretty big Someday. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6184">Vincent shows him that there is only now, today, this present moment, this point in time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6185">Waiting for “someday” is, like striving for perfection, really just an excuse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6186">“Someday” is a concept that, to quote my mentor, Jean Renoir, “exists only in the mind, not in reality.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6187">What forces are working on these two characters as they engage in their personal duel? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6188">In the nightclub, the hit man, against all odds, has completed his fourth hit, and now Max is driving him toward number five. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6189">Once again, Max is virtually a prisoner, his choices few; either he finds some way to escape safely, Vincent kills him after the final hit is completed, or he manages to kill Vincent.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6190">You’ll notice that this scene is not a simply just another dialogue scene; Max and Vincent are in a speeding taxi, escaping from the frenetic shoot-out at the Korean nightclub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6191">So there is an outside, external tension—the police, other cars, helicopters, traffic lights—that impedes their action and becomes a source of conflict, adding tension to the harsh verbal exchange between Max and Vincent.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6192">There’s another thing that’s revealed in this scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6193">In the beginning, Max was portrayed as something of a wimp, a man afraid to stand up to his boss, the cab dispatcher, a man who lives a “someday” dream pictured in a postcard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6194">But he has been transformed, and finally stands up to and confronts his nemesis.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6195">This does not happen spontaneously but has been gradually built up to, step by step, from the beginning of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6196">It is Vincent who stands up to the dispatcher when he gives Max a bad time, and shows Max how to defend himself against his superior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6197">Max gathers enough strength to throw Vincent’s briefcase onto the freeway, ruining it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6198">Then he’s forced to confront the drug warlord, Felix, and walks out alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6199">Though some might say that these elements are too unbelievable to be taken seriously, to my mind, they work effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6200">Now, prompted by Vincent’s prodding, Max has found enough courage to flip the cab, possibly killing himself and Vincent but at least stopping Vincent from completing his last hit of the evening.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6201">In short, this scene, set amid the fury and confusion of the speeding cab, allows us to watch Max’s transformation and ultimately leads to the conclusion of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6202">Max has completed his character arc.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6203">It’s a marvelous scene.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6204">Do these same principles work with comedy? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6205">Comedy creates a situation, then lets people act and react to the situation and each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6206">In comedy, you can’t have your characters playing for laughs; they have to believe what they’re doing, otherwise it becomes forced and contrived, and therefore unfunny.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6207">Remember the scene at the outdoor restaurant in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6208">Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6209">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6210">Annie (Diane Keaton) tells Alvy (Woody Allen) that she just wants to be his “friend” and not continue their romantic relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6211">Both are uncomfortable, and this adds tension to the scene by heightening the comedic overtones; when he leaves the restaurant he collides with several cars, then tears up his driver’s license in front of a policeman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6212">Woody Allen utilizes the situation for maximum dramatic effectiveness.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6213">In the Italian film </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6214">Divorce—Italian Style</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6215">, a classic comedy with Marcello Mastroianni, only a thin line separates comedy from tragedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6216">But, after all, comedy and tragedy are two sides of the same coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6217">Mastroianni is married to a woman who makes enormous sexual demands on him, and he can’t cope with it—especially when he meets a voluptuous young cousin who’s crazy about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6218">He wants a divorce but, alas, the Church won’t recognize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6219">What’s an Italian man to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6220">The only way the Church will recognize the end of his marriage is for his wife to die. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6221">But she’s as healthy as a horse.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6222">So he decides to kill her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6223">But under Italian law, the only way he can kill her with honor and get away with it is if she’s unfaithful; he has to be cuckolded. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6224">So he sets out to find a lover for his wife.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6225">That’s the situation!</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6226">After many, many funny moments, she </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6227">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6228"> unfaithful to him, and his Italian honor demands he take action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6229">He tracks her and her lover to an island in the Aegean Sea and searches for them, gun in hand.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6230">The characters are caught within the web of circumstances and play their roles with exaggerated seriousness, and the result is film comedy at its best. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6231">For in comedy, Woody Allen says, “Acting funny is the worst thing you can do.”</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6553">What’s nice about designing a sequence is that you can play with many different elements to make it catchy, exciting, dynamic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6554">One of the things I like the most about Sam Peckinpah as a filmmaker is the way he designs his sequences in what I call “the contradiction of image.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6555">Things we don’t expect begin to play upon and affect the central core of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6556">One of my favorite examples is the opening sequence of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6557">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6558">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6559">It can be described simply: a holdup, or bank robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6560">That’s the context.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6561">The script opens with the outlaws, led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), wearing soldier uniforms and riding into a small town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6562">They pass a group of kids setting fire to a scorpion, a little visual aside about what’s to come.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6563">When the Wild Bunch rides into town, they pass a preacher standing underneath a tent, denouncing the evils of alcohol in an abbreviated Leviticus 10:9: “Do not drink wine or strong drink…least ye die…it biteth itself like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6564">In almost every Peckinpah film, there is some kind of reference to the evils of alcohol. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6565">But of course, he never just throws in a scene like this; he includes it as an integral part of the action that erupts once the Temperance Parade begins.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6566">The stage description sets up Pike’s character immediately.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6567">Pike is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6568">thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing—except the changes in himself and those around him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6569">Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero—his values are not ours—he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank robber, a killer of men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6570">His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys and telegraphs or better schools. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6571">He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6572">….</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6573">Pike’s character reveals his sympathetic side immediately; as the group prepares to enter the bank, he inadvertently bumps into a little old lady and knocks her parcels to the ground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6574">Everybody freezes, but with the decorum of a gentleman, Pike picks up the packages, extends his arm, and helps the lady across the street.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6575">The bank robbery does more than just set us up for an action sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6576">Peckinpah sets up his characters and situations in order to illustrate his theme, which is “unchanged men in a changing land.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6577">The relationship between the two main characters, Pike and Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), is established immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6578">In the first scene we see they’ve ridden together, stood by each other, and fought each other; they have a history between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6579">They know that the days of robbing banks and railroads are “closing fast,” and they’re locked into a dead-end future where the only alternatives are death, prison, or living out a meager kind of existence in a small Mexican village.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6580">There are three separate elements in the opening sequence: the holdup, the Temperance Parade, and the scavenger bounty hunters waiting to ambush the Wild Bunch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6581">On a roof across from the bank, the bounty hunters, led by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), have been waiting hours for the Wild Bunch to arrive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6582">The sun is boiling and they’re hot and tired and ornery, but there are large rewards for the capture or killing of the Wild Bunch.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6583">All these elements are set up and established as the holdup begins to unfold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6584">It’s only a matter of time before it all explodes into one kaleidoscopic action sequence.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6585">Integrating these different elements into an action sequence is what places Peckinpah head and shoulders above most other action directors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6586">Inside the bank, Angel, one of the Bunch, notices sunlight on the roof reflecting off rifle barrels across the street. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6587">Pike and Dutch immediately know it’s an ambush, and using the Temperance Parade as a cover they make their break, joining the elderly marchers and children and band members. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6588">That’s when all hell breaks loose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6589">The street becomes a confused melee as bandits run for their horses, bounty hunters open fire, and men, women, and children collide with each other, caught in the crossfire.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6590">It’s an extraordinary sequence that utilizes all the visual components to capture our attention and keep us glued to the edge of our seats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6591">Sometimes, if a script does not seem to be working as well as it should, or you feel there’s a problem in terms of pacing, or things seem dull and boring, you might think about adding some kind of action sequence to keep the story moving and the tension taut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6592">Sometimes you have to make some drastic creative choices to pump up the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6593">If you do, you need to examine the material and see whether the proposed action will blend in with your original concept. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6594">The material has to be designed for and incorporated into your story line, then executed to the best of your ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6595">Often the easy way out—a car chase, or a kiss, or a shoot-out, or a murder attempt—draws attention to itself and therefore doesn’t work.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6730">It’s very good writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6731">Sometimes writers will try to cover a weakness in character writing by inserting action sequences, thus avoiding having to characterize. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6732">Sometimes action sequences are written in such detail that any attempt to create a good reading experience is simply lost in the blanket of excess verbiage.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6733">Other times you may want to weave a narrative line through a sequence that illuminates the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6734">An excellent example is the “selling the house” sequence in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6735">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6736">, in which Carolyn sets out to sell the house she is showing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6737">What’s great about the sequence is that it has one single line of narrative action, selling the house, shown through a series of attempts, each driving the action of the sequence forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6738">Notice the conflict within the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6739">As said many times before, all drama is conflict; without conflict you have no action; without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6740">And without story, you have no screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6741">The sequence begins with Carolyn’s planting a “For Sale” sign on the front lawn in a middle-class neighborhood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6742">As she unloads her car, she frowns and slams the trunk shut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6743">Inside the house, she unzips to her slip and fiercely starts cleaning, repeating the mantra: “I will sell this house today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6744">I will sell this house today….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6745">She scrubs countertops in the kitchen, strides a stepladder to dust a ceiling fan, cleans glass doors overlooking the backyard pool area, vacuums the carpet, doing whatever needs to be done.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6746">That’s the beginning of the sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6747">The middle starts as she swings open the front door with a glorious smile welcoming the first visitors of the day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6748">“Welcome,” she says, “I’m Carolyn Burnham.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6749">She shows a grim-faced couple the fireplace, leads another unsmiling couple into the kitchen, shows a different couple the bedroom, then shows two mannish women in their thirties the outdoor pool area. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6750">“The ad said this pool was ‘lagoon-like.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6751">There’s nothing ‘lagoon-like’ about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6752">Except for maybe the bugs,” one of the women says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6753">“There’s not even any plants out here.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6754">“I have an excellent landscape architect,” Carolyn replies, but the women aren’t even listening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6755">“I mean, I think ‘lagoon,’ and I think waterfall, I think tropical,” the second woman comments sarcastically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6756">“This is just a cement hole.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6757">To which Carolyn responds, smiling, “I have some tiki torches in the garage.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6758">Notice how the one line of action, showing the house, from living room to kitchen to bedroom to the outside, is a continuous line of action, but illustrated with four different couples, giving the impression that Carolyn has been showing the house the whole day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6759">This single line of action, showing the house, is the subject of the sequence, the context; and the content changes from room to room, couple to couple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6760">In effect, this could be labeled a “montage,” a series of shots strung together to bridge time, place, and action.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6761">The sequence concludes with Carolyn, at the end of the day, shutting the vertical blinds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6762">Then, “standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6763">Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6764">‘Stop it,’ she demands to herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6765">But the tears continue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6766">She SLAPS herself again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6767">‘Weak. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6768">Baby. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6769">Shut up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6770">Shut up!’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6771">She SLAPS herself repeatedly until the crying stops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6772">She stands there, taking deep, even breaths until she has everything under control. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6773">Then she finishes pulling the blinds shut, once again all business. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6774">She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6775">Look what we know about her character from this particular sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6776">She fails in her intention, “I will sell this house today”; we’ve seen her working her butt off doing the best job she can, but it’s still not good enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6777">She thinks she has failed, and failure, to her, is a sign of weakness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6778">Then she pulls it all together, wipes the tears away, and strides out as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6779">But look at what we, the reader and audience, get to see: a woman with a low sense of self-esteem and little self-love, who takes failure personally and blames herself for what she is not able to accomplish.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6780">It’s brilliant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6781">And it all comes from a sequence: a series of scenes connected by one single idea, with a definite beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6782">Action and character, joined together, sharpens the focus of your screenplay and makes it both a better reading and a better viewing experience.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6783">The sequence is a major building block in laying out the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6784">The next step is building your screenplay.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6989">I suggest using fourteen cards per approximately thirty pages of screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6990">That means fourteen cards for Act I, fourteen cards for the First Half of Act II, fourteen cards for the Second Half of Act II, and fourteen cards for Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6991">Why fourteen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6992">Because it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6993">Over the years, teaching thousands of students, both here and abroad, I have found I can tell whether a writer has too much material for Act I based on how many cards he/she lays out—strange, but true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6994">If a writer has fifteen or sixteen cards, I can tell immediately that it’s top-heavy; there’s too much material for the act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6995">If there are twelve or thirteen cards, I can tell the material is thin, and the writer needs a few more scenes to flesh it out in terms of character and plot, depth and dimension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6996">Sometimes writers will use eleven or twelve cards and then tell me that they’ll add a few more scenes when they’re writing the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6997">Sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn’t.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6998">It’s just one of those odd things I’ve discovered out of my experience of teaching and writing screenplays; the cards really become a sort of “psychic” guide to laying out the scenes and sequences you’ll need to build your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6999">Sometimes I’ll use different-colored cards: blue for Act I, green for Act II, and yellow for Act III.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7000">The cards are an incredible method. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7001">You have absolute freedom to change, add, or delete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7002">You can arrange or rearrange them, any way you want, adding some, omitting others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7003">It is simple, easy, and effective and gives you maximum mobility in building your screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7004">Sometimes people want to write down their scenes in outline form on the computer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7005">You know: 1, 2, 3, 4…This does work, but I personally find it very restricting; it’s too hard to move scenes around or rearrange them in a different order if you get a sudden idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7006">Final Draft screenwriting software, in versions 6 and 7, has created a scene card application that lets you write down a card, then rearrange it any way you want. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7007">However, I still like the feel of shuffling the cards around; I find it easier to have the cards in my hands so I can arrange and rearrange them at will. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7008">But do whatever works for you.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7009">When you first lay down your story line, I suggest you simply write down all those scenes you know you want included in the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7010">(There’s more about this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7011">The Screenwriter’s Workbook.)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7012"> Just scribble a few words that will identify the scene and throw them down in no real order, free-association style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7013">You already know your beginning and Plot Point I: Cards 1 and 14. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7014">That means you already have two cards, the beginning point and the end point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7015">All you need are twelve more to lay out the action line of Act I.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7175">Sometimes a problem exists because the story line is too thin, and more plot has to be found, but the solution is not creating more characters or interesting incidents to put into the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7176">Creating more events, or more obstacles to confront, is not the answer; it doesn’t do anything except expand the problem.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7177">The trouble is often traceable to a writer’s impulse to get the script off to a fast and provocative start. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7178">If you’ve only got ten pages to grab the attention of the reader or audience, then the tendency is to lump all of the characters, their obstacles, and their relationships with other characters into this ten-page unit of dramatic action.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7229">That’s a lot of information to present in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7230">But it’s been set up in both narration and pictures, so we see that the father’s widow and his three daughters are literally without a roof over their heads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7231">The rest of Act I deals with how the family is going to cope with this situation, and we see them play it out in scene after scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7232">The girls have to be married, of course, for in those days women needed husbands to take care of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7233">When a possible match between Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Edward (Hugh Grant) doesn’t happen, the girls give up the house to their brother and move to the country. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7234">Plot Point I.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7235">If all this backstory information had been executed through dialogue, there would have been way too much explanation in the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7236">It would have been too wordy, the characters passive and reactive, the scenes too long and expository, with the result that the narrative action would not move the story forward.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7237">Build the story line in units of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7238">Start with Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7239">As a complete unit of dramatic action, the story begins with the opening scene or sequence and ends at the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7240">Let’s create a story about Colin, who is falsely accused of embezzling more than a million dollars from his Wall Street company through an ingenious computer scam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7241">During the screenplay, he seeks and finds the true culprit and brings him/her to justice.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7338">Is the card system the only way to construct your story?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7339">No. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7340">There are several ways to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7341">Some writers simply list a series of scenes on the computer, numbering them (1) Bill at the office; (2) Bill with John at bar; (3) Bill sees Jane; (4) Bill leaves for party; (5) Bill meets Jane; (6) Bill and Jane like each other, decide to leave together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7342">As mentioned earlier on, I don’t recommend this method, because you have less freedom to arrange and rearrange scenes.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7392">During the first few weeks it became very clear to me that he was extremely talented, that he worked hard, and that he was disciplined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7393">And yes, he had a good idea that would make a good screenplay if executed properly.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7394">And there’s the rub: “executed properly.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7395">He wanted to write a screenplay, but he wanted to write it on his terms; he wanted to do it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7396">his</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7397"> way, not the way it’s done professionally in the industry today.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7398">Because he was a professional newsperson, he was determined to write in the form he knew best and was most comfortable with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7399">He wanted to write it in “news format,” which meant the scene descriptions and commentary would be on the left-hand margin of the page and the visual description and cues on the right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7400">He placed his dialogue on the left-hand margin, the way playwrights do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7401">Obviously, that’s not proper screenplay form; it may be right in the news media, but it’s not in the film industry.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7413">I didn’t hear from him for several days, and then I got a call telling me he’d gotten a new assignment that would take him out of town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7414">During our conversation, I asked how he was doing and if he was having any problems, trying to encourage and support him in any way I could. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7415">He paused, hesitated, stumbled around, and I knew he had perceived the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7416">Screenplays have a specific form, and if you ignore that form, thinking that at some point down the line you’re going to change it into the correct form, it’s not going to serve you or the story, and especially not the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7417">After all, screenplay form is screenplay form, just like rocks are hard and water’s wet.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7418">I didn’t hear from him during the next week, but at the following class session, he showed me his pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7419">I could see he had some doubts and reservations in letting me read the pages, and after I had looked them over, I could see why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7420">There was no narrative line of action; it was episodic, and his visuals were somewhat dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7421">It didn’t work at all, and he knew it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7422">He knew what he wanted to write, he just didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7423">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7424"> to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7425">It was a washout. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7426">Screenplay form had gotten in the way of his ability to tell his story the way he wanted to tell it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7427">That was it for him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7428">He never came back, and to this day I don’t know if he ever completed that screenplay or not.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7429">So, what’s the moral of the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7430">If you want to do it, do it right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7431">He wanted to write a screenplay, but refused to learn the proper form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7432">Screenplay form is unique and precise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7433">It’s so simple it’s difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7434">Why?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7435">Look at some of the common assumptions that are so prevalent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7436">The first and most common is that when you’re writing a screenplay, it is the writer’s responsibility (read: “your” responsibility) to write in the camera instructions so the director and others can see how it should be filmed.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7437">Wrong.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7438">The writer’s job is to write the screenplay and keep the reader turning pages, not to determine how a scene or sequence </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7439">should</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7440"> be filmed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7441">You don’t have to tell the director and cinematographer and film editor how to do their jobs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7442">Your job is to write the screenplay, to give them enough visual information so they can bring those words on the page into life, in full “sound and fury,” revealing strong visual and dramatic action, with clarity, insight, and emotion.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7443">Don’t give the reader an excuse not to read your screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7444">That’s what the screenplay form is all about—what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7445">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7446"> a professional screenplay, and what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7447">isn’t</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7448">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7449">As a reader, I’m always looking for an excuse not to read a script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7450">So when I find a screenplay with improper form, I make a determination: An aspiring writer, a novice, wrote this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7451">The first lesson is simple: You can’t sell a script in Hollywood without the help of readers; don’t give them a reason not to take you seriously.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7452">Everybody, it seems, has his/her own conception about what is, and what is not, screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7453">Some people say if you’re writing a screenplay you’re “obligated” to write in camera angles; and if you ask them why, they’ll mumble something about “so the director knows what to film!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7454">They’ll create an elaborate and meaningless exercise called “writing in camera angles.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7455">And soon, an abundance of camera angles—like long shots, close shots, various instructions about zooms, pans, and dollies—pepper the pages, revealing a novice screenwriter who doesn’t know what he or she is doing.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7456">There was a time, in the 1920s and ’30s, when the director’s only job was to direct the actors, and it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7457">was</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7458"> the writer’s job to write in camera angles for the cameraman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7459">That’s no longer true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7460">It’s not the job of the screenwriter.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8257">Writing is an experiential process, a learning process involving the acquisition of skill and coordination, like riding a bicycle, swimming, dancing, or playing tennis.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8263">For example: When you first sit down to start writing, you may suddenly get the urge to clean the refrigerator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8264">Or to wash the kitchen floor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8265">You may want to go to the gym, change the sheets, take a drive, eat, watch television, take a yoga class, or have sex. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8266">Some people go out and buy a thousand dollars’ worth of clothes they don’t need or want! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8267">You may get angry, impatient, and yell at everybody and anybody for nothing in particular.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8268">They’re all forms of resistance.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8269">One of my favorite forms of resistance is sitting down to write and suddenly getting an idea for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8270">another</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8271"> screenplay—a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8272">much better</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8273"> idea, an idea so unique, so original, so exciting, you wonder what you’re doing writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8274">this</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8275"> screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8276">You really think about it.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8389">Dramatic conflict can be either internal or external; stories like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8390">The Hours, Chinatown, The Manchurian Candidate, A Place in the Sun</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8391"> (Michael Wilson and Harry Brown), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8392">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8393">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8394">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8395"> have both internal and external conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8396">External conflict is where the conflict is outside the characters and they face physical (and of course, emotional) obstacles, such as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8397">Cold Mountain, Collateral, Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8398">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8399">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8400">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8401">Creating conflict within the story, through the characters and events, is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing, whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8402">So what is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8403">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8404">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8405">If you look up the word, you’ll see it involves “opposition”; and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character or characters be in opposition to some</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8406">one</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8407"> or some</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8408">thing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8409">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8410">Conflict can be anything: a struggle, a quarrel, a battle, or a chase scene; fear of life, or fear of failure or success; internal or external—any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8411">Conflict must be at the very hub of your story, because it is the core of strong action and strong character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8412">If you do not have enough conflict, the foundation to your writing, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in a quagmire of dull writing.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8413">Keep writing, day by day, page by page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8414">And during the writing process you’re going to discover things about yourself you never knew. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8415">For example, if you’re writing about something that happened to you, you may reexperience some old feelings and emotions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8416">You may get “wacky” and irritable and live each day as if you were on an emotional roller coaster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8417">Don’t worry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8418">Just keep writing.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8419">You’re going to move through three stages of your first-draft screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8420">The first stage is the “words on paper” stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8421">That’s when you put it all down—everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8422">During this stage, if you’re in doubt about writing a scene or not writing it, write it. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8423">If in doubt, write</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8424">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8425">That’s the rule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8426">If you start censoring yourself, you might wind up with an eighty-page screenplay, and that’s too short. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8427">(Comedies, however, are usually about eighty-five to ninety pages.) You’ll have to add scenes to what is with any luck an already tight structure to fill it out and bring it to length, and that’s extremely difficult to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8428">It’s easier to cut scenes than add them to an already structured screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8429">Keep moving forward in your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8430">If you write a scene and go back to clean it up, polish it, and “make it right,” you’ll find you’ve dried up at about page 60, lost all your creative spark, and you might even shelve the project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8431">Many writers I know who’ve tried to write a draft this way have failed to complete it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8432">Any major changes you need to make, do in the second draft.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8433">There will be moments when you don’t know how to begin a scene, or what to do next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8434">You know what happens on the cards, but not how to get into it visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8435">If this happens, break down the action of your scene into a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8436">What’s the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8437">Where does your character come from? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8438">What is his/her purpose in the scene?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8439">Ask yourself “What happens next?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8440">and you’ll get an answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8441">It’s usually the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8442">first</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8443"> thought skittering across the back of your mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8444">Grab it, and throw it down on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8445">It’s what I call the “creative grab,” because you’ve got to be quick enough to “catch it” and put it down.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8446">Many times you’ll try to improve that first idea to “make it better.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8447">If your first thought is to place the scene in a car driving down the highway, and you decide to make it a walk in the country or a walk on the beach, you’ll lose a certain creative energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8448">Do it too many times and your script will reflect a contrived, deliberate quality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8449">It won’t work.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8450">There’s only one rule that governs your writing—not whether it’s “good” or “bad,” but does it work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8451">Does your scene or sequence work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8452">If it does, keep it in, no matter what anybody says.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8453">If it works, use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8454">If it doesn’t, don’t.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8455">If you don’t know how to get in or out of a scene, free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8456">Let your mind wander; ask yourself the best way to get into the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8457">Trust yourself and you’ll find the answer.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8458">If you created the problem, you’ll be able to find a solution to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8459">All you have to do is look for it.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8460">Problems in a screenplay can always be solved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8461">Just know that if you’ve created the problem, whatever it is, you can solve it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8462">If you get stuck, go back to your characters; go into your character biography and ask him/her what he or she would do in that situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8463">You’ll get an answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8464">It may take a minute, an hour, a day, several days, a week, but you’ll get the answer—probably when you least expect it, and in the most unusual place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8465">Just keep asking yourself the question “What do I need to do to solve this problem?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8466">Run it through your head constantly, especially before you go to sleep. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8467">If I have a problem like this I give myself a dream assignment: “Please reveal the answer to the problem during my dream state.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8468">It can be a very powerful tool. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8469">Give yourself time for the answer to reveal itself to you, but trust in the process.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8470">Writing is the ability to ask yourself questions and get the answers.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8471">Sometimes you’ll get into a scene and not know where you’re going, or what you’re looking for to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8472">You know the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8473">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8474">, not the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8475">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8476">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8477">So you’ll write the same scene five different times, from five different points of view, and out of all these attempts you may find one line that gives you the key to what you’re looking for.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8478">You’ll rewrite the scene using that one line as your anchor thought and eventually be able to create something dynamic and spontaneous. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8479">You just have to find your way.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8480">And trust yourself.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8481">Around page 80 or 90, the resolution is forming and you’ll discover the screenplay is literally writing itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8482">You’re just the medium, putting in time to finish the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8483">You don’t have to do anything; if you let it come through you, it writes itself.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8484">Writing a screenplay is writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8485">There are no shortcuts.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8486">It may take you six to eight weeks to complete your first “words on paper” draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8487">Then you’re ready to move into the second stage of your first draft: taking a cold, hard, objective look at what you’ve written.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8488">This is the most mechanical and uninspiring stage of writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8489">You’ll take what is perhaps a 180- to 200-page draft of your script and reduce it to 130 or 140 pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8490">You’ll cut out some scenes, add new ones, rewrite others, make any changes you need to, to get it into a workable form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8491">It might take you about three weeks to do this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8492">When you’ve finished, you’re ready to approach the third stage of your first-draft script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8493">This is where you see what you’ve got, where the story really gets written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8494">You’ll polish it, accent it, hone and rewrite it, trim it to length, and make it all come to life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8495">You’re out of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8496">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8497"> now, so you can see what you’ve got to do to make it better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8498">In this stage you may rewrite a scene as many as ten times before you get it right.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8499">There will always be one or two scenes that don’t work the way you want them to, no matter how many times you rewrite them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8500">You know these scenes don’t work, but the reader will never know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8501">He/she reads for story and execution, not content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8502">It usually takes me about an hour to read a script, seeing it in my head rather than reading it for prose style or content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8503">Don’t worry about the few scenes you know don’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8504">Let them be.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8516">You have to be ruthless in writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8517">If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8518">If your scenes stand out and draw attention to themselves, they might impede the flow of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8519">Scenes that stand out </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8520">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8521"> work are the scenes that will be remembered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8522">Every good film has one or possibly two scenes that people always remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8523">These scenes work within the dramatic context of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8524">They are also the trademark scenes that later become immediately recognizable.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8529">There may be times during the screenwriting process when you experience a sinking sensation in the pit of your stomach, when suddenly there is a cloud of negativity and confusion sprinkled on the waters of your creativity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8530">And it seems to come out of nowhere.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8531">Most writers, including myself, try to ignore the feeling, to push it away, hide it under the carpet; yet the more we try to dispel it, to pretend it’s not there, to hover behind a false bravado, the more we realize we’re stuck, lost somewhere within a maze of our own creation.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8532">That’s when we hit “the wall.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8533">Almost all writers, at some time or other, experience this wall, or block, and try to force their way through it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8534">Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8535">Most of the time it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8536">And no matter where you are in the screenwriting process, the first “words on paper” draft or the rewrite, it doesn’t take much to be overwhelmed by the writing process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8537">We handle this kind of problem in many different ways, of course, like suddenly finding more “important” things to do, like cleaning the kitchen, going to the market, washing the dishes, or going to the movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8538">Whatever.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8550">If you are writing a story and do not know what emotional forces are working on your character, it is very easy to “run up against the wall” and keep “going around in circles,” ultimately falling into that well known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8551">writer’s block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8552">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8553">Here’s the way it usually works: You’re totally immersed in the day-to-day process of screenwriting, but there may be one scene or sequence that does not work as well as it should, and you might begin to wonder why it’s not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8554">Still, it’s just a random thought and you probably don’t pay much attention to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8555">But you might become aware of a subtle shift occurring within yourself, maybe some doubts about why this scene or sequence is failing to come together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8556">Then you might find that you’re talking to yourself, having a little conversation about “the Problem.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8557">The first thing that usually happens is you start questioning yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8558">“If I weren’t so stupid, I could do this,” you might think, and the more you wrestle with the problem, the more your image as a screenwriter begins to erode, and then you start making disparaging comments about yourself and your ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8559">That’s when you begin sliding into “the pit,” and soon the entire litany of negative judgments descends upon you.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8560">“I knew I should have stayed away from this subject,” you might think, or “I’m no good at writing.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8561">Soon you’ll begin to expand and enlarge on your insecurities, thinking, “I don’t know whether I should be writing this script,” or “Maybe I just don’t have the talent to do this,” or “Maybe I should just find a partner and write it with someone else.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8562">It goes on and on.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8563">But underneath all these thoughts, comments, or judgments you’re making is the common thread that somehow it’s all “your fault.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8564">If you could do it, you would, and if you can’t, it’s because you don’t have the talent or ability to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8565">In short, we turn it inside and blame ourselves.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8566">No wonder it’s called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8567">writer’s block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8568">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8569">If you’re in this dilemma, and this veil of doubt and negativity is smothering your creative voice, then it’s time to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8570">give the critic a voice</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8571">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8572">That means giving that judgmental, critical, and negative voice that’s roaming around inside your head the opportunity to speak his or her mind.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8573">Remember that this is one of those common problems that strike fear in the hearts of screenwriters everywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8574">I recall a screenwriting student coming into class one night with a strange and somewhat tortured look on her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8575">When I asked her what was wrong, her eyes welled up with tears and she became very serious, and said, “I don’t know where I’m going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8576">I’m totally lost, I’m confused, and my pages stink. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8577">All that’s happening is talk, talk, talk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8578">I keep going around in circles, and I don’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8579">I’m so upset I could cry.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8580">It’s a universal problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8581">How you get out of it varies from person to person, script to script, but the first thing to do is to admit </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8582">you have a problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8583"> and that it’s not going to go away until you deal with it, confront it head-on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8584">That’s just one of the truths of life.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8585">In my student’s case she was so close to the material she couldn’t see it anymore, so the first thing I wanted her to do was just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8586">When you reach this kind of crisis point, you’re so overwhelmed and frustrated that you have to regroup. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8587">Just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8588">Put down your pen and paper, shut off your computer or tape recorder, however you’re working, and spend some time contemplating your story: What is the story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8589">What is the dramatic need of your main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8590">How are you going to resolve the story line? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8591">The answers to these questions are the key to getting back on track.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8622">That’s the nature of the mind: to judge, to criticize, to evaluate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8623">The mind can be either our best friend or our worst enemy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8624">It’s so easy to get plugged into our judgments and evaluations of what’s right or wrong, good or bad.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8625">Now, it could be that what the critic says is accurate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8626">Maybe the pages </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8627">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8628"> terrible, the characters </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8629">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8630"> thin and one-dimensional, and you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8631">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8632"> going around in circles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8633">So what? </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8634">Confusion is the first step toward clarity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8635">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8636">What you try that doesn’t work will always show you what does work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8637">As you struggle through your problem area, just get something down on paper; just write lousy pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8638">You’ll always be able to go back and make them better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8639">That’s the process all writers go through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8640">So what if you’ve “hit a wall” and are going around in circles, dazed, lost, and confused.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8641">Give the critic a voice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8642">If you don’t give the critic a voice, it’ll turn inside and begin to fester, getting worse and worse until it bursts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8643">It’s easy to let yourself become your own victim.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8644">Until you become aware of the critic’s voice running around in the back of your mind, you’re going to become a victim of that voice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8645">Recognizing and acknowledging that voice is the first step through the block; it’s not necessary to act upon, or make a decision about, the judgments and evaluations the critic makes, or to determine whether the critic is right or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8646">No matter what stage you are at in the writing process, don’t get too serious about what the critic tells you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8647">One of the things we have to accept is that we always get lost within the maze of our own creations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8648">And we are our own worst critics.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8649">Writer’s block is a powerful enemy and can hammer you into submission; the mere thought of writing will turn you off, and because you’re not writing you’ll feel guilty, so whenever you sit down to write you’ll suddenly feel this blanket of heaviness settle over your head, causing you to lose all objectivity and fall into despair.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8650">Writer’s block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8651">It happens all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8652">To everybody.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8653">The difference is how you deal with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8654">How you see it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8655">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8656">There are two different ways to look at this “problem.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8657">One is to see your dilemma as a real problem, a real block, something to “overcome” or “break through,” a physical and emotional obstacle that is locking you into a creative straitjacket.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8658">That’s one way of looking at it.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8659">But there’s another way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8660">And that is to see the ordeal as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8661">part of the writer’s experience</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8662">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8663">After all, it’s universal, everybody goes through it; it’s nothing new or unusual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8664">If you recognize and acknowledge that, you’ve reached a creative crossroads. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8665">The realization becomes a creative guide to another level of your screenwriting craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8666">If you can look at it as an opportunity, you will find a way to strengthen and broaden your ability to create characters and story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8667">You’ll see that maybe you need to go deeper into your story and strive for another level of richness, full of texture and dimension.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8669">If you understand that being challenged by writer’s block, being dazed, lost, and confused, is only a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8670">symptom</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8671">, this “problem” becomes an opportunity to test yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8672">And isn’t that what life is all about—putting yourself on the line in a situation where you test yourself to rise to another level? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8673">It’s simply an evolutionary step along the path of the screenwriting process.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8674">If you accept this point of view, it means you’re going to have to dig deeper into your material; you’re going to have to stop writing, go back into your character’s life and action, and define and clarify different elements of your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8675">You’re going to have to go back and do new character biographies; to define or redefine the characters and their relationships to each other, which are, after all, the hub of your story line.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8676">If you’re working on a particular scene, for example, you may need to rewrite it, or change the points of view of your characters; you may need to change locations, or create new actions, episodes, or events for your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8677">Sometimes you may have to restructure the action in a particular scene or sequence by restructuring the entire act!</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8683">Let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8684">Just be aware that you’re holding on, then let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8685">One day you’ll write “Fade Out,” or “The End”—and you’ll be done. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8686">It</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8687"> will be done.</span></p>

		<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8719">The story of Seabiscuit is a unique and inspirational one, not only for what the horse accomplished but for the way in which he accomplished it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8720">During the second half of the 1930s, Seabiscuit became a cultural icon throughout the length and breath of the land. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8721">He was universally praised, his exploits and appeal so legendary that the very name “Seabiscuit” seemed to transcend the sport itself.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8722">But this was more than just a story of a physically and spiritually broken horse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8723">With his extraordinary rise to fame, he became a symbol of hope; here was a story of three men and a horse striving for some kind of belief and faith to hold on to in the midst of the Great Depression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8724">Seabiscuit became the object of the nation’s faith, someone to root for, something we could believe in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8725">As a horse, he was not much to look at—he was small and had short legs—but he was blessed with an indomitable will that remained intact even after he spent two entire seasons floundering in the lowest ranks of horse racing.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8726">That all changed when the horse came under the forcefully gentle and patient leadership of Tom Smith, a man who personified the freedom of the frontier and preferred the company of horses to that of men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8727">Red Pollard, Seabiscuit’s jockey, had been abandoned by his parents as a boy, and for years was a failing jockey who barely survived. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8728">Charles Howard was a self-made millionaire who lost the only thing he really loved and lived for, his young son.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8729">Taken together, these three men and a horse were emotionally shattered in their search for unity and wholeness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8730">When they joined together, they fulfilled a need in one another: Charles Howard became the father figure, Tom Smith the teacher, Red Pollard the jockey, the son, the doer; they became a team, a family, sharing their skills to forge the legend known the world over as Seabiscuit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8731">As Red says at the end of the movie: “You know, everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him, but we didn’t….He fixed us. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8732">Every one one of us. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8733">And, I guess in a way, we kind of fixed each other too.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8734">Gary Ross adapted </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8735">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8736"> from a best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand and turned it into an original screenplay based on the life and exploits of the legendary racehorse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8737">As a screenplay adapted from a book, it honored the original source material both in terms of spirit and integrity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8738">It is a moving, inspirational cinematic experience that captures the essence of the legendary horse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8739">When I first read the book I loved it—it was an exciting, informative experience—and I wondered if Gary Ross, the writer-director, would be able to take such broad, sweeping historical events and fuse them into a poignant, gripping story line.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8780">As mentioned earlier, in a novel the dramatic action of the story, the narrative line, is usually told through the eyes of the main character; the reader knows his/her thoughts, feelings, memories, hopes, and fears. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8781">There may be chapters written from other characters’ points of view, but the dramatic action usually occurs inside the main character’s head, within the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8782">mindscape</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8783"> of dramatic action.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8784">The screenplay, of course, is different; it is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8785">a story told with pictures</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8786">, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8787">Film, when you get right down to it, is behavior.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8789">Every screenwriter approaches the craft of adaptation differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8790">Alvin Sargent, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8791">Ordinary People, Spider-Man 2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8792">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8793">Julia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8794">, among other films, reads the source material as many times as it takes to “make it his own,” until it’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8795">his</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8796"> story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8797">Then he writes individual scenes in a random fashion, lays them all together on the floor, and shapes a story line out of those individual scenes.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8798">Ted Tally, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8799">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8800"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8801">The Juror</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8802">, says he “breaks down the book scene by scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8803">I try to establish the structural line of events; this event happens, then this event, then this and this happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8804">What’s important from the book is what sticks in your mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8805">So I put those scenes on cards, one by one, just getting the story down, concentrating on the main needs of the adaptation.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8806">The first thing Tally does is determine who the story is about, and anything that does not serve the main character needs to be cut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8807">When you’re adapting a book that may be 350 or more pages into a screenplay that’s only 120 pages, you have to be ruthless, yet maintain the integrity of the source material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8808">Which is what Gary Ross did in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8809">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8810">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8811">Not only did he have to capture the tone and temper of the times, but he wove action that occurred over many years into a two-hour-plus movie, yet still remained true to the source material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8812">And within the historical context of the times, he had to set up the lives of three men, as well as that of Seabiscuit, then structure their journey as they overcame obstacle after obstacle to achieve their success on both a personal and professional level.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8813">It’s a general rule that if you’re adapting a book or an article to fit the needs of a screenplay, you may have to shift, omit, or add scenes in order to follow the main story line.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8814">“The last thing you’re concerned with,” Tally says, “is invention for its own sake. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8815">If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8816">Meaning that if scenes work within the context of the screenplay, don’t change them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8817">If you can’t use scenes in the book, you may have to create new ones to make the film work on a visual level, not a literary one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8818">Remember that when you’re deliberately breaking a book apart in order to make it into a screenplay, you’re going to have to invent new scenes, or invent a way to meld two or three scenes from the novel into one scene in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8819">And that means you’re going to have to invent transitions to keep the action moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8820">And then you’re going to have to invent dialogue for those transitions because you’ve sacrificed so much information, the story could be confusing.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8821">“You can’t be a slave to the book,” Tally continues. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8822">What he means is that you want the narrative flow in your head, but you don’t want it oppressing you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8823">Often during the writing process you’ll reference your own story outline more than the novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8824">And once you complete your first draft, you’ll have no reference to the published novel at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8825">The screenplay becomes only about itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8826">An adaptation starts to develop its own logic and meaning once you’re writing the screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8827">The hub of adaptation is finding a balance between the characters and the situation, yet keeping the integrity of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8828">If you want to see a great adaptation, read </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8829">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8830">, then watch the movie, and notice the skill with which Gary Ross captured the integrity and inspiration of the source material.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8845">“Part of the trick of adaptation is trying to find a workable way of externalizing the book’s interior monologues. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8846">Sometimes it came down to taking the thoughts and turning them into dialogue.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8847">This is one of the common challenges writers have when they approach an adaptation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8848">I talked with Stuart Beattie, the gifted young writer of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8849">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8850">, after he had just completed adapting a novel into a screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8851">I asked how he approached the adaptation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8852">The film, adapted from the novel </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8853">Derailed</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8854"> by James Siegel, is “a thriller novel,” he began, “about an ordinary guy who has an affair and his wife gets incredibly derailed as a result of this one moment of weakness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8855">So, there’s a morality aspect to it, very much a Hitchcockian kind of everyday man who is put into an extraordinary circumstance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8856">The character keeps trying to get out of it, but just gets deeper and deeper into the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8857">“When I first read the book I was literally on the edge of my seat,” he continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8858">“It was a four-hundred-page book and about three hundred pages into it I knew it would make a great film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8859">Then this incredible hundred-eighty-degree plot twist occurs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8860">You know, it’s one of those ‘don’t do’ rules of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8861">You just ‘don’t do’ things like putting in an unexpected plot twist at the end.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8862">“Even though I had to get rid of the last third of the book,” he said, “the drama is in the family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8863">The girl has type one diabetes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8864">The mother and father are saving up for this new drug that’s coming out which would basically save her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8865">She has a dialysis machine every night that’s strung out in the second mortgage payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8866">They’re all in stress. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8867">Not connecting anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8868">Wrapped up in the pain of the dilemma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8869">That kind of hellhole. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8870">So it sets up the situation of him walking out of the marriage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8871">That’s basically the set-up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8872">It starts out like it’s going to be a family drama, then twists around violently at the end of the Act I, then twists around again and again.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8873">I asked how many times he read the material before he began writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8874">“Two or three times,” he told me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8875">“The first time through is the most important, because that’s the time you’re getting it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8876">I’ll write ‘good scene, good line, good moment, or something like this could be an opening scene,’ that kind of stuff, not knowing where everything’s going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8877">Then you’ve got to let it go and make the movie out of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8878">And then, a few weeks before shooting, we go back to the book and see if there’s anything that’s been dropped along the way: a line, a moment, something like that.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8879">“I don’t do a very detailed outline after I read the book two or three times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8880">I do a beat sheet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8881">Around a two- or three-page beat sheet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8882">Like, ‘the scene in the car, the scene in the elevator, the scene in the house, the scene at the doctor’s, and so on.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8883">In a screenplay, I’ll normally do a ten-page outline. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8884">And usually I try to get that down to a five-page outline. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-8885">Getting it down to five pages, I’ve got Act I on page one, Act III on page five…that just works for me.”</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9321">When I asked what he meant by that, he replied that in his definition true “art” is the sole vision of one person, which in the scheme of the filmmaking process is not at all the case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9322">He explained that one person can’t do everything required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9323">One person can write the screenplay, direct the film, star in it, photograph it, edit it, and score it, like Charlie Chaplin did, but, Renoir stated, the filmmaker cannot act all the parts, or record all the sound, or handle all the lighting requirements along with the vast myriad of other technical details required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9324">He can shoot the film but he can’t develop it; he has to send it to a special film laboratory for that, and sometimes it doesn’t come back the way he wants it, or sees it in his artistic vision.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9325">Because of his background and tradition, Renoir felt that film, though a great art, was never really a “true” art in the sense that writing, painting, or music is a “true” art, because too many people are directly involved in its making and outcome.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9326">“Art,” Renoir stated, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9327">One person can’t do everything….True art is in the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9328">doing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9329"> of it.”</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9364">There’s always a dynamic interchange between science, art, and technology in the evolution of the movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9365">If we believe in the future of cinema, we’re all like Jay Gatsby, chasing the “green light” that beckons us to the future.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9366">If we listen to the wisdom of Renoir, the only thing we can do by ourselves is write a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9367">You don’t need very much: a computer, pen and paper, or a typewriter and a certain amount of time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9368">Sometimes you may want to write alone, by yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9369">But there are other times when you wish you could join forces with someone and write a screenplay together, meaning </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9370">collaborate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9371"> with someone.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9372">It’s a choice you make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9373">It has both an upside and a downside.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9374">The upside of writing alone is obvious: There will be no one interfering with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9375">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9376"> you want to write and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9377">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9378"> you want to write it and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9379">when</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9380"> you want to write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9381">In other words, it is your vision and yours alone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9382">There’s no one else getting in the way—at least at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9383">There’s a lot to be said for that.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9384">The downside of doing it on your own is also obvious: You’re alone in a room staring at the blank page or an empty computer screen, and there are moments when you don’t know what happens next, or what you want to say or how you want to say it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9385">Sometimes, maybe a lot of the time, the dialogue sounds corny, contrived, and predictable; if it’s not happening the way you see it in your mind, the tendency is to turn your frustration, depression, and anger onto yourself and berate yourself for doing such a poor job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9386">So you think the writing sucks, that you can’t do it, that it’s just not working, that you’re not good enough, that you don’t have the talent to do it, that the story is trite and banal, and who do you think you’re kidding anyway?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9387">You know the drill.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9388">Many times writers choose to join forces just to avoid those negative feelings and that uncertainty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9389">Other times, necessity dictates collaboration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9390">For </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9391">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9392">, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens collaborated because “the writing part was related to how much time I had,” Peter Jackson said in an interview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9393">“In the beginning, before we started shooting, we very much wrote the scripts together—we would sit in the same room and write scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9394">I’d sit at the computer and type it in because I find, as the person who’s ultimately going to direct the film, that if I write the descriptive passages, it’s my first opportunity to imagine the film in my head. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9395">Fran works in longhand and writes the dialogue of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9396">Philippa does the same thing, but on her laptop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9397">Then I sit down, take the dialogue, and write the descriptive passages around the dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9398">I’m thinking as a director, not as a screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9399">Once I move into shooting, we’re revising the script as the film is being shot, but I can participate much less in the actual physical writing process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9400">It becomes Philippa and Fran, and I react to them, or just say, ‘Yep, perfect.’ </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9401">My collaboration as a member of the writing team becomes one much more based on feedback and suggesting ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9402">Having said that, we did spend a lot of weekends working on script stuff, all the way through the shoot.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9403">Sometimes a producer or production company has an idea and commissions you to develop it into a screenplay, and then you’re in collaboration with the producer and director. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9404">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9405">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9406">, for example, Lawrence Kasdan (with only one screenwriting credit at the time, a rewrite of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9407">The Empire Strikes Back</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9408">) met with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9409">Lucas wanted to use the name of his dog, Indiana Jones, for the hero (Harrison Ford). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9410">The other thing he knew was that the last scene of the movie would be set in a vast military basement warehouse filled with thousands of crates of confiscated secrets, much as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9411">Citizen Kane</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9412">’s basement was filled with huge crates of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9413">That’s all Lucas knew about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9414">Raiders</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9415"> at the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9416">Spielberg wanted to add a mystical dimension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9417">The three men spent two weeks locked in an office, and when they emerged, they had worked out a general story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9418">Then Lucas and Spielberg left to work on other projects, and Kasdan went into his office and wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9419">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9420">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9421">Writers collaborate for different reasons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9422">There are times, at least on some projects, when screenwriters think it’s easier to work with someone else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9423">Most television writers work in teams, and shows like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9424">Saturday Night Live, Desperate Housewives</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9425">, or the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9426">CSI: Miami</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9427"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9428">CSI: New York</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9429"> shows have a staff of anywhere from five to ten writers working on each episode. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9430">A comedy writer has to be both gagman and audience—a laugh is a laugh. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9431">Only the gifted few like Woody Allen or Neil Simon can sit in a room alone and know what’s funny and what isn’t.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9432">When you decide to collaborate on a screenplay with someone, it’s important to distinguish the three stages of the collaborative process: (1), establishing the ground rules of the collaboration; (2), the preparation required to write the material; and (3), the actual writing itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9433">All three stages are essential. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9434">If you decide to collaborate, you’d better go into it with your eyes open. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9435">For example, do you like your potential collaborator? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9436">You’re going to be working with that person for several hours a day for several months, so you better enjoy being with him or her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9437">Otherwise, you’re starting off with problems.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9438">Collaboration is a relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9439">It’s a fifty-fifty proposition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9440">Two or more people are joining together </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9441">to create an end product</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9442">, a screenplay or television show or whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9443">That’s the aim, goal, and purpose of your collaboration, and that’s where all your energy should be directed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9444">Collaborators tend to lose sight of that very quickly.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9445">Sometimes we get bogged down in “being right” and in the process engage in various ego struggles, so it’s best you ask yourself some questions before you begin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9446">For example, why are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9447">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9448"> collaborating? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9449">Why is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9450">your partner</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9451"> collaborating? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9452">What’s the reason you’re choosing to work with somebody else? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9453">Because it’s easier? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9454">Safer? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9455">Not as lonely? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9456">Out of insecurity?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9457">What do you think collaborating with someone looks like? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9458">That is, what kind of mental picture do you have of the collaboration? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9459">Most people have a picture of one person sitting at a desk in front of a computer or typewriter, typing like crazy, while his or her partner paces the room rapidly, snapping out words and phrases like a party planner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9460">You know, a “writing team.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9461">A talker and a typist.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9462">Is that the way you see it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9463">It may have been that way at one time, during the ’20s and ’30s when writing teams like Moss Hart and George S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9464">Kaufman were turning out plays and movies, but it’s not that way anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9465">Rather, it may be some kind of variation on what Peter Jackson did with his cowriters on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9466">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9467">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9468">Everyone works differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9469">We each have our own style, our own pace, our own likes and dislikes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9470">One of the best examples of what I think represents an ideal collaboration was the musical collaboration between Elton John and Bernie Taupin back in the ’70s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9471">At the height of their musical fame, Bernie Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then fax them to Elton John, wherever he was around the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and finally record it.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9730">For example, some married friends of mine, both professional journalists, decided to write a screenplay together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9731">She was in between assignments and he was in the middle of one, both for major magazines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9732">She had time on her hands, so she decided to get a head start and began to research the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9733">She went to the library, read books, interviewed people, then entered the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9734">She didn’t mind, figuring “</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9735">someone’s</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9736"> got to do it!”</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9749">That’s how it began. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9750">It got worse. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9751">They hadn’t talked about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9752">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9753"> they were going to work together, only that they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9754">would</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9755">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9756">No ground rules had been established, no decisions made about who did what or when, and no work schedule had been set up.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9757">As a writer, she works in the morning and writes very fast, throwing words down quickly with lots of blank spaces, then goes back and rewrites the material three or four times until she feels it’s right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9758">He, on the other hand, works best at night, writing slowly, crafting each word and phrase with delicate precision; his first draft is almost a final one.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9759">They are both professional writers, but when they made the decision to collaborate and actually began working together, they had no idea about what to expect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9760">She had collaborated only once before, and he had never worked with another writer in this kind of situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9761">They both had expectations about what the other would do, but they didn’t communicate them to each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9762">After all, in a marriage, sometimes we take things for granted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9763">And the cost, of course, is high.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9764">They adjusted their mind-sets, and after they had laid out the story, they established their schedule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9765">It was decided that she would write the first act—which was the material she had researched—and he would write Act II.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9766">So, she got down to work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9767">She was a little insecure, she told me—after all, it was her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9768">first</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9769"> screenplay—and she worked hard to overcome the resistance of the form that she soon encountered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9770">She wrote the first ten pages and then, looking for some feedback, asked her husband to read them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9771">She didn’t know if she was on the right track or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9772">Was she setting up the story correctly? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9773">Was it what they had discussed and talked about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9774">Were the characters real people in real situations? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9775">Her concern was only natural.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9779">He took the pages, then put them aside and went back to work, saying nothing to his wife. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9780">She gave him a few days to read the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9781">When he didn’t, she became angry, so he promised he would read it that night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9782">That satisfied her, at least for the moment.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9783">She got up early the next morning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9784">He was still sleeping, having worked late the night before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9785">She made coffee and tried to work for a while. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9786">But it was no use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9787">She wanted to know what her husband, her “collaborator,” thought about the pages she had written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9788">What was taking him so long?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9789">The more she thought about it, the more impatient she became. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9790">She had to know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9791">Finally, she made a decision; what he didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9792">Quietly she crept into his office and softly closed the door behind her.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9793">She went to his desk and started riffling through his papers to see what comments, if any, he had made on her first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9794">She finally found them, but there was nothing on them—no marks, no comments, no nothing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9795">He hadn’t even read them! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9796">Angry, she started to read his pages to see what he was so hung up about.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9797">That’s when she heard the noise on the stairs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9798">As she turned around the door was suddenly flung open and her husband stood framed in the doorway, yelling, “Get away from that desk!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9799">She tried to explain, but he didn’t listen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9800">He accused her of spying, of meddling, of invading his privacy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9801">She erupted, and all the anger and tension and withheld communication came pouring out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9802">They went at it, fighting tooth and nail, no holds barred. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9803">It </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9804">all</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9805"> came out: resentment, frustration, fear, anxiety, insecurity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9806">It was a screaming match; even the dog started barking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9807">At the peak of their “collaboration” he picked her up bodily, dragged her across the floor, and literally threw her out of the office, slamming the door in her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9808">She took off her shoe and stood there pounding on the door. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9809">To this day, her heel marks are etched into his office door.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9813">They learned a great deal from the experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9814">They learned that fighting doesn’t work in collaboration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9815">They learned to work together and communicate on a more personal and professional level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9816">They learned to criticize each other in a positive and supportive way, without fear and restraint. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9817">They learned to respect each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9818">They learned to serve the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9819">They learned that every person has a right to his or her own writing style and that you can’t change it, only support it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9820">She learned to respect the way he styles and fashions his words into polished prose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9821">He learned to admire and respect the way she worked—fast, clean, and accurate, always getting the job done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9822">They learned how to ask for help from each other, something that was difficult for both of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9823">In other words, they learned from each other, and supported each other in the same way that three men and a horse did in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9824">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9825">.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9837">First, you’ve got to find out whether it “works” or not; whether you should engrave it in stone or paper the walls with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9838">You need some kind of feedback to see whether it’s working and whether you wrote what you set out to write.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9839">At this moment you may not really be sure whether it works or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9840">You can’t see it; you’re too close to it, lost in the maze of subjectivity.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9841">Of course, the first thing you need to do before you send it out to be read by a few close friends is to back up the screenplay, either on disk or hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9842">This may be obvious, but it bears stating the obvious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9843">Keep the backup copy someplace it will be safe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9844">If you only have the original printout version, and have not backed it up, never give that original to anyone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9845">You have to have a copy of the script always available to you.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9846">I was recently retained as an expert witness in a lawsuit where the screenwriter had backed up his work only on his hard drive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9847">He thought he was covered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9848">When he began negotiations with a German production company on a coproduction deal, he printed out one copy and sent it off to Germany. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9849">After he sent the original hard copy, he wanted to install a DSL line so that he could e-mail his scripts with more speed and efficiency, so he hired the local phone company to install it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9850">But the installer told him his hard drive was too full to install the line and that he had to clean it up first. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9851">Well, you can probably guess what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9852">During the installation, the technician erased the entire hard drive and the writer had no backup, and because the German company had passed on the project, he had no hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9853">Basically, the writer had nothing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9854">He had to start over, from page one, word one, and re-create the screenplay from scratch.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9855">Sound far-fetched? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9856">Of course, but it’s the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9857">The moral of the story: Always back up your material.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9858">Now you’re ready to give a copy of your script to two friends, close friends, friends you can trust, friends who will tell you the truth, friends who are not afraid to tell you: “I hate it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9859">What you’ve written is weak and unreal, the characters flat and one-dimensional, the story contrived and predictable.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9860">Friends who will not be afraid to hurt your feelings.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9861">You’ll find that most people won’t really tell you the truth about your script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9862">They’ll tell you what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9863">they think</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9864"> you want to hear: “It’s good; I liked it! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9865">I really did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9866">You’ve got some nice things in it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9867">Or “I think it’s commercial,” whatever that means! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9868">People’s intentions are good, but they don’t realize they’re hurting you more by not telling you the truth, not telling you what they really think about it.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9869">Your name is going to be on the title page, so you want it to be the best script you can write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9870">If you feel a suggestion can improve your screenplay, use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9871">Any changes you make in a rewrite must be made from choice, and you have to be comfortable with those changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9872">This is your story, and you’ll know instinctively whether the changes work or not.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9873">Which brings us to the subject of the rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9874">You know the adage “Writing is rewriting”; well, it’s true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9875">The draft you send out into the marketplace is really three different drafts: the first “words on paper” draft; what I call “the mechanical draft”; and the third draft, “the polish.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9876">This is the draft where most of the script gets written.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9877">After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it aside for a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9878">Then go back and reread the material from beginning to end in one sitting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9879">Be sure to lock up all pens, pencils, and paper and to keep the computer turned off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9880">You don’t want to take any notes as you read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9881">You just want to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9882">When you go through the first “words on paper” draft, you’ll find yourself on the roller coaster of emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9883">Some parts you think are terrible: The writing is poor, the story is all told in dialogue, the descriptions are too long, too thick, too cluttered, and what you’re reading feels weak, awkward, too direct, and just doesn’t work.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9884">Then you’ll read other pages that you think work okay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9885">The dialogue is good, the action tight, and overall it seems to work pretty well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9886">Then you’ll go back on the roller coaster again, alternating between the emotions of elation and depression.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9887">That’s good.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9888">After you’ve finished reading the script, put it away again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9889">Now write three essays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9890">The first essay, in free association, is to write what first attracted you to the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9891">Do this in two or three pages, more if you choose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9892">Was it the character, the situation, the idea, or the action line that originally attracted you to the material? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9893">Just answer this question: What really attracted you to the material? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9894">Throw down your thoughts, words, and ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9895">Don’t worry about grammar or punctuation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9896">Write in fragments if you want to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9897">When you’ve completed this first exercise, go on to the next.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9898">The second essay, also in free association, answers this question: What kind of a screenplay did you actually end up writing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9899">You may have started to write a mystery-thriller with a strong love interest and ended up writing a love story with a strong mystery-thriller aspect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9900">Many times, we’ll start out writing one kind of story only to end up writing another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9901">For example, one of my students started out to write about the relationship of a day laborer to a woman above his class, and ended up writing about the relationship between the laborer and his brother when the woman comes between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9902">We want a clean, coherent narrative through line in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9903">Write this second essay in two or three pages.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9904">For the third essay: You saw what originally attracted you to the screenplay, and may have veered from this slightly while writing the first “words on paper” draft, so what you started out to do may be slightly different from what you ended up doing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9905">In this third essay, you want to answer this question: What do you have to do </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9906">to change</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9907"> what you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9908">did</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9909"> write into what you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9910">wanted</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9911"> to write? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9912">In other words, intention must equal result. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9913">In my student’s case, she had to go back to the beginning and establish and strengthen the relationship between the two brothers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9914">Sometimes you’ll be happy with what you ended up with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9915">Great! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9916">Other times you’ll have to make changes.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9918">Now read the first “words on paper” draft in units of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9919">Read Act I and make notes in the margins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9920">Out of twenty or so scenes, you’ll find you can keep ten of them intact. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9921">Of the remaining ten, you may have to change the focus in five or six of them by rewriting dialogue and possibly adding some action, and you may see that the remaining five scenes don’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9922">So, you’ll have to write five new scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9923">All in all, you may have to change anywhere from 65 to 80 percent of Act I.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9928">In Hollywood, nobody tells you the truth, what they really think; they might tell you they like it, then add, “But it’s not something we want to do at the present time”; or “We have something like this in development,” or “We’ve already done this movie.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9929">That’s not going to help you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-9930">You want feedback; you want someone to tell you what he or she really thinks about your script, so choose the people you give this first draft to carefully.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10034">There have been times when a writer has submitted material to a producer or studio and it’s been rejected, and sometime later the writer has seen his/her idea in a movie and thinks the concept was ripped off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10035">Sometimes this happens, and sometimes people </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10036">think</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10037"> it happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10038">Several years ago, the world-famous humorist-journalist Art Buchwald, with Alain Bernheim, wrote a movie treatment for a film called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10039">Coming to America</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10040"> for Paramount Pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10041">A deal was negotiated and they were paid. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10042">The studio ultimately passed on the idea and Buchwald continued with his journalistic chores. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10043">Later, an Eddie Murphy movie was released by Paramount that seemed to have been taken directly from the treatment that Buchwald and Bernheim had written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10044">Buchwald filed a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures claiming the studio had taken their idea and not paid them for it.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10045">The lawsuit garnered a lot of headlines, and also set a major precedent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10046">In order to prove their case, Buchwald and Bernheim had to reveal studio accounting practices, which was a monumental task, to say the least. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10047">Finally, after a long litigation, the court awarded them some $900,000 for copyright infringement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10048">They’d been able to prove “prior access,” meaning they proved they had submitted their idea to Paramount.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10049">Many times you’ll hear writers worrying about whether to submit a screenplay to a studio or production company because of fears their ideas will be stolen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10050">Well, according to copyright law, you “cannot copyright an idea, only the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10051">expression</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10052"> of the idea.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10053">An idea is three guys stealing moon rocks from Houston’s NASA facility. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10054">How</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10055"> they do it, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10056">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10057"> the characters </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10058">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10059"> who do it, is “the expression of the idea.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10060">That’s why if you write an unsolicited screenplay and want to submit it to a studio or production company, you will be asked to sign a release forgoing any right to litigate over any claims, either now or in the future, of copyright infringement.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10061">For example, many years ago a friend of mine wrote a script for a movie that was about a competitive skier on the European ski circuit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10062">She sent it to a number of production companies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10063">The companies all returned the material with a “thanks, but no thanks” letter.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10064">A couple of years later she went to see a movie about a skier on the European ski circuit, made by a company she had submitted her script to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10065">She saw a number of similarities to her screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10066">In fact, she thought it was her story.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10067">So, she went to court and filed a lawsuit and ultimately was granted a settlement because she proved prior access—she had registered her script at the WGA, West, and had a copy of the rejection letter from the production company.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10068">Nobody did anything “intentional” in this situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10069">The production company had refused her idea, for whatever reason, and when later it went looking for a subject for a film, someone “had an idea” about a competitive skier.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10070">There have been other times when a movie is released, and writers who have written a work, usually an unproduced novel or screenplay, claim copyright infringement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10071">They had submitted their material to the company but it was returned, unopened and unread. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10072">They had no case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10073">They could not prove prior access, and while the ideas may have been somewhat similar, the “expressions of the idea” were not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10074">I’ve been called as an expert witness on several of these cases, and not one was legally substantiated.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10075">When you’re ready to get your material into the marketplace, you’ll need about ten copies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10076">Most story executives don’t return material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10077">If you send it to a producer or company, you’ll need to keep a record of when you sent it and to whom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10078">If you do send it to a company, someone must know the script is coming, either through e-mail or as hard copy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10079">Otherwise, the material will be deleted, or returned unread, as no release form was signed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10080">(Sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your material simply lets the producer or story editor know you’re a novice screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10081">Don’t do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10082">The chances are it won’t be returned anyway.)

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10100">Do not send a synopsis of your script along with your material; it will not be read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10101">No one in Hollywood will read a treatment unless you’re an established screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10102">In Canada, Europe, South America, and perhaps the Far East, a writer can often sell his/her treatment and get money (though not much) from the government-subsidized film industry to develop the story into a screenplay—but that’s only on the international film scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10103">In Hollywood, if you send a synopsis with your material it will be to your disadvantage and like as not, immediately thrown out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10104">Usually, a screenplay has to pass the gauntlet of “The Reader.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10105">Decisions about whether or not to seriously consider a particular screenplay are usually based on this reader’s comments.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10106">So then how do you get it to people? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10107">Since most people in Hollywood don’t accept unsolicited material—that is, they don’t accept material unless it’s submitted through an authorized literary agent, an agent who has signed the Artists-Managers Agreement drawn up by the WGA—the question then becomes: Do I need an agent to sell my script, and if so, how do I get an agent?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10108">I hear that question over and over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10109">If you’re going to sell your script for a cool million or more and have Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts star in it, you’ll need a literary agent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10110">So, how do you get an agent?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10111">First, you must have a completed screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10112">An outline, or treatment, doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10113">Then you can contact the Writers Guild of America, West or East, and ask them, by e-mail, mail, or phone, to send you the list of authorized signatory agents to the Artists-Managers Agreement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10114">They’ll send you a list of agents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10115">Those agents who are willing to read unsolicited material from new writers are indicated, usually with an asterisk.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10116">List several of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10117">Contact them by mail, e-mail, or phone; ask if they would be interested in reading a screenplay by a new writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10118">Give your background; sell yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10119">Everybody is a buyer and seller in Hollywood.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10120">Most of them will say no. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10121">Try some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10122">They’ll say no, too. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10123">Try some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10124">Hollywood is a “no” town; it’s easier to say no than yes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10125">But just think what would happen if someone were to say yes to the material.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10126">If the film goes through the line of executives to finally be “green-lit” for production, and the film does get made, and does well at the box office, that’s a dream come true for you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10127">On the other hand, if it doesn’t do well, the person who brought in the material may be let go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10128">After all, there are millions of dollars riding on his/her decision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10129">The average life span of a film executive in Hollywood is about five years.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10130">Be that as it may, the irony is that executives are always looking for good material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10131">There is a dearth of salable material in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10132">Most of the screenplays submitted are derivative of old movies or television series or are takeoffs or satires on films that have already been made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10133">The opportunities for new screenwriters, writing fresh and original ideas, are enormous.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10134">Most of the time when you’re seeking representation, you’ll talk to the agent’s assistant or secretary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10135">Sometimes they’ll even be the ones to read your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10136">If they like it they’ll recommend it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10137">Let anyone who wants to read your script read it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10138">A good script does not go unfound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10139">As long as it’s legally protected, there’s usually not a problem.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10140">Even if an agent likes your screenplay, he/she may not be able to sell it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10141">But he will be able to show it around as a sample of your writing ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10142">As one agent told me, there’s nothing as hot as a script that “almost” gets sold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10143">Sometimes that will lead to a rewriting assignment, or an opportunity to pitch another one of your script ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10144">Sometimes, if a producer or story editor likes your work, you may be able to get a “development deal” from a studio or producer to write an original, or to adapt one of their ideas or books into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10145">Everybody’s looking for writers, no matter what “they” say.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10146">Give the agent three to six weeks to read your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10147">If you don’t receive a reply from him or her within that period of time, you can call.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10148">If you submit your script to a large, well-known agency, like William Morris, ICM, or CAA, the established agents will ignore it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10149">But they have readers and trainee agents there, and they all have an incentive to read it and possibly discover a marketable script.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10150">If you’re fortunate, you might even find someone who likes your work and wants to represent you.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10151">Who is the best agent?</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10152">The agent who likes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10153">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10154"> work and wants to represent </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10155">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10156">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10157">If you contact eight agents, you’ll be lucky to find one who likes your work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10158">You can submit your script to more than one agent at a time, but not at the same agency.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10159">A literary agent gets a 10 to 15 percent commission on whatever he or she sells. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10160">Good material does not get away from the readers in Hollywood; they can spot potential movie material within ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10161">If your script is good and worthy of production, it’s going to be found. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10162">How</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10163"> it’s found is another matter.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10164">It’s a survival process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10165">Your screenplay is entering the raging current of the Hollywood river, and like salmon swimming upstream to spawn, only a few will make it.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10166">If finding an agent the “normal” way is not working for you, a good way to get your work read and possibly “discovered” is by submitting it in one of the many screenwriting contests that now exist throughout the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10167">A mention to a production company that your script has been selected as one of the finalists, or winners, in a prominent screenwriting contest like the Nichols Fellowship, Final Draft’s Big Break Contest, the Chesterfield Competition, Script-Shark’s Annual Screenwriting Competition, the Diane Thomas Award, or any of several other competitions, carries a strong appeal in the exclusive world of Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10168">Each contest receives from three to five thousand entries each year, and at present there are over a thousand of them; just go online and Google “screenwriting contests.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10169">Take a look at the Database of Screenwriting Contests and Competitions (</span><a href="http://www.filmmakers.com/contests" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10170">www.filmmakers.com/​contests</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10171">) and you’ll find a list of contests and information on financial prizes, entry dates, deadlines, etc. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10172">The legitimate contests offer awards of up to $10,000 cash, as well as meetings with top agents and executives in the industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10173">I’ve been one of the judges for the Final Draft competition several times now and can tell you that the quality of the work is high. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10174">Many of the winners have gone on to find agents and have their screenplays produced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10175">That’s a good percentage of success, and a good way to break into the business.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10176">Another way to bring your script to the attention of production executives is called “online posting.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10177">For a fee you can send your script to an online literary service like ScriptShark.com, a division of Baseline StudioSystems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10178">ScriptShark is a professional script coverage and story development service specifically designed for the entertainment industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10179">It works this way: You submit your screenplay to ScriptShark and an industry reader will read and evaluate your material, then give you professional feedback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10180">If the reader likes the material, he/she will post the synopsis of the story on the service’s Web site. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10181">Most development and creative executives from major production companies check the postings daily because they’re always looking for new material; thus it’s a good way to get your material seen without going through an agent or attorney. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10182">And indeed, ScriptShark has been instrumental in helping more than one writer move forward professionally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10183">Several screenwriters have sold/optioned scripts, and ScriptShark has assisted them in setting up pitch meetings, landing writing assignments, and getting representation.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10184">After you complete your screenplay, you’re entering the battlefield. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10185">Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10186">Do you know how many movies the studios and independent production companies made last year? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10187">Not that many: between four and five hundred. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10188">And while the number of studio productions today is increasing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10189">slightly</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10190">, the number of people writing screenplays is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10191">dramatically</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10192"> increasing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10193">As the number of people writing screenplays is increasing, so is the cost of making movies—it costs several thousand dollars a minute to make a major Hollywood production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10194">That’s why even a medium-budget movie in Hollywood today costs somewhere between $60 and $80 million—and the cost of prints and advertising is mind-boggling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10195">A Hollywood production has to gross at least two and a half times its negative cost to break into profit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10196">So, if a film cost $60 million to produce, it has to gross more than $150 million to just to break even. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10197">Not many films gross $150 million. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10198">And if a film doesn’t open in its first or second weekend with good numbers, it will just disappear after a few weeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10199">But with the ancillary markets, foreign markets, the DVD market, merchandising products, and TV and cable sales, at some point in the future the film might still make some kind of profit.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10200">The only thing that does not change is the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10201">You may have the greatest special effects in the world, or the most popular actors in the world, but if there is no story that engages the hearts and minds and emotions of the audience, you don’t have much of anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10202">The story is the center, the hub, the dynamic force that holds everything together. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10203">Sideways</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10204"> is a good example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10205">Adapted from a novel by Rex Pickett, written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, starring four largely unknown actors, it is an exceptional movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10206">You can make a good movie from a good script; you can make a good movie from a mediocre script; but you can’t make a good movie from a bad script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10207">And that’s where all your energies should go—into writing the best script you can.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10208">What kind of a deal can you expect to make if someone wants to buy your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10209">Prices vary, but a good rule of thumb is the Writers Guild of America minimum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10210">The minimum is broken down into two categories: a low-budget movie that costs between $1.2 and $5 million to produce, and a high-budget film that costs more than $5 million. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10211">At this writing, the WGA minimum for a low-budget, original screenplay, including a treatment, is $48,738; for a high-budget film, $91,495. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10212">These minimums will increase each time a new MBA (Minimum Basic Agreement) is negotiated.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10213">Most screenwriters don’t sell their first screenplay, but there are exceptions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10214">One of my former students at the Professional Writing Program at USC wrote her thesis script and started sending it around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10215">An agent’s assistant read it, liked it, and gave it to her boss; he read it, liked it, and sent it to a friend of his, a production executive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10216">The executive liked it, told the agent, and the agent promptly sent it out and sold it for about $600,000. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10217">Now, the writer didn’t get all this money up front. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10218">She got a few thousand dollars when she signed the agreement, and if and when the producer gets a production/distribution agreement, she’ll get a large chunk; then, on the first day of principal photography, she’ll get another chunk, and there may even be a “production bonus.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10219">An “eyeball” price for a screenplay used to be 5 percent of the budget, though that varies substantially. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10220">If you sell the script, you’ll probably receive a “percentage of the profits,” at least on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10221">You may get anywhere from 2.5 to 5 percent of the producer’s net—whatever you can get. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10222">But since hardly any films ever show a profit, at least in the accountants’ books, the chances are slim to none that you’ll ever receive any of your percentage.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10223">If someone wants to buy your script, he/she will probably </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10224">option</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10225"> it for a year, with an option for a second. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10226">With an option, someone pays you for the exclusive right to get a “deal” or to raise financing for a certain period of time, usually a year or two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10227">The option price may be anything, from $1 a year to $100,000 or more—whatever you, or your attorney, can negotiate.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10228">It may take you more than a year after you receive your option money to receive the full amount for the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10229">This is the standard-type “step deal” in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10230">The numbers may vary, but the procedure will not.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10231">If you do get an offer on your script, let someone represent you, either an agent or an attorney. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10232">An attorney will either charge by the hour or receive 5 percent of your earnings from the project.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10233">You can obtain an option for a book or novel just like a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10234">If you want to adapt a book or novel, you must obtain the motion picture and theatrical rights to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10235">To find out if the material is available, call the publisher of the hardbound edition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10236">Ask, either by mail, e-mail, or phone, for the subsidiary rights department. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10237">Inquire if the motion picture and theatrical rights are available. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10238">If they are, they’ll tell you or refer you to the literary agent who represents the author. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10239">Contact the agent, who will tell you whether the rights are available or not.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10240">If you decide to adapt the material without obtaining the motion picture rights, you might find you’ve wasted your time, that the rights are not available and somebody else owns them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10241">If you can find out who has the rights, that person or company might be willing to read your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10242">Or might not.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10243">If you want to adapt the material simply as an exercise, do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10244">Just be sure you know what you’re doing so you’re not wasting your time.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10245">It costs so much to make a movie today that everyone wants to minimize the risk; that’s why money paid to a writer is termed “front money,” or “risk money.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10246">No one likes to take a risk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10247">And the motion picture business is one of the biggest crapshoots around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10248">No one knows whether a given film is going to “go through the roof,” like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10249">Star Wars, Titanic</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10250">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10251">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10252">, and people are reluctant to put up a lot of front money for an uncertain return. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10253">Do you know anyone who spends money easily? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10254">Including yourself? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10255">Studios, production companies, and independent producers are no exception.</span></p>

		<p class="morespaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10280">When I first started out as a writer and teacher, I asked myself what I wanted to accomplish in my teaching and books, and the answer was always the same: I wanted screenwriters to write better movies, movies that would serve and inspire audiences around the world to find their common humanity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10281">I knew future technologies would emerge and that there would be new, more advanced ways of telling stories with pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10282">But I felt that if people understood what makes a good story, what makes a good screenplay, it would be of value to filmmakers and audience alike. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10283">When I uncovered the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10284">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10285">, I didn’t really discover anything new; this concept of storytelling has been around since Aristotle’s time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10286">I simply uncovered what was already there, gave it a name, and illustrated how it worked in contemporary movies.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10287">Over the last few years there’s been a significant technological evolution going on in the world of film, and understanding the role of dramatic structure in the screenplay has become the focus of intense and international debate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10288">The discussion rages between conventional and unconventional methods of storytelling, between linear and nonlinear means of storytelling, between </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10289">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10290"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10291">The Manchurian Candidate; The Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10292"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10293">The Bourne Supremacy; Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10294"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10295">Pulp Fiction; The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10296"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10297">The Hours; Y Tu Mamá También</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10298"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10299">Run Lola Run;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10300"> and many, many more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10301">Of course, each screenplay, each story, is unique and individual, but I find these debates good because they inspire conversations of discovery, new points of departure in the evolution of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10302">The essence of structure does not change; only the form changes, the way in which the story is put together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10303">And if that leads to new ways of telling stories with pictures, then I’ve accomplished what I set out to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10304">So while “we may be through with the past,” as the Narrator says in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10305">Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10306">, “the past may not be through with us.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10307">I believe the silver screen is like a mirror, reflecting our thoughts, our hopes, our dreams, our successes, our failures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10308">Writing a screenplay and going to the movies is an ongoing journey, a lifetime adventure; for those images on the page and those dancing shadows of light on the giant screen simply reflect our lives, where the end might be the beginning, and the beginning the end.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10309">As I sit in a darkened theater, I’m sustained by an unbridled hope and optimism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10310">I don’t know whether I’m looking for answers to my own questions about life, or whether I’m sitting in the dark silently giving thanks that I’m not up there on that giant screen confronting the struggles and challenges I’m seeing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10311">But I do know that somewhere in those reflected images, I may glean an insight, an awareness, a hope that might embrace the personal meaning of my life.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10312">I think about this as I look back over the footprints of my journey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10313">I see where I began my trek, gaze over the ground I’ve covered, the trails I’ve traversed, and understand it’s not the destination but the journey itself that is both the goal and the purpose.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10314">Just like writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10315">It’s one thing to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10316">say</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10317"> you’re going to do it; it’s another to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10318">do</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10319"> it.</span></p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10328">Try not to make any judgments about what you’ve written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10329">It might take years for you to “see” your script objectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10330">You may never. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10331">Judgments of “good” or “bad” or “right” or “wrong,” or comparisons between “this” and “that,” are meaningless within the creative experience.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10332">It is what it is.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10333">Hollywood is a “dream factory,” a town of talkers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10334">Go to any of the various hangouts around town and you’ll hear people talking about the scripts they’re going to write, the movies they’re going to produce, the deals they’re going to make.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10335">It’s all talk.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10336">Action is character, right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10337">What a person </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10338">does</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10339">, and not what he says, is who he </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10340">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10341">.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10342">Everybody’s a writer.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10343">There is a tendency in Hollywood to second-guess the writer; the studio, the star, the director, the producer will all make changes in the script that they think will “improve” it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10344">Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10345">Most people in Hollywood assume they’re “larger” than the original material. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10346">“They”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10347"> know what has to be done to “make it better.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10348">Directors do this all the time.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10349">A film director can take a great script and make a great film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10350">Or he can take a great script and make a terrible film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10351">But he can’t take a terrible script and make a great film.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10352">No way.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10353">Some film directors know how to improve a screenplay by visually tightening the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10354">They can take a wordy dialogue scene of three to four pages and condense it into a tense and dramatic three-minute scene that “works” with five lines of dialogue, three looks, somebody taking a drink, a dog barking, and an insert of a clock on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10355">Michael Mann did this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10356">Collateral;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10357"> he sculpted the original screenplay by Stuart Beattie, visually tightening it into a tension-packed film that captures both the essence and the integrity of the script.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10358">That’s the exception, not the rule.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10359">The rule is that most directors and stars in Hollywood have little or no story sense at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10360">They’ll second-guess the writer, making changes in the story line that weaken and distort it, and eventually a lot of money is spent making a lousy film that nobody wants to see. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10361">And you’re only as good as your last film.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10362">In the long run, of course, everybody loses—the studios lose money, the director adds a “flop” to his “track record,” and the writer takes the rap for writing a bad screenplay.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10363">Everybody’s a writer.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10364">Some people will complete their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10365">Others won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10366">Writing is hard work, a day-by-day job, five or six days a week, three or more hours a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10367">And some days are better than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10368">A professional writer is someone who sets out to achieve a goal and then does it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10369">Just like life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10370">Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it or you don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10371">And then there’s the old “natural law” of survival and evolution.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10372">There are no “overnight success stories” in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10373">Like the saying goes, “The overnight success took fifteen years to happen.”</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10374">Believe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10375">It’s true.</span></p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10376">Professional success is measured by persistence and determination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10377">The motto of the McDonald’s Corporation is summed up in its poster called “Press On”:</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10508">That was the question my mentor Jean Renoir, the great French film director, often presented to us during the year he was Artist in Residence at the University of California, Berkeley. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10509">I met him after a performance of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10510">Woyzeck</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10511">, the Georg Buchner expressionist drama, in which I was playing the lead role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10512">I was told that Renoir was going to present the world premiere of his play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10513">Carola</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10514">, and I was being asked to audition for the part.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10515">A few days later, I read for Renoir, got the third lead in the play, playing the role of Campan, the French stage manager, and so began my mentorship with a man who would ultimately shape my attitude toward movies and my life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10516">For the next year, I had a direct, close, and personal relationship with the great director. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10517">Not knowing much about film, what it was or what it could be, it was Renoir who opened up a treasure chest of knowledge and insight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10518">He shared his personal view that movies “are a new form of printing—another form of the total transformation of the world through knowledge.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10519">He would refer to Lumière, inventor of the early French motion picture camera called the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10520">Cinématographe</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10521">, as “another Gutenberg.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10522">Renoir insisted that movies had the potential to be literature, but they should never be considered art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10523">When I asked what he meant, he replied that art is the sole vision of one person, which in the scheme of the filmmaking process, is a contradiction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10524">He explained that one person can’t do everything that’s required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10525">One person can write the screenplay, direct the film, photograph it, edit it, and score it—like Charlie Chaplin did—but, Renoir continued, the filmmaker cannot act all the parts, or record all the sound, or handle all the lighting requirements amid the myriad other details that are required to make a movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10526">“Art,” he said, “should offer the viewer the chance of merging with the creator.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10527">As young college students learning from the master, we would literally sit at his feet and ask questions, share our ideas, or discuss our opinions of life and art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10528">He would answer everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10529">Every question, even the dumbest one, was received with interest and respect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10530">When someone asked, “how can we be true to our art?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10531">he shared his personal philosophy that “art is in the doing of it.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10532">A simple answer, yet profound, relevant, and true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10533">It’s only during the process of working, he explained, whether directing a film, writing a song, writing a script, painting a picture, or whatever it may be, that one “creates art.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10534">Art, he proclaimed, is the process of actually sitting down and doing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10535">Not talking about doing it, not thinking or fantasizing about doing it, just doing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10536">Only after the work has been completed and exposed to public view will it be considered a work of “art” or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10537">If you think you’re “an artist” just waiting for that one moment of inspiration to sit down and write, you’ll be waiting forever.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10538">Over the past twenty-five years, I’ve thought about Renoir’s words as I’ve traveled the world conducting screenwriting seminars for professional and aspiring screenwriters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10539">As I look back over the footprints of my life from the time I wrote the first edition of this book, some twenty-five years ago, to now, I see that screenwriting, both as an art and a craft, has evolved into an international language of engaging visual expression.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10540">We’re currently standing on the threshold of a new frontier in film, and there are no rules as to what we can or cannot do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10541">It is a time of evolution/revolution, a time of transformation in which the theater of technology has embraced a new era of digital technology. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10542">What we see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10543"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10544">how we see it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10545"> have changed.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10546">Story exposition is shown rather than told; characters are revealed through behavior, not dialogue; time present and past have merged into a compelling storytelling device. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10547">As said in Eastern philosophy, the inside and outside are one; the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are inside our head are what creates the fabric of our experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10548">Basically, you are the baker of the bread you eat.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10549">A screenplay is a special form; it is a story told in pictures, expressed in dialogue and description. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10550">The technological impact has facilitated a change in our classic traditional narrative; linear story lines like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10551">Casablanca</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10552"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10553">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10554">, expressed in long expository scenes, have become more visually stylized presentations such as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10555">Sideways, Magnolia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10556">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10557">Brokeback Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10558">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10559">Nonlinear storytelling, almost a rarity during the last few decades, has now become part of a film lexicon that seems taken for granted: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10560">The Bourne Supremacy, Memento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10561">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10562">The Constant Gardener</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10563">, are structured in bits and pieces from the shards and broken fragments of memory and have become part of the screenwriter’s language.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10564">The question Renoir posed so many years before, “</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10565">Qu’est-ce que le cinéma?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10566">” is as relevant today as when I first heard it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10567">How do we define the art of film? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10568">How do we analyze it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10569">How do we craft our movies so they are more than mere flashing images on the screen, but become what Renoir referred to as “an art form that is larger than life.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10570">We are now living in a time of visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10571">Whether you want to tell a story on the big screen or write a television show that can be downloaded onto an iPod, cell phone, or PDA; whether you want to create a video game or short film; a business plan or a Power-Point presentation for any future delivery system, you have to know the tools and rules of visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10572">That’s what </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10573">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10574"> is all about.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10575">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10576"> explores the process of writing a screenplay, which is visual storytelling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10577">I call it a “what-to book,” meaning that if you have an idea for a screenplay, but don’t exactly know what to do to write it, this book will guide you through the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10578">No matter whether it’s a feature, a short film, a commercial, or other form of visual presentation, the book works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10579">Read a chapter, do the exercise at the end of the chapter, and by the end of the book you will have written a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10580">The screenwriting process can be applied to any form of visual storytelling.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10581">The Screenwriter’s Workbook</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10582"> is based on the screenwriting workshops I have conducted around the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10583">I design and structure these seven-week workshops so students spend the first four weeks preparing to write, and the second three weeks writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10584">The goal of the class (and I’m very big on goals) is to write and complete the First Act, (anywhere from twenty to thirty pages) of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10585">People come into a workshop with a short idea of their story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10586">For example: “My story is about a woman executive on vacation in Hawaii, who meets and has an affair with a young man, then returns home only to learn the relationship doesn’t work.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10587">That simple.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10588">In the first class we talk about the subject of the screenplay, the action and character—basically </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10589">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10590"> happens and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10591">whom</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10592"> it happens to—and discuss the nature of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10593">Their first assignment when they leave the class is to structure their idea, then write a four-page treatment focusing on the ending, the beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10594">I call this the “kick in the ass” exercise because the student is taking an unformed idea and trying to give it form; it very well may be the most difficult pages the participant writes.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10595">The second week we talk about character, and how to give the main character a history by writing a character biography, the character’s life from birth up until the time the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10596">They also outline the character’s professional life, personal life, and private life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10597">Their assignment for the next week is to write character biographies of their main character and one or two other major characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10598">The third week we structure the story line of Act I on 3 × 5 cards, and write up a back story, that is, what happens either a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10599">The fourth week we write the first ten pages and the rest of the workshop is devoted to writing approximately ten pages a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10600">At the end of this seven-week session, the student will have completed the First Act of their screenplay, anywhere from twenty to thirty pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10601">We take a short break and then continue into the Second Act Workshop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10602">The goal of this seven-week course is to write and complete Act II of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10603">In the third seven-week workshop they complete Act III and rewrite the material.</span></p>

			<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10672">A short time ago, I was having dinner with a group of friends, and as is so often the case, the subject turned to movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10673">We talked about films we had seen, films we liked, films we didn’t like, and what we liked or disliked about them, which covered a broad spectrum ranging from the acting performances to the editing and photography to the music, special effects, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10674">We talked about some of the great moments in films, lines of dialogue that still reside in our awareness, and while the conversation was intriguing and stimulating, what I really found so interesting was that nobody made any mention of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10675">It was as if the script didn’t exist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10676">When I mentioned that fact, the only response I got was, “Oh yeah, it was a great script,” and that’s about as far as it went.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10677">I immediately noticed a short pause in the conversation, and then one of the other guests, an actress and television talk show host, mentioned she had written a book and several of her friends wanted her to turn it into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10678">She confessed she felt she needed a “partner” to help her take her novel, her own story, and write it as a screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10679">When I asked why, she explained she was frightened of “confronting” the blank sheet of paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10680">But she had already written the novel, I replied, so how could she be frightened about turning it into a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10681">Was it the form that challenged her? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10682">Or the visual description of images, the sparseness of dialogue, or the structure that frightened her? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10683">We discussed it for a while and as she was trying to explain her feelings, I realized many people have that same fear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10684">Even though she was a published author, she was afraid of dealing with the blank page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10685">She didn’t know exactly what to do or how to go about doing it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10686">This is not such an unusual scenario. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10687">Many people have great ideas for a screenplay but when they actually sit down to write it they are seized by fear and insecurity because they don’t know how to go about actually doing it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10688">Screenwriting is such a specific craft that unless you know where you’re going, it’s very easy to get lost within the maze of the blank page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10689">The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10690">If </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10691">you</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10692"> don’t know what your story is about, who does? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10693">Throughout my many years of teaching screenwriting, both here and abroad, people approach me all the time and tell me they want to write a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10694">They say they have a great idea, or a brilliant opening scene, or a fantastic ending, but when I ask them what their story is about, their eyes glaze over, they stare off into the distance and tell me it’ll all come out in the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10695">Just like Miles when he tries to describe what his novel is about to Maya in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10696">Sideways</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10697">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10698">Great.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10699">When you sit down and tell yourself that you’re going to write a screenplay, where do you begin? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10700">With the dream of a heroic action like the Max Fischer character (Jason Schwartzman) in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10701">Rushmore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10702"> (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson)? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10703">With still photographs that show us the era in which your story takes place, like the Great Depression in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10704">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10705"> (Gary Ross)? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10706">In a darkened bedroom, with a clock ticking loudly and two people moaning in sexual passion, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10707">Shampoo</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10708"> (Robert Towne and Warren Beatty)?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10709">If you tell yourself you want to write a screenplay and then vow to commit weeks, months, or even years writing it, how do you confront the blank page? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10710">Where does the writer begin? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10711">It’s a question I hear at workshops and seminars all the time.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10712">Does the writer begin with a person, location, title, situation, or theme? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10713">Should he/she write a treatment, outline it, or write the book first and then the screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10714">Questions, questions, questions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10715">All those questions really reflect </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10716">the</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10717"> question: How do you take an unformed idea, a vague notion, or a gut feeling and transfer that into the roughly one hundred and twenty pages of words and pictures that make up a screenplay?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10718">Writing a screenplay is a process—an organic, ever-changing, evolving stage of growth and development. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10719">Screenwriting is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10720">Like all literary arts, whether fiction or nonfiction, plays or short stories, there are definite stages a writer works through while fleshing out an idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10721">The creative process is the same no matter what you’re writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10722">When you sit down to write a screenplay and confront the blank page, you have to know what story you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10723">You only have a hundred and twenty pages to tell your story, and when you begin writing it’s apparent very quickly that you don’t have much room to work with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10724">A screenplay is more like a poem than a novel or play in which you can feel your way through the story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10725">James Joyce, the great Irish writer, once wrote that the writing experience is like climbing a mountain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10726">When you’re scaling a mountain, all you can see is the rock directly in front of you and the rock directly behind you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10727">You can’t see where you’re going or where you’ve come from. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10728">The same principle holds true when you’re writing a screenplay; when you’re writing all you can see is what’s in front of you, that is, the page you’re writing and the pages you’ve written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10729">You can’t see anything beyond that.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10730">What do you want to write about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10731">You know you have a great idea that will make an awesome movie, so where do you begin? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10732">Are you writing a challenging character study? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10733">Are you writing about a personal experience that impacted your life? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10734">Maybe you read a great magazine or newspaper article that you know will make a great movie.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10735">One of my students in a recent screenwriting workshop was a published novelist and former editor of a major book publisher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10736">She had never written a screenplay before and shared with me that she was somewhat nervous and insecure about writing the script.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10737">When I asked why, she replied that she didn’t know if her story was visual enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10738">She wanted to write a script about an active middle-aged woman who suffers a life-changing traumatic injury, and had doubts about the main character’s confinement to a hospital bed during most of the second act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10739">This raised another concern: would the main character be too passive? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10740">Could the interest in the character’s plight be sustained with this limited sense of visual action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10741">These were all valid, major considerations, requiring significant creative decisions.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10742">During her preparation period we had several discussions, talked about the possibilities of opening it up, using the visual components found in the hospital: tests like EEGs, CAT scans, PET scans, and X-rays, and having the action broken up by the arrival of emergency cases and the various activities of the nurses on the floor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10743">I wondered what would happen in the character’s life while she was in the hospital. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10744">I suggested that she could show bits and pieces of the woman’s former life, possibly through dreams and memories, and weave those flashbacks throughout. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10745">Because the main character was so static during the Second Act, she could add several more visuals to the story line about what the woman was thinking and feeling.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10746">Feeling more secure, my student began preparing her material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10747">She did her research, structured the First Act on cards, wrote up the back story, designed the opening sequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10748">As a novelist, she had always researched her ideas thoroughly and gradually, and it would be through the actual writing experience that she would find her story and characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10749">She told me she did not want to know “too much” because, in her experience, she wanted to let the story guide her to where it wants to go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10750">I replied that you can do this when you’re writing a novel or play, but not when you’re writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10751">A screenplay is a specific form; approximately one hundred twenty pages in length and knowing the end is always the first step in writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10752">You can “feel” your way through a four-hundred-fifty-page novel, or a one-hundred-page play, but not a screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10753">A screenplay follows a definite, lean, tight, narrative line of action, with a definite beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10754">A screenplay always moves forward toward the resolution, even if it is told in flashback like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10755">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10756"> (Tony Gilroy), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10757">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10758"> (Alan Ball.) A screenplay follows a singular line of action so every scene, every fragment of visual information, must be taking you somewhere, moving the narrative forward in terms of story development.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10759">This was somewhat difficult for my student to understand because it was unlike her previous writing experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10760">But after she had done her preparation, when she knew her structure and had done some background character work, she was ready to start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10761">She began writing the first act, the emphasis on the professional life of her main character, an active and dynamic woman responding to the challenges of the workplace with energy and integrity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10762">As a professional woman, it was clear her character was active, likable, and well drawn.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10763">But when the main character entered the hospital after the traumatic injury at the end of Act I, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10764">tone</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10765"> of the story changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10766">The character was now confined to a hospital bed, weaving in and out of consciousness for several pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10767">Feeling the story becoming boring, my student became insecure and started looking for new cinematic areas to explore rather than focusing on the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10768">One day she called to tell me she was writing new scenes with doctors and nurses, then told me she had a sudden inspiration to bring in the main character’s daughter, an executive who always seemed to have trouble dealing with authoritarian male figures like doctors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10769">I told her to go ahead and try it; after all, if it works, it works, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10770">All she would really lose was about three days of writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10771">So she began writing this new character, the daughter, in Act II, and then another problem began to surface: the daughter was emerging as the dominant character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10772">The mother, the main character, now seemed to be lost somewhere in a hospital room. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10773">By making the daughter the active force, or voice, in the story, my student had shifted the focus of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-10774">The story was now about a daughter taking charge of the health and well-being of her mother.</span></p>

It wasn’t long before the monks were illustrating their manuscripts with scenes from the Bible, and soon they were decorating their walls with illustrations similar to Roman frescoes; then these scenes were put on wood panels which leaned against the wall, and this gave way to painting on canvas which then hung on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11205">The Accademia Museum displays a marvelous collection of this early Italian painting.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11314">I started from the obvious: even though they are all nonlinear in their stylistic approach, all have a beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11315">I remembered a line from the great Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s play </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11316">Three Sisters</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11317"> that has always stayed with me: “The principle thing in life is its form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11318">That which loses its form, ends itself, and it’s the same with our everyday existence.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11319">Everything in life has a form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11320">Every twenty-four-hour period is exactly the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11321">The day begins in the morning, goes into the afternoon, and is followed by night. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11322">You can make further distinctions with that of course: early morning, later afternoon, late night, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11323">It’s the same with the twelve-month period we label a year; it’s always the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11324">The same with our seasons: there is spring, summer, fall, and winter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11325">It never changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11326">It’s always the same, but different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11327">Remember the riddle that Sophocles presented for Oedipus: he asks what walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11328">The answer: A human being.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11329">All these questions led me to believe that there was something in these films that I needed to explore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11330">I started with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11331">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11332">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11333">I got a copy of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11334">When I read the title page, it said that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11335">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11336"> was really “three stories…about one story.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11337">I turned the page and read two dictionary definitions of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11338">pulp:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11339"> “a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter,” and “a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11340">That’s certainly an accurate description of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11341">But on the third page, I was surprised to find a Table of Contents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11342">I thought that was rather odd; who writes a Table of Contents for a screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11343">Then I saw the film was broken down into five individual parts: Part I, the Prologue; Part II, Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace’s Wife; Part III, The Gold Watch; Part IV, The Bonnie Situation; and Part V, the Epilogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11344">As I studied the script, I saw that all three stories bounce off the key incident of Jules and Vincent Vega retrieving Marsellus Wallace’s briefcase from the four guys. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11345">This one incident became the hub of all three stories, and each story is structured as a whole, in linear fashion; it starts at the beginning of the action, goes into the middle, and then proceeds to the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11346">Each section is like a short story, presented from a different character’s point of view.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11347">If this key incident is the hub of the story, as I now understood it, then all the actions, reactions, thoughts, memories, or flashbacks, are tethered to this one incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11348">The entire film is structured around this one event, and then branches off in three different directions.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11349">Suddenly, it all made sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11350">Understanding “three stories about one story” allowed me to see the film as one unified whole. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11351">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11352"> is three stories surrounded by a prologue and epilogue, what screenwriters call a “bookend” technique: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11353">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11354"> uses that same device. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11355">So do </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11356">The Bridges of Madison County</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11357"> (Richard LaGravenese), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11358">Sunset Boulevard</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11359"> (Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett), and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11360">Saving Private Ryan</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11361"> (Robert Rodat).</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11362">Now I began to see how </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11363">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11364"> was put together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11365">The Prologue sets up the two characters, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), in a coffee shop discussing various types of robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11366">When they finish their meals, they pull their guns and rob the place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11367">The film freezes and we cut to the main titles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11368">Then we cut into the middle of a conversation between Jules (Samuel L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11369">Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta), driving and having an enlightening discussion about the relative merits of a Big Mac both here and abroad.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11370">Part I sets up the entire film and tells us everything we need to know; the two men are killers working for Marsellus Wallace; their job, their dramatic need, is to retrieve the briefcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11371">That’s the true beginning of the story, and by this reckoning, in Part I, Jules and Vincent arrive, state their position, kill the three guys, and only by the grace of God do they leave alive with Marvin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11372">That’s the key incident of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11373">They report back to Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11374">Vinnie takes Mia (Uma Thurman) out to dinner, and after she accidentally overdoses on some heroin, he revives her and they say good night, promising not to share what happened with anyone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11375">Part II is about Butch (Bruce Willis) and his gold watch and what happens when he wins the fight, killing the other fighter, instead of losing it like he had agreed with Marsellus Wallace in Part I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11376">Part III deals with cleaning up Marvin’s remains, which are splattered all over the car—a continuation of Part I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11377">That’s followed by the Epilogue where Jules talks about his transformation and the significance of Divine Intervention in their lives, and then Pumpkin and Honey Bunny resume the holdup that began the film in the Prologue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11378">Seeing that connection in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11379">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11380">, comparing it with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11381">El Callejón de los Milagros</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11382"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11383">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11384"> started me thinking about the changes occurring in the screenplay due to the impact of technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11385">In each case they shared something in common; besides the way the stories are laid out, besides the special effects and intriguing subject matter, all three films created an emotional response. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11386">At that moment, I realized that no matter how a film may be structured, the language of the cinema speaks directly to the heart, as Ingmar Bergman used to say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11387">It doesn’t matter whether the story is told in a linear or nonlinear form; it doesn’t matter whether the story is told with ingenious special effects, or branded with the visual brilliance of the director or the great acting of the actors or the broad sweep of the photography or the poetry of the editing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11388">When you really get right down to it, there’s only one thing that holds the whole thing together.</span></p>

			<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11509">A screenplay is unique: as a story told in pictures, utilizing both dialogue and description to move the story forward, the narrative line is held together within the context of a dramatic structure that anchors the story line in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11510">There is a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11511">We spoke about context as being “the space” that holds something in place, that something being the content—all those scenes, sequences, action, dialogue, characters, and more, that make up the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11512">Context doesn’t change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11513">Content changes.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11514">Structure is form.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11515">“A screenplay,” as William Goldman says, “is structure, structure, structure.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11516">To illustrate the context of structure—what it looks like—we build a model, just like an architect builds a model to scale so we can “see” what a building looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11517">We build the context of dramatic structure by illustrating it with the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11518">A paradigm is defined as “a model, an example, or a conceptual scheme.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11519">It is really a tool or guideline, a roadmap through the story of the screenwriting process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11520">The more I learn about the paradigm, the more amazed I am at how important it really is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11521">I conceived the paradigm after writing nine original screenplays and reading in excess of two thousand screenplays and more than a hundred novels looking for material during my stint as head of the story department at Cinemobile Systems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11522">Most of what I read was not very good; as a matter of fact, I only found forty out of two thousand screenplays to submit to our financial partners. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11523">Since then, I have read, analyzed, and worked with screenwriters on thousands and thousands of screenplays in several different languages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11524">The one thing that all good screenplays have in common is structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11525">Structure is like a system; in science, systems are referred to as either being open or closed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11526">A closed system is like a rock—it takes nothing from its environment and gives nothing back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11527">There is no interchange between the rock and whatever its surroundings may be.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11528">An open system is like a city: it interacts with its environment, and there exists a natural interchange between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11529">The city depends on the earth of the surrounding areas for food and raw materials, and people in those areas depend upon the city for jobs, trade, and other services. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11530">There is a give-and-take exchange between the city and its surroundings.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11531">Writing a screenplay is very much an open system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11532">You plan what you’re going to write—for example, “Grace leaves Bill’s apartment and takes a long walk through the city”—but sometimes it doesn’t work out that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11533">Grace “tells” you she doesn’t want to go on a long walk through the city—she wants to listen to music, go dancing, have an apple martini, and be around people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11534">And if that ever happens, you better listen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11535">That spark of spontaneity that jolts an unexpected image or thought or sequence or line of dialogue is what makes the creative process an open system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11536">But you’ve got to be open to receive the new ideas and allow the process to emerge from your creative self. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11537">You can’t let any preconceived notions or ideas hamper you from taking another direction in the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11538">The writing experience should always be an adventure, and we’re never really quite sure how the creative process is going to reveal itself to us.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11539">That’s what teaching is all about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11540">It, too, is an open system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11541">The teacher presents the material to the students; they listen, question, doubt, argue, and assimilate whatever connects with them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11542">The way they listen can create a possible breakthrough in the understanding of craft, or an expansion of the original material, which in turn could evolve into the story taking a new direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11543">If we’re open to the process, the story may take an unseen “twist,” expanding the story line or characters, even adding new characters and subplots. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11544">The structure of the story may even change.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11545">Over the years, I’ve defined the paradigm in many ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11546">If we could hang a screenplay on the wall like a painting, we could “see” what it looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11547">For example, if you wanted to illustrate the paradigm of a table how would you define it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11548">What is a table? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11549">A top with four legs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11550">But that covers a lot of ground; there are many different types of tables: a short table, long table, high table, low table, or narrow table. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11551">There can also be a square table, round table, rectangular table, or octagonal table. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11552">You could also have a chrome table, wrought-iron table, wood table, glass table, plastic table, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11553">As you can see, the paradigm of a table does not change; it is “a top with four legs.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11554">That is its nature; that’s the model of a table.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11555">If you’re building a new house, or remodeling an old one, you hire an architect or designer to draw blueprints, preliminary plans, and working plans. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11556">But if you’re like I am, you may have trouble visualizing what the house is going to look like when it’s finished based only on a blueprint. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11557">Lines on paper do not really show you the walls, doors, and ceilings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11558">Some of us need to see a model before we can make any kind of aesthetic decision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11559">It doesn’t matter whether it’s a house, office building, swimming pool, tennis court, car, bus, or boat, sometimes we just need to see it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11560">In other words, we need a model.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11561">In the same way, the paradigm is a model, an example, a conceptual scheme of what a screenplay looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11562">If we could hang it on the wall like a painting, and see it in its wholeness, this it what it would look like:</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11564">Let’s explore the context of the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11565">Here’s how it works: If a screenplay is “a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure,” what is a story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11566">And what do all stories have in common?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11567">A beginning, middle, and end—though as mentioned, not always in that order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11568">Because we’re dealing with a dramatic medium, the beginning corresponds to Act I, the middle to Act II, the end to Act III.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11569">The average length of a film is about two hours long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11570">Since one page of screenplay equals approximately one minute of screen time, the average screenplay is about one hundred and twenty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11571">Some are longer, some shorter, but most are close to this length. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11572">The contracts being written by most major Hollywood studios and production companies today usually stipulate that movies in production cannot be longer than two hours, eight minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11573">That means approximately one hundred and twenty-eight pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11574">And you are not the exception.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11575">You may want to check this out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11576">Read a screenplay, then see the movie and determine if it’s true or not! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11577">Check your watch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11578">You should be reading as many screenplays as you can to familiarize yourself with the visual presentation of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11579">If you’re seriously interested in writing a screenplay, you should be reading all the scripts you can get your hands on, and seeing all the movies you can afford—in a movie theater, if possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11580">If not, then rent or buy the DVD.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11581">If you don’t have access to any screenplays, go online and search the Web. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11582">There are many Web sites devoted to the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11583">At some sites, you can download scripts free of charge—sites like </span><i class="calibre3"><a href="http://simplyscripts.com" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11584">simplyscripts.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11585"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><a href="http://Script-O-Rama.com" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11586">Drew’s Script-O-Rama.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11587"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><a href="http://dailyscript.com" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11588">dailyscript.com</span></a></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11589">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11590">Or, do a Google or Yahoo search for “screenplays” and see what comes up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11591">There are many, many sites and many, many screenplays you can download.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11592">It breaks down this way: Aristotle states there are three unities of action—time, place, and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11593">Act I is a unit of dramatic (or comedic) action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11594">It begins at the beginning, page one, with the opening shot or sequence, and goes through to the end of Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11595">It is approximately twenty to thirty pages long and is held together by the dramatic context known as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11596">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11597">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11598">Act II is a unit of dramatic action that begins at the end of Plot Point I and extends through the end of Plot Point II, and it is approximately fifty or sixty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11599">It is held together by the dramatic context known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11600">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11601">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11602">Act II is all about conflict and obstacles confronted and overcome. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11603">All drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action, and without action, you have no character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11604">Without character, you have no story, and without story, you ain’t got no screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11605">If you know your character’s dramatic need—that is, what he or she wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay—then you can create obstacles to that need and your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11606">Act III is also a unit of dramatic or comedic action; it goes from the end of Plot Point II, approximately page eighty or ninety, to the end of the screenplay, roughly page one hundred and twenty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11607">It, too, is roughly twenty to thirty pages long and is held together with the dramatic context known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11608">Resolution</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11609">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11610">It’s important to remember that resolution means solution and in this unit of action your story is resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11611">Not necessarily wrapped up neatly, but complete in whatever way you choose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11612">In this, the preparation, or preplanning stage of writing the screenplay, what you need to know about the resolution of your story is basically what happens to your character at the end of the story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11613">Does your character live or die, succeed or fail, win the race or not, return safely home or not, get married or divorced? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11614">Resolution means solution and Act III is all about how your story is resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11615">If you don’t know how to resolve your story, ask yourself how </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11616">you would like it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11617"> to be resolved, regardless of how effective it is, or whether “they”—those unknown film executives who live in your head—would like it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11618">It’s your story so you get to choose how it’s going to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11619">And that will be your starting point.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11620">When Stuart Beattie was preparing his script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11621">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11622">, he knew that Max (Jamie Foxx) had to stand up to the hired killer to save his life as well as to redeem himself; otherwise, he would just be another murder statistic on the streets of L.A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11623">That’s the character arc that Max had to go through in order to realize that his “someday dream” would never happen unless he made it happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11624">Beattie structured the evolution of the character just like he did the story and it’s a good illustration of using the paradigm as a structural template.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11625">In many films, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11626">American Beauty</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11627"> (Alan Ball), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11628">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11629"> (Tony Gilroy), Act I is anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11630">We’re not talking numbers here, we’re talking </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11631">form:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11632"> beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11633">Act II can be anywhere from fifty to sixty pages, plus or minus a few pages, and there are times when Act III is fifteen to twenty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11634">The paradigm, remember, is only a model, an example or conceptual scheme. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11635">It’s not something that’s laid down in concrete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11636">As a matter of fact, the great thing about structure is that it’s fluid; like a tree in the wind, it bends, but doesn’t break.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11637">Act I is a unit of dramatic action that sets up your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11638">In the first twenty to thirty pages of screenplay, you must set up your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11639">You must introduce your main characters, establish your dramatic premise (what the story is about), create the dramatic situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and set up the relationships between your character’s professional life, his or her personal life (relationships), and his or her private life (private time and hobbies). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11640">Most, if not all, of these elements need to be established in this first unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11641">Everything in Act I focuses on setting up your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11642">You don’t have time for cheap tricks or clever scenes or cute dialogue if they don’t move the story forward, establish the relationships between the characters, or reveal information about the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11643">You’ve got to set up your story immediately, from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11644">The purpose of each scene is either to move the story forward or reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11645">Anything that does not serve these two functions should be dropped. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11646">Act I sets up the story and holds each scene and sequence in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11647">Context, remember, is the space that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11648">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11649"> the content in place; all those scenes, dialogue, description, shots, and special effects that make up a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11650">Everything in this unit of action sets up everything that will follow.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11651">A perfect example is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11652">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11653"> (Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11654">After the brief prologue establishing the history of the Ring, we follow Gandalf as he enters the Shire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11655">There, we meet Frodo, Bilbo Baggins, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, and see the Hobbit’s life in the Shire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11656">We learn that Bilbo found the Ring, wants to leave the Shire to write his book, and uses the Ring to disappear from his birthday party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11657">That causes Gandalf to research the history of the Ring, and soon realizes the danger that the Ring brings with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11658">Already, the dark horsemen of Sauron are searching the Shire for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11659">Frodo reluctantly inherits the Ring when Bilbo vanishes and Gandalf convinces Frodo of the need to leave the Shire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11660">So Frodo and Sam set out on their journey—their mission: to travel to Mordor, land of the enemy, and destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11661">The act of Frodo and Sam leaving the relative safety of the Shire now takes us into Act II where they encounter obstacle after obstacle before they reach their journey’s end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11662">(As a side note, the context of Part II, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11663">The Two Towers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11664">, is all about confrontation and the overcoming of obstacles.) Everything is set up in this first unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11665">We establish relationships between the main characters: we know who the main character is (Frodo), what the story is about (destroying the Ring in the fire), and what the dramatic situation is (Sauron, rallying the forces of evil to destroy Middle Earth).</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11729">Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11730">A Plot Point can be anything you want it to be as long as it moves the action forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11731">It is a function of character, leading us from Act I into Act II or from Act II into Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11732">It should be noted here that there can be many Plot Points in your screenplay but at this stage in the writing process, the preparation, we are only focusing on Plot Points I and II; they are the anchor points that hold the elements of your story line in place.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11733">Before you can write one word on paper, you must know four things: your ending, your beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11734">Only when you know these four elements can you start to “build” or structure your story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11735">Act II is also a unit of dramatic or comedic action, held together by the context known as Confrontation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11736">Act II goes from the Plot Point at the end of Act I to the end of Plot Point II and is approximately fifty to sixty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11737">During this section of your screenplay, your character will be challenged by numerous obstacles to achieve his or her dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11738">If you know your character’s dramatic need—what your character wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of your screenplay—then you can create the necessary obstacles and your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle to achieve his or her dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11739">As mentioned earlier, all drama is conflict—without conflict there is no action; without action, there is no character; without character there is no story; and of course, without story, you have no screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11740">Obstacles can either be internal (fearing a confrontation) or external (caught in a dangerous situation like Jamie Foxx in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11741">Collateral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11742">). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11743">Mostly, they are a combination of both.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11744">Act II is often the most difficult act to write because it is the longest unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11745">(With the new material presented in this workbook, Act II is broken down into two workable units of action.) In Act II, every scene you write, every shot you describe, every sequence you devise is held together within the context of Confrontation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11746">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11747">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11748">, the two women run from the crime they committed because they panic and don’t know what else to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11749">Once on the run, they encounter obstacle after obstacle: they’ve run from the scene of a crime, don’t have enough money, have very little gas, and are scared. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11750">They encounter all kinds of obstacles, either internal (fear and uncertainty of what they’ve done and what’s going to happen to them) or external (the police want them for questioning).</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11758">Near the end of Act II she meets Saul (Alan Bates), an artist, at the art gallery where she works and has sex with him, but refuses to see him again, saying she’s still experimenting and doesn’t want to enter into any kind of relationship, especially a serious one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11759">“Nothing personal,” she adds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11760">A few nights later she meets him again at a party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11761">They talk, enjoy each other’s company, and decide to leave the party together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11762">Despite what she had said at the end of their sexual encounter, she likes him and he likes her, and soon she feels comfortable enough to spend more time with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11763">The Plot Point at the end of Act II is when they decide to leave the party together; it occurs about eighty or ninety minutes into the film and is the incident that “spins the action around into another direction”—in this case, Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11764">The third act focuses on Erica’s new relationship with Saul. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11765">This is the way it looks on the paradigm:</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11966">Writing a screenplay is more about the journey than the destination. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11967">It is an ongoing, evolving process that changes day to day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11968">You prepare the material in stages or steps. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11969">First, you need an idea, which is broken down into a subject, the action and character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11970">Then, when you have your subject, you can structure it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11971">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11972"> with the four anchoring points that hold your story together: the ending, beginning, Plot Points I and II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11973">You really can’t write anything with any degree of certainty until you know those four things; they are the foundation of your story line, the glue that holds your story together.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11974">Only when you know these four elements can you begin to tell your story in a narrative fashion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11975">In fact, the word “narrative” means an arrangement, or sequence of events or happenings, factual or imagined, and implies a sense of direction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11976">The story progresses from beginning to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11977">And direction, remember, is a line of development.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11978">Putting your story down on paper is essential because it’s a necessary stage in fleshing out and developing your idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11979">How accurate it will be in terms of the finished screenplay five or six months from now, or how good or bad it is, is totally irrelevant.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11980">That’s why I think it’s necessary to write a short, four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11981">A treatment is defined as a narrative synopsis of your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11982">Some dialogue can be included if it helps to shed light upon the lives of your characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11983">I have my students write four-page treatments because it helps articulate and define the structural events that hold the story together.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11984">Why is this necessary? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11985">Because it allows you to take those unformed, fragmented ideas that are running around your head and put them down on paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11986">It sharpens the details of your story and clarifies the relationships you’ve been thinking about.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11987">I call this a “kick in the ass” exercise, because you’re taking this amorphous idea, or notion, and trying to give it form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11988">It’s an important step in the screenwriting process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11989">It should be mentioned that in Hollywood, a treatment, any kind of a treatment, is only a writer’s tool; it’s just part of the ongoing journey of writing a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11990">Writing a treatment and hoping it will sell, is only a pipe dream. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11991">A treatment is not a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11992">Don’t expect the treatment you write to be sold, or optioned, especially if you’re a new or aspiring screenwriter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11993">In television, it’s a different story; there, treatments, or beat sheets, or outlines, may be developed in conjunction with the production executive and the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11994">But we’re talking about screenplays here, and in Hollywood only a finished screenplay can be sent out to studios and production companies.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11995">It’s also a different story in Europe and in some Latin American countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11996">In Europe, for example, a treatment is often sold or optioned by members of the Film Commission or Ministry of Culture, and then the writer is given a nominal sum of money to develop the treatment into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11997">What happens to the screenplay after it’s written, of course, is anybody’s guess. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11998">Sometimes, the treatment is optioned, a screenplay written, and then it simply sits on a shelf somewhere gathering dust for whatever reason—a director is not available or doesn’t like the material or the budget is too high or there’s been a change in the policy or members of the Film Commission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-11999">Whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12000">I hear this over and over and over again from European and Latin American screenwriters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12001">The stories are legion.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12018">After writing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12019">Spree</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12020">, I realized I could possibly earn a living as a writer while waiting for some kind of a production job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12021">So, I became a screenwriter living the life of a freelancer—a job here, a job there, just enough to make ends meet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12022">It went on like this for the next seven years, during which time I wrote nine original screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12023">Two were produced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12024">The next four scripts I wrote were optioned, meaning a producer paid me a certain sum of money so he or she had the exclusive right to produce the movie for a certain length of time, usually two years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12025">At the end of that period, the rights reverted back to me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12026">The three others I wrote went nowhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12027">Everybody told me how much they liked them, but nothing happened with them and they still sit on my shelf. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12028">“Hollywood,” said novelist Dorothy Parker, “is the only place where you can die from encouragement.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12029">The way I worked was simple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12030">I would get an idea and research it—get books from the library and talk to people about it until I felt comfortable with the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12031">Then I would do my character work, write character biographies, talk to more people, look at pictures, read any first-hand accounts from diaries of that period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12032">Next I would sit down and start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12033">I used to call it “hitting my head against the typewriter.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12034">I always came up with a script, but the cost, both physically and emotionally, was very high. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12035">It was a slow and painful process, and after years of working this way, I began to look at screenwriting as something I </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12036">had</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12037"> to do rather than something I </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12038">wanted</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12039"> to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12040">There’s a big difference between the two; one is a negative experience, the other positive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12041">While it’s important to see both sides, writing is too hard a job, too demanding a task, to color it with a negative or painful experience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12042">One of the scripts I wrote during this time was a painful, but ultimately beneficial experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12043">It was a western about a man named Balinger who rode with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, an “unchanged man in a changing time,” as Peckinpah used to say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12044">But when Butch and Sundance left for South America in 1902, my character, Balinger, refused to believe the times were changing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12045">He stayed behind, pulled a couple of holdups, was caught, sentenced to prison, escaped, and continued to do the only thing he knew how to do: rob banks.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12046">Balinger was a character who was at odds with the times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12047">On one hand, he was born ten years too late; on the other, he was born ten years too early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12048">That was the basic idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12049">He was a character who didn’t belong.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12050">In the back story, Balinger robs a bank, gets caught, and is sentenced to prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12051">I wanted to open the script with an exciting sequence of Balinger escaping from prison, having served four years of a ten-year sentence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12052">After he escapes, he teams up with his old partner, adds a few young members to his gang, and begins to pursue his old way of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12053">But of course, times have changed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12054">Banks have started using checks, stocks and bonds are negotiable securities, and with something called the telephone you could call from Denver to San Francisco. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12055">Balinger couldn’t understand that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12056">After planning a robbery, his expectations are thwarted because nothing works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12057">In one job he gets a bundle of checks, along with a thousand dollar bill he can’t cash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12058">Another job nets only a few hundred dollars in coins and some stock certificates.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12059">At this point, he doesn’t know what to do or where to go, and the Pinkerton detectives chasing him are closing in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12060">Balinger knows his time is at an end and talks about joining Butch and Sundance in Bolivia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12061">One last job—a big one, he thinks—will do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12062">So, the motley group rides to a town in Washington State, on the banks of Puget Sound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12063">They pull the job, but in the ensuing shoot-out, the money is left behind and Balinger chooses to end his own life by deliberately colliding with the Coast Guard cutter chasing him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12064">His last words were something like, “Maybe Butch and Sundance had the right idea.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12065">That’s about all I knew when I sat down in “the pit” and started writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12066">But this time, “hitting my head against the typewriter” didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12067">Or, I should say, it worked for about thirty pages, and after that I went into a state of confusion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12068">I didn’t know what happened or what to do or where to go, and after struggling with the story line for several weeks, I plunged into the infamous writer’s block.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12069">It was awful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12070">To help me, I started doing a lot of drugs, but instead of finding my story I simply got further and further away from it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12071">I became angry, despondent, and frustrated, then surrendered to a deep depression. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12072">It went on for several weeks, until I became frightened, and stopped taking everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12073">Cold turkey.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12074">A few days later a friend of mine, then the story editor for a major production company, called and we went out to dinner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12075">During the course of the meal I shared the problem with him and he asked a very simple question: “What’s your story about?”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12076">I looked at him dumbfounded. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12077">In all my despair and pain and depression over my “writing block,” I had forgotten all about my story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12078">It was the first time I had been asked to tell the story, to describe it out loud.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12079">I stammered awhile, trying to remember what it was about, and finally managed to blurt out the basic idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12080">He listened, asked some pertinent questions, made some suggestions, and told me he wanted to see something in writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12081">I agreed, and when I returned that night, I sat down and wrote a short treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12082">I couldn’t believe what happened—as soon as I knew my story, my writer’s block vanished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12083">That’s when I suddenly understood: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12084">“The hardest thing about writing is knowing what to write.”</span></i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12085">That experience taught me how important it is to know your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12086">In all my screenwriting workshops and seminars across the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and South America, I continually stress the fact that you must know your story before you can write anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12087">And it all starts when you’re able to take the four elements, the ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II, and structure them into a dramatic story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12088">Why a four-page treatment and not ten or twenty pages?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12089">Because at this stage you really don’t know much about your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12090">You only have a general idea of an action and character, and a general basis for your plot, as well as the four anchoring points: ending, beginning, Plot Points I and II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12091">That’s all you know about your story at this point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12092">You don’t know what the purpose of a particular scene is or what part it plays in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12093">You probably don’t even know whether it moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12094">Most of us don’t have the answers to these kinds of questions at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12095">We have to frame in the story line, anchor it in the foundation of narrative.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12096">The treatment helps set you up for the actual writing of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12097">So, when you’re writing this short, four-page treatment, don’t get carried away with excessive detail. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12098">Adding in too much detail now does not serve your best interests.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12099">You’ll always be able to be more specific later on, adding individual characterization, what kind of a car he or she drives, how his or her apartment looks, the paintings on the wall, and why he or she goes by train and not plane. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12100">You don’t need to know that right now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12101">Later on, yes.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12102">That’s why a four-page treatment is a good length at this stage for organizing your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12103">It is not your story, it’s just an outline of the story, a start point in the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12104">So put all your expectations, your hopes and dreams away in a drawer somewhere where they’re out of sight, and simply sit down and write the treatment.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12105">Here’s the assignment: you’re going to write a four-page treatment, a narrative synopsis, of your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12106">In the preceding chapters, we talked about isolating the idea and putting it into a subject. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12107">Basically, it describes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12108">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12109"> your story’s about and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12110">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12111"> it’s about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12112">Then we took the subject and broke it down on the paradigm so we knew the ending, the beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12113">The </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12114">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12115"> becomes your structural anchor.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12116">Now take the subject of your story line—the action and character—and lay it out in dramatic structure on the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12117">Choose your ending first, then determine your beginning, then choose Plot Point I and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12118">Do it the same way you did the structure exercise in the previous chapter.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12210">Something else to take into account: if your character’s dramatic need changes at Plot Point I, be clear on what the new dramatic need is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12211">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12212">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12213">, the two women start out for a weekend holiday, but after killing the would-be rapist, their dramatic need changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12214">Now, they are two women wanted for questioning who are running from the police.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12217">We’ve completed Act I so now you’re ready to move on into Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12218">Act II is a unit of dramatic action that is approximately sixty pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12219">It begins at the end of Plot Point I and goes to the end of Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12220">It is held together with the dramatic context known as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12221">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12222">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12223">If you know your character’s dramatic need—what he or she wants to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the screenplay—you can create obstacles to that need and then your story becomes your character overcoming obstacle after obstacle (or not overcoming them) to achieve his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12224">Remember, all drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12225">Without conflict you have no action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12226">Without action, you have no character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12227">Without character, you have no story, and without story you have no screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12228">So think about Act II for a moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12229">Your character is going to be encountering conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12230">Conflict means “in opposition to,” so what does your character encounter? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12231">It’s important to note that there are two types of conflict: External conflict, where a force is working against the dramatic need of the characters, like being pursued or pursuing someone, being captured by an enemy, trying to survive during a natural disaster, overcoming a physical injury, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12232">Then there’s internal conflict, such as fear, whether it’s fear of failure, fear of success, or fear of intimacy or commitment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12233">An internal conflict can become an impediment to the character’s action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12234">It is an emotional force within the character that interferes with his or her dramatic need.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12235">Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12236"> (Anthony Minghella) is a good example. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12237">Inman, the Jude Law character, is wounded during the Civil War and taken to a hospital behind the lines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12238">In flashback and voiceover narration, we see and hear about his relationship with Ada (Nicole Kidman). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12239">She wants him to “come back to me,” so Inman deserts the Confederate Army and starts his physical and emotional journey back to Cold Mountain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12240">The community of Cold Mountain is not only a physical town, but also an emotional place in the heart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12241">Inman has to overcome all kinds of obstacles, including weather, enemy soldiers, capture, and being hunted by the Confederate Police to serve his dramatic need: returning to Cold Mountain and Ada. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12242">The obstacles he confronts during Act II are both internal and external, and bring drama and tension as he attempts to survive the journey home.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12243">Ada’s conflict is also both internal and external. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12244">She has been raised with the skills and qualities of a “lady”—she can play the piano, be a premiere hostess at church gatherings, read, and be a personable companion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12245">But, she doesn’t know the first thing about surviving on the farm after her father dies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12246">She must deal with the internal frustration of not knowing what she has to do to survive, mending fences or planting crops or just fending for herself.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12247">Most of the time we encounter both internal and external conflicts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12248">So, as you prepare to describe the action that takes place in Act II, it’s a good idea to sketch out some of the obstacles your character may confront.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12249">First, take a separate sheet of paper, and list four obstacles your character confronts during Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12250">Do you know what they are? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12251">Can you define and articulate them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12252">Are they internal obstacles or external? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12253">Think about it and when you’re ready, just list them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12254">Ask yourself whether these four obstacles generate a sense of dramatic conflict within the progression of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12255">If your story is about a botanist in the Grand Canyon, possible obstacles might include the dangers of running the white-water rapids; succumbing to the tremendous heat; or a physical hardship, such as a severe ankle strain or a broken bone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12256">It could be the raft overturning, losing supplies, or friction between the other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12257">Select four conflicts, either internal or external, or some combination of both, but always making sure they are obstacles that confront your character and that move the story forward to the Plot Point at the end of Act II.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12258">When that’s complete, go back to your treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12259">In a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12260">narrative synopsis</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12261">, summarize the action of Act II in a page, using these four conflicts as the anchoring points of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12262">Just follow your character as he or she confronts each obstacle, and then summarize the obstacle in about a quarter of a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12263">It’s important to generate a dramatic flow to the material at this point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12264">Focus on your character confronting and overcoming these obstacles and simply describe the action—that is, what happens—in broad strokes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12265">As mentioned, you’ll find that if you spend too much time on the specific details of the action, you’ll wind up with something like eight pages, not four. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12266">So, keep the material general; at this stage, too much detail is the enemy.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12454">As we toured the tiny, sparse rooms of the church and monastery and climbed the steep paths that wandered along the wooded hills, walking through shadows and sunlight, I noticed the birds were everywhere, chirping and singing in a cacophony of sound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12455">I stood observing this symphony of sound and movement, thought about walking on the same path as St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12456">Francis, and I became aware that my breathing had become calm and even, my mind still, and I felt like I was in a meditative state. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12457">I looked around the beautiful landscape and wondered whether I was experiencing this feeling because of the harmony of the landscape, or whether the land and trees and birds had absorbed St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12458">Francis’ state and I was just immersed in the energy or vibration of the place itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12459">I wondered whether this divine state, mind calm but senses totally alert, was the same state that St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12460">Francis referred to in his poetry and writings.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12461">I speculated as to whether we, as human beings, have this same potential to transcend our ordinary reality and enter this state of transcendence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12462">It was like I had merged into the environment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12463">I don’t know how long I stood on that footpath, absorbed in this energy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12464">It could have been a few minutes or an hour. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12465">When I looked around, I saw a large number of birds resting on tree limbs nearby, and I knew deep down inside, they were watching me, like they were tuning into my thought waves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12466">It was an extraordinary experience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12467">I roused myself and started down the path leading to the monastery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12468">As I made my way down the hill, I found myself wondering what kind of a person St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12469">Francis was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12470">Was he such a radiant and powerful being that he could transcend his identity as a man and merge into this living energy, or vibration, to became one with the spirit of the birds and animals of Assisi? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12471">What kind of a person was he that he could rise above his human limitations and become one with this divine energy? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12472">In other words, what qualities did St. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12473">Francis possess that made him so unique as a person?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12474">And that brought up the question of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12475">It was a question I’ve asked myself many times, both as a teacher and a student, when writing and teaching about the qualities of character.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12477">Is it the character’s purpose or motivation? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12478">Is it the dialogue that he or she speaks? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12479">Is it what the character wants to achieve during the course of the screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12480">Is it his insights or cleverness or credibility or believability? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12481">His integrity? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12482">Is it the action he goes through to achieve his dramatic purpose? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12483">What qualities must a character possess to keep us interested in him or her as he or she moves through the landscape of the screenplay?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12484">Philosophers talk about a man’s life as being measured by the sum total of his actions; our lives are “measured” by what we accomplish, or do not accomplish, in our lifetime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12485">“Life consists in action,” Aristotle said, “and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.”</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12487">Action is character—a person is defined by what he does, not what he says.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12488">In a screenplay, either the character drives the action, or the action drives the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12489">For example, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12490">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12491">, Jason Bourne sets out on a personal journey to avenge the death of his girlfriend Marie, and to find out who is after him and why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12492">It could be a story of revenge, but instead becomes a story of discovery and redemption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12493">In this case, the character drives the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12494">He learns that his fingerprints were found in Berlin where two CIA agents were killed, while he was several thousand miles away, in Goa, India. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12495">Who is after him? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12496">And why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12497">Midway through the film, he discovers that he was responsible for killing a Russian politician and his wife several years earlier. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12498">Now he must accept the responsibility for his actions and find the daughter of the two people he killed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12499">It is his actions that determine his character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12500">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12501">Batman Begins</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12502"> (Chris Nolan and David Goyer), the action drives the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12503">Bruce Wayne sets out to avenge the murder of his father and mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12504">But first, he must overcome his fear of bats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12505">If anything, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12506">Batman Begins</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12507"> is a story of the caped crusader overcoming his own fears to bring justice and order to Gotham City. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12508">These two elements become the narrative thrusts that drive the story forward to its dynamic resolution.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12509">In the classic film </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12510">The Hustler</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12511">, written by Sidney Carroll and Robert Rossen, from the book by Walter Tevis, Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a smooth-talking, fast-shooting pool player from Oakland. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12512">Fast Eddie comes to town to take on the “king of straight pool,” Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12513">Though Fast Eddie may be a better pool player, his attitude and his action make him, in Bert Gordon’s (George C. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12514">Scott) terms, “a loser.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12515">During the story, Fast Eddie goes from being a loser to being a winner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12516">That is his action, his character arc.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12517">Good characters are the heart and soul and nervous system of your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12518">The story is told through your characters and this engages the audience to experience the universal emotions that transcend our ordinary reality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12519">The purpose of creating good characters is to capture our unique sense of humanness, to touch, move, and inspire the audience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12520">“When you create characters,” the great English playwright and screenwriter, Harold Pinter says, “they observe you, their writer, warily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12521">It may sound absurd but I’ve suffered two kinds of pain from my characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12522">I have witnessed their pain when I’m in the act of distorting or falsifying them, and I’ve suffered pain when I’ve been unable to get to the quick of them, when they willfully elude me, when they withdraw into the shadows.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12523">“There’s no question a conflict takes place between the writer and his characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12524">On the whole I would say the characters are the winners, and that is as it should be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12525">When a writer sets out a blueprint for his characters and keeps them rigidly to it, where they do not at any time upset his applecart, when he has mastered them he has also killed or rather terminated their births.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12526">F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12527">Scott Fitzgerald wrote in one of his journals that “when you begin with an individual, you create a type.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12528">His first novel, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12529">This Side of Paradise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12530">, written when he was twenty-two or twenty-three, portrayed a dazzling heroine modeled after his wife Zelda. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12531">The book quickly became a best-seller, and it wasn’t long before the “type” created by Fitzgerald was celebrated in the movies, in the likes of Clara Bow, who would soon become known as the “It” girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12532">Women all over the country imitated her, dressed like her, styled their hair like hers, and acted and talked like her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12533">She typified “the flapper,” truly a phenomenon of the twenties.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12534">The flapper is really a type. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12535">In the same way, James Dean was a type because he inspired others to look and act like him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12536">The flower child of the sixties was a type, as were The Beatles and Bob Dylan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12537">These performers influenced an entire generation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12538">Long hair became the fashion, antiwar demonstrations became commonplace, and hippies were everywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12539">Madonna is a type because she inspires a new way of thinking and dressing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12540">Michael Jordan is a type—not only was he a great and celebrated basketball player, but an athlete who shaved his head and influenced others to do the same for more than a decade.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12541">Creating good characters is essential to the success of your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12542">That means you want to create “a type.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12543">As mentioned earlier, all drama is conflict; without conflict, you have no action; without action, you have no character; without character, you have no story; and without story, you have no screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12544">When you set out to create your characters, you must know them inside and out; you need to know their hopes and dreams and fears, their likes and dislikes, their background and mannerisms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-12545">In other words, they have to have a personal history.</span></p>

			<p class="spaceabove"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13536">When you’re writing the screenplay, the most essential aspect to keep in mind is that all drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13537">Many writers seem to forget that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13538">If the purpose of the scene in a screenplay is to either move the story forward, or reveal information about the character, the writer sometimes feels that telling the story means moving the character through the action like a chess piece without focusing on the conflict.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13539">Why is conflict so important in writing the screenplay?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13540">Because it creates tension, rhythm, suspense, and keeps the readers, or viewers, on the edge of their collective seats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13541">A movie is larger than life, and if you want to write a script that brings a certain order to the world, you need to engage the reader. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13542">That means generating conflict.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13689">“I’d rather be caught dead,” she states emphatically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13690">And, of course, it becomes a prophetic remark. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13691">From Oklahoma City, the only way to get to Mexico without going through Texas is the long way around, through Utah and Arizona. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13692">It is this decision that ultimately costs both women their lives, and at this point, they wouldn’t have it any other way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13693">This Circle of Being event, I feel, is triggered in the parking lot when Louise sees Harlan attempting to rape Thelma. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13694">Louise totally loses it and pulls the trigger, killing Harlan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13695">To me, the Louise pulling the trigger in that parking lot is not the Louise of the present time; rather, it is the young girl who was raped in Texas many years earlier.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13696">Later, Hal, the police detective (Harvey Keitel), tells her on the phone, “I know what happened in Texas,” and a little later Thelma, referring to the rape attempt, guesses that “it happened to you, didn’t it?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13697">To the very end, Louise does not respond.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13698">Creating a Circle of Being event for your character is an invaluable tool to use in crafting and enriching your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13699">If you go into your character’s life and ask yourself what traumatic incident might have occurred in your character’s life between the ages of nine and eighteen, see what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13700">You might even explore your own life and see what, if any, traumatic event might have occurred in your life during this time frame.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13701">Why nine to eighteen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13702">First, because it seems to be the most formative period in a person’s life and results in specific behavioral patterns that remain either consciously or unconsciously in the psyche. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13703">The noted behaviorist Joseph Chilton Pierce states there are four major periods of growth, or spurts, of human intelligence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13704">The first intelligence growth period occurs when the child is about a year old, when they learn to walk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13705">The second intellectual spurt occurs when the child is about four years old and learns that he or she has a distinct identity and communication skills. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13706">The third stage of intellectual growth occurs when the child is about nine or ten; that’s the age when he understands that he has a singular and individual voice and begins to question authority, forming his or her own opinions about what’s right or wrong and starts speaking his mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13707">This is a vital time in the life of the young person.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13708">The fourth stage of human intelligence, and perhaps the most important developmental spurt according to Pierce, occurs when the person is about fifteen or sixteen—the teenager. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13709">That’s the age when the young person starts rebelling against authority and tries to find his or her own voice; she suddenly understands that her parents are no longer the center of the universe, and she looks outward, into the world for models of behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13710">The young person is heavily influenced by his peers, and may begin to dress differently, color his hair, get body piercings or tattoos, and experiment with drugs, actions which are more acceptable to his peers than to his parents or society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13711">But these actions express teenagers’ individuality and who they are within the context of their own peer group. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13712">They have an identity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13713">Just look at your own kids, or your nieces or nephews, or your friends’ kids, and how they dress, act, and react.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13714">It’s a period of a person’s development so influential that it can leave a subconscious imprint for the rest of his life, much like furniture leaves an impression in the rug. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13715">Take a moment and look back into your own life and see how influential this time was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13716">Just close your eyes and go back to the time when you were about that age, anywhere from nine to eighteen, or thereabouts, and see if there was any specific incident or event that affected you the most. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13717">What was the incident or event that springs to mind? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13718">Take a moment to consider how that event might have affected you and possibly changed your life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13719">If you go back into your character’s life and create an incident or event that becomes a major influence, then you can enhance the texture and depth of any character you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13720">By creating a Circle of Being event you can generate conflict or a plot complication that will expand the dimension of your character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13721">One of my students, a well-known and working playwright, wanted to make the switch from writing for the stage to writing for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13722">He had an interesting story that involved the reconciliation of two sisters after an absence of many years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13723">The story opens with the main character, a dentist, undergoing a dental procedure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13724">While under the influence of the anesthesia, she flashes back to a time when she was a young girl and witnessed her sister being raped by their uncle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13725">Fearful of being seen, she ran away and in her flight, tripped over a rock, fell, and injured her front teeth—the same teeth which are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13726">acting up now</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13727">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13728">She had totally repressed the memory of this event until now and it leads her to reconcile with her sister. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13729">This Circle of Being event sparked the entire story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13730">The themes of reconciliation and forgiveness thus became the narrative thrust of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13731">I suggested to the writer that we see the Circle of Being event as the story unfolds in visual bits and pieces scattered throughout the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13732">She recovers the incident in visual fragments, and the final script turned out to be very powerful material. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13733">The Bourne Supremacy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13734"> uses this same kind of visual technique throughout the narrative as we see fragments of Bourne’s memory as he tries to recall the murder of the politician Neski and his wife, in Berlin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13735">It adds tension and power to the film experience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13736">That’s the influence of the Circle of Being. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13737">Once you’ve created an experience or incident that affects the life of your character, then you can base the character’s emotional arc on that incident and have him or her confront and resolve (or not resolve) the experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13738">It becomes a way of embellishing character, creating a strong, defined point of view and attitude, and contains within it the spark of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13739">Some films use the Circle of Being as the basis of the story line, and it becomes the subject of the entire film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13740">Quentin Tarantino’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13741">Kill Bill: Vol. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13742">1</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13743"> is another good example of this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13744">Both </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13745">Kill Bill: Vol. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13746">1 and Vol. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13747">2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13748"> deal with the theme of revenge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13749">But it is the Circle of Being event that defines the story of The Bride (Uma Thurman) and O-Ren (Lucy Liu), her opponent in Part I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13750">In an animation sequence, we see how O-Ren becomes the leader of the Japanese underworld. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13751">As a child, she witnesses the murder of her parents by a Japanese gangster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13752">She lies huddled under the bed during the butchery and swears eternal revenge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13753">A few years later, she gets her revenge by seducing her parent’s killer and murdering him and his henchmen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13754">She becomes the most notorious assassin in Japan and soon rises to the top of the Japanese underworld. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13755">This ultimately leads to the showdown between O-Ren and The Bride that occupies almost the entire second half of the first film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13756">We see in graphic detail how the Circle of Being event changed O-Ren’s life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13757">Sometimes you’ll be able to find a Circle of Being event for your character with no problem whatsoever and it will just flow naturally from the character biography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13758">Other times it may not be so easy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13759">You may have to work, struggle, think, ponder, reflect, and contemplate what the Circle of Being event might be in your character’s life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13760">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13761">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13762">, the Circle of Being plays a prominent part in the transformation of Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young FBI trainee tracking a serial killer, who must come to grips with an incident that occurred in her own childhood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13763">That incident, the death of her father, a small-town policeman killed during an attempted robbery, creates a major gap in her life and has influenced a subconscious search for a father figure.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13764">The extraordinary screenplay by Ted Tally focuses on Clarice’s relationship with three fathers: her real, biological father, who’s kind of a ghost figure during the action; Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), the Director of the Behavioral Science Division at the FBI Academy, who’s loving but stern, and remains somewhat distant; and the brilliant but deadly Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who becomes a kind of mentor to her, guiding and teaching her what to look for when pursuing the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13765">As </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13766">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13767"> unfolds, each one of Clarice’s “fathers” has something to teach her as she walks the path from being the student to being the professional.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13768">The search for the father is a major theme in literature. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13769">Many times, a person’s character, psychologists say, is reflected in the search for the father, but in reality, it is really searching for your own true nature. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13770">Often, a person searches for their destiny as their destiny is searching for them.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13771">The death of Clarice’s father is the Circle of Being event in her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13772">Because of her father’s death, she is sent to live with an uncle in Montana. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13773">One night, she’s awakened by the screaming of lambs being slaughtered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13774">When she is caught trying to rescue one of the baby lambs, she is sent away to an orphanage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13775">Hannibal Lecter forces her to look at this emotional event she’s been shielding and allows her to recreate it, thus becoming free of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13776">By the end of the film she has transformed her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13777">She is now on the threshold of building a new life, not only in terms of her relationship to men but professionally as a top-notch FBI agent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13778">Only when she is able to confront this incident in her past can she truly be free.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13779">How can the Circle of Being affect your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13780">In many ways, obviously, but I find its importance is that it provides a source of conflict, either inner or outer, that your character must confront during the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13781">One of my favorite examples is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13782">Seabiscuit</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13783">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13784">We see Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) being given away because his family cannot take care of him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13785">Can you imagine being given away by your parents when you’re about fifteen because they can’t take care of you?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13786">This is Red’s Circle of Being scene, and though it is taken from a real event in his life, it is something that could be discovered while writing the character biography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13787">In the film, Red is watching a horse race in a carnival when his father approaches, carrying a pillowcase filled with his favorite books. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13788">“I’m so sorry,” his father begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13789">He looks at Red. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13790">There are tears in his eyes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13791">The trainer, his father says, “has a house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13792">A real house…There’s even a phone next door so we can call you every couple of weeks and let you know where we are….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13793">“No,” Red cries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13794">His father reaches down, hugs his son.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13795">Red doesn’t know what’s happening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13796">“You’ll be great at this [racing horses],” his father whispers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13797">“You’ve got a gift…we’ll come back.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13798">Then he hugs his son again wanting to believe his own words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13799">“We will….We will.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13800">His mother weeps.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13801">Red watches, still confused “as his father leans back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13802">He looks around the fading light of the race track/fairground. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13803">Mr. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13804">Pollard looks at his son for a moment as the C</span><span class="smallcaps"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13805">AMERA</span></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13806"> begins to pull back, rapidly leaving them a small part of the crowd….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13807">Then, they cut to the next scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13808">It’s a small scene but quite an emotional moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13809">The impact on Red is enormous—it is what influences and shapes his life, a life built upon negative self-worth and deep-seated anger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13810">Emotionally, being given away by his parents has led him to believe that he’s not good enough as a person and we see that in his behavior as he lashes out at everyone he is close to.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13811">The Circle of Being event is the source of inner conflict that Red must confront and deal with for the rest of his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13812">He doesn’t feel he deserves anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13813">As the story progresses, we see his internal conflicts about his own self-respect and self-worth.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13814">I feel a Circle of Being event can also apply to animals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13815">As mentioned, I think Seabiscuit is a real character in this movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13816">He was given away at six months, just like Red Pollard, because he did not fit the image of what a racehorse should be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13817">He was taught to lose, not allowed to win a race. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13818">Is it any wonder that he “forgot what it’s like to be a horse”?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13819">Seabiscuit is affected by his real-life Circle of Being event. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13820">The narrator tells us that: “Seabiscuit was the son of Hard Tack, sired by the mighty horse Man O’ War….At six months he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons [who] decided the horse was lazy….Where his sire had been a fierce, almost violent competitor, Seabiscuit took to sleeping for huge chunks of the day and enjoyed lolling for hours under the boughs of the juniper trees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13821">So, they made him a training partner to ‘better’ horses, forcing him to lose head to head to boost the confidence of the other animal….When they finally did race him, he did just what they had trained him to do….He lost….And, of course, it all made sense….Champions were large. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13822">They were sleek. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13823">They were without imperfection. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13824">This horse ran as they had always expected him to run….”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13825">That is the power of the Circle of Being event in your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13826">It can be the source of conflict in the narrative line of action, whether animal or human. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13827">Film is a visual medium—a story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13828">As the ancient text of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13829">Yoga Vashista</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13830"> states, “The world is as you </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13831">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13832"> it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13833">Your story is held together by its characters and conflict and becomes the arena where your character(s) confront the tremendous challenges of the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13834">Conflict and the Circle of Being are the key that ignites the engine and powers your character through the story line.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13870">In one scene, David is driving a rented convertible with the top down along one of those long country roads outside London that are lined with tall trees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13871">The girl, Maria Schneider, is in the passenger seat and she looks over at him and asks, “What are you running from?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13872">He replies by telling her to turn around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13873">She looks behind her and we watch from her point of view as the empty and barren road disappears behind them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13874">The moment holds as we see that he’s leaving his past behind, and moving into an unencumbered present, leading to an unknown and uncertain future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13875">It is cinema at its highest.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13876">When I grasped the realization of that moment, I found it affected me on a deep, and profound, emotional level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13877">No words, only pictures and the coursing recognition that we’re traveling on this road of life carrying our past behind like some unwanted luggage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13878">I’ve often wondered what it would be like if we could simply drop our past and step into the present moment free of time and memory.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13879">When I see a film I like, I respond immediately, on an emotional, intuitive level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13880">Either I like it or I don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13881">Either it works or it doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13882">Oh yes, I can talk endlessly about the visual brilliance of the director, the great performances of the actors, the broad sweep of the photography, the poetry of the editing, or the ingeniousness of the special effects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13883">But when I get right down to it, there’s only one thing that holds the whole thing together—and that’s the story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13884">Ideas, concepts, jargon, and analytical comments don’t really mean a thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13885">Whether the movie proceeds in a straight line, in a circle, or is fractured or splintered into little pieces, doesn’t make a bit of difference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13886">Movies are all about story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13887">No matter who we are, or where we live, or what generation we belong to, the singular aspects of storytelling remain the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13888">It’s been that way since Plato created stories out of the dancing shadows on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13889">The art of telling a story with pictures exists beyond time, culture, and language. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13890">Walk into the Elmira caves in Spain and look at the rock paintings, or into the Accademia Museum in Venice, and gaze upon those magnificent panels depicting the twelve Stations of the Cross, and you enter the grand view of visual storytelling.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13891">There are many filmmakers today who insist that the linear story line—where the story goes from beginning to end in a straight, narrative line—is passé, out of date, not “part of the scene” anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13892">They loudly proclaim that the three-act structure is dead, no longer pertinent to the “modern movie,” whatever that means. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13893">One filmmaker even went on record to state that “the Hollywood narrative film is in its death throes right now and people are looking for something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13894">The whole school of Act I/Act II/Act III is destructive to a thriving, growing cinema.”</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13946">Looking back at how the screenplay has evolved during the last twenty-five years, it’s easy to see that the form of the script has changed considerably. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13947">While screenplays like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13948">Mystic River</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13949"> (Brian Helgeland), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13950">Cinderella Man</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13951"> (Chris Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman), all three parts of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13952">The Lord of the Rings, The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13953"> (Frank Darabont), and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13954">Sideways</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13955"> are all linear story lines, (that is, told from beginning to end in a “straight” story line) there has been a tendency in recent years to create a more novelistic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13956">The novel’s tools, such as stream of consciousness, memories, fantasy, subjective reality, flashbacks, voiceover narration and such, are being used within the framework of the screenplay to create a new form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13957">They’ve been doing this from the beginning of the silent film, of course.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13958">Often, present time merges with memories of the past like in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13959">The English Patient, Cold Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13960">, or the beautiful </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13961">2046</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13962">, almost a meditation on time, love, and memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13963">In essence, it seems we’re trying to communicate a more internal perspective and get closer to the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13964">consciousness</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13965"> of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13966">It is here, in the subjective reality of the character, where the past influences the present and dreams collide with reality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13967">This fusion of time and memory is one of the indicators of what I see as an evolution in the modern screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13968">As of this writing, I think we’re in the middle of a screenwriting revolution, a time where screenwriters are pushing the form in new directions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13969">The traditional way of “seeing things” has changed, and we’re looking for ways to match our experiences and incorporate the new technology at our fingertips.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13970">This revolution/evolution in screenwriting seems to be based upon a new visual awareness of how we see the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13971">Today, the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking is an integral part of our culture and cannot be ignored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13972">Walk into any bookstore and you’ll see shelves and shelves devoted to all aspects of filmmaking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13973">Everybody, it seems, wants to be a filmmaker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13974">Write a script, get a digital video recorder, film the movie, upload it onto your computer, edit it with IPro Edit, or any of the other systems, add some special CGI effects, lay in a soundtrack from a database of music, and you have a film you can then email to your friends and family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13975">Many presentations, both in business and the arts, are now given visually, either on CD or DVD. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13976">With the dramatic rise of computer technology and computer graphic imagery, along with the expanded influence of MTV, reality TV, Xbox, PlayStation, new wireless LAN and Bluetooth technology, and the enormous increase in the number of film festivals both here and abroad, I think we’re in the middle of a cinematic revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13977">Already, we are making short episodic TV series for our cell phones to view during the day or project on TV. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13978">Clearly, we have evolved, and are evolving, in the way we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13979">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13980"> things.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13981">In terms of the screenplay, it seems we’re trying to get closer to the subjective reality of our characters in the same way that the great painters went from the objective world of landscapes and religious figures to the subjective world of the impressionists and abstract expressionism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13982">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13983">The Bourne Supremacy, Kill Bill: Vols. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13984">1 and 2, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Memento, Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13985"> (Patrick Sheane Duncan), the remake of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13986">The Manchurian Candidate</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13987"> (Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris), and others.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13988">Why is this happening? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13989">I think part of it is due to the advancement of digital film technology, which has changed and influenced the way we see and interpret our experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13990">Most films coming out of Hollywood are as pretty as cotton candy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13991">They may look like they’re about something, but there’s nothing there but sugar and water. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13992">There’s no content. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-13993">As Gertrude Stein once remarked about Oakland many years ago, “there ain’t no there when you get there.”</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14083">I asked about his background. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14084">The son of writer-director Frank D. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14085">Gilroy, he grew up in upstate New York and originally started out as a musician. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14086">He played in a lot of bands, got involved in songwriting, and told me he “just got tired of playing music.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14087">He moved to New York and began writing short stories, moved on to writing a novel, and “fell in love with writing prose.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14088">When his brother, Dan, also a screenwriter, graduated from college, “he optioned a book that he was turning into a script and it looked like there was some interest in it,” Gilroy said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14089">“I had stopped playing music, and thought, well, I’m not going to finish this novel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14090">I’m going to write a screenplay and make some dough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14091">Quick. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14092">Then I’ll go back and finish this book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14093">So I spent the next 5 years tending bar while I learned how to write a screenplay and fell in love with the form of it.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14094">“I learned a lot of things from music,” Gilroy continues. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14095">“I don’t read music, but making music in the recording studio and the process of recording music and rehearsing with bands and making arrangements of songs, basically just how you think about songs, seems to always be the same creative process.”</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14133">Tony Gilroy approached this in two ways. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14134">At the end of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14135">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14136">, Jason tracks Marie down in Greece and the film ends with them together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14137">So, the first question Gilroy had to ask himself was, what happened to Bourne and Marie during the intervening years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14138">“Where would they have gone?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14139">he asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14140">“And what would be happening to them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14141">I thought the honeymoon would probably be over because he had escaped without really paying the emotional price of that relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14142">Being with Marie was easy so I felt there was a lot of unfinished psychological business with Jason Bourne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14143">I was sure the audience would want to know how much he was going to remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14144">And we had left that open. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14145">So I wanted to define for myself what might’ve happened to them on the run.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14146">“First, I wanted to find a location where they would go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14147">Bourne would be looking for a place that was ‘safe’—isolated, off the beaten track, but someplace where they might have a chance of blending in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14148">So I started looking for places which were out of the way, where people hadn’t shot too many movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14149">Finally, I found Goa, in India, and I thought that was really cool.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14150">“Once I had the location, then I could start sketching scenes for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14151">Long scenes, just getting them talking to see what might happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14152">They’d come together so quickly, and now their time together had been on the run, with Bourne constantly looking over his shoulder, I thought they’d probably be unhappy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14153">What would happen if the headaches had gotten worse? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14154">What happens if his paranoia has really started to wear on her? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14155">What would the reality be for a relationship like theirs?”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14156">That’s all he had to start with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14157">Not much in terms of story except a character on the run who happens to have amnesia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14158">“So, what’s going to happen?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14159">Gilroy asks rhetorically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14160">“As far as the story goes, I’m back to square one: What kind of a movie is this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14161">Intuitively, I felt I didn’t want to drag Marie through this story line because I had already done that in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14162">The Bourne Identity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14163">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14164">I thought the best thing to do would be to kill her off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14165">That way there’d be no chance of repeating the first film.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14183">How did he resolve this story issue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14184">I asked. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14185">He replied, “In the novel, which takes place in Communist China, there was a doppelganger [a double, or mirror image of someone] impersonating Jason Bourne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14186">I thought maybe I could use that—maybe someone </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14187">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14188"> impersonating him? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14189">But why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14190">And if I have them kill Marie and then have Bourne seeking to avenge her death, will this just become another revenge picture? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14191">If it is, what happens? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14192">I started wondering why someone would be impersonating him when he’s with Marie in Goa.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14240">I thought about this as I was studying the screenplay and I began to see that this thematic overview drives the entire narrative line of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14241">It is the foundation of the key incident (the killing of Neski in Berlin) that is now woven throughout the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14242">Once this key incident had been determined, it becomes the structural point to build and to anchor the rest of the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14243">In the end, Bourne travels to Moscow to apologize to Neski’s daughter, thus atoning for his sins.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14244">At this point, Gilroy said, he had to make some distinctions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14245">First, the agents from Treadstone, the secret CIA assassination squad, were like “soldiers and their assignments were specific and precise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14246">That was the distinction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14247">The people that Treadstone killed were also ‘soldiers’ of some sort or another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14248">But Neski’s wife was collateral damage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14249">She wasn’t supposed to be there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14250">And Bourne’s improvised solution to this—the murder-suicide—added a whole other dimension to the tragedy of it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14251">Gilroy continued. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14252">“I’ve known a few people who are the children of suicide and it’s a shadow that follows them always. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14253">There were, no doubt, many people that Jason Bourne could find to apologize to, but this Neski construction came about because I needed the apology to have some possibility of hope to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14254">It needed to be more than just, ‘I’m sorry.’</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14255">“I wanted him to actually </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14256">give</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14257"> something, so it wasn’t just some selfish grab for atonement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14258">And Bourne knows that if he can find their daughter, he can at least make one thing better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14259">And when I understood that, I jumped to the end and sketched that final scene, which came very, very quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14260">It felt locked in—solid from the first pass. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14261">I knew I had the ultimate landmark to navigate the film toward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14262">And that’s when the whole movie opened up.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14263">I asked Gilroy how he structured the sequence in Berlin in terms of Bourne’s memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14264">I know that in my own life I’ve had similar experiences where something happened a long, long time ago and I had no recollection of the incident or, at best, only a vague, fleeting image of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14265">Then, one day, I would find myself in a certain, similar situation and suddenly remember a tiny piece of fragmented memory of what happened at that particular time or place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14266">Memory stirs something buried so deep that it can be stimulated either by a situation, a line of dialogue, or even the tea leaves left at the bottom of the cup, like Marcel Proust in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14267">Remembrance of Things Past</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14268">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14606">It’s up to you to decide what you want to show, and only then can you figure out how to show it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14607">But for right now it’s important for you to define it and describe it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14608">How do you go about structuring Act I?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14609">First, we want to create the content in such a way that it can be anchored within the context of Act I, the Set-Up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14610">There are several ways to do this: sitting at the computer describing each scene in a few words, or outlining various scenes on a legal pad, or laying out a beat sheet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14611">What I caution against doing is simply creating a list of scenes they want to write in a numerical order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14612">It may work for some people but I try to keep the writing process as open in idea and content as possible, so for me, that doesn’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14613">It’s too limiting and there’s not much flexibility.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14614">I like to be flexible because I want to be able to change and manipulate the scenes I’m writing, especially in this part of the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14615">So I use cards to outline each scene, 3 × 5 cards to be specific, though any size will do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14616">Over the years I’ve learned that fourteen cards work best, and if you write one scene per card (though that’s a contradiction which will be explained later), you can lay out the content of Act I, from the opening scene or sequence to the plot point at the end of Act I.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14617">People ask “why fourteen cards? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14618">Can’t I have twelve or sixteen or seventeen?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14619">My response is based on my own experience—when I look at the cards, I can tell whether there’s too much material for the Act, or whether there’s not enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14620">If a writer is laying out the structure of Act I and has only thirteen cards it’s typically not enough to set up the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14621">And, if you have fifteen cards it’s usually too much material for Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14622">Fourteen cards just work; it’s an effective tool for structuring Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14623">If you don’t believe me, try it and see what happens.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14779">An effective back story can influence the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14780">Look at the opening sequence of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14781">The Shawshank Redemption:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14782"> Andy Dufresne is sitting in a car drinking, pulls out a gun, tries to load it as he slugs down a bottle of whiskey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14783">He gets out of the car, then staggers toward the house, gun in hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14784">What do you think the back story would be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14785">Probably when he found out his wife was having an affair with a tennis pro. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14786">It’s an event that impacts the main character and sets up the inciting incident that opens the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14787">He intends to kill his wife and her lover and it is this scene that sets the story in motion.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14788">In a screenplay, you’ve got to grab the reader immediately, from page one, word one, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14789">The Royal Tenenbaums, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14790">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14791">Body Heat</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14792">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14793">You don’t have time to find out what that first scene is about; you’ve got to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14794">know</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14795"> what it’s about.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14797">The back story helps you jump into your script from the Fade In. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14798">It generates a strong sense of dramatic or comedic tension immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14799">So what happens to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14800">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14801"> character, a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14802">What incident, episode, or event is working on your character when the story begins?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14803">Suppose your script opens with your main character arriving at work on Monday morning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14804">The back story might be that on Friday afternoon your character went to his or her boss and asked for a raise and the boss said no.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14805">Your character goes home and suffers through a long weekend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14806">You can imagine what your character is thinking or feeling before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14807">Then you open your script on a Monday morning as your character arrives at work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14808">Imagine her getting off the elevator: Is she grim and tight-lipped, or jocular and carefree? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14809">Or is she wearing a cool and personable demeanor, showing her associates at work that everything is okay, but it’s only a mask because underneath that façade are the seeds of anger, resentment, and low self-worth bubbling up to the surface. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14810">And somewhere along the line they’re going to erupt.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14811">That’s the force of a good back story; it allows you to enter the action from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14812">This way, you know the purpose of the opening scene so you don’t have to go “searching” for it, trying to figure out what’s going to happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14813">That opening scene or sequence always seems to be the most difficult to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14814">Knowing your back story can help you achieve the maximum dramatic value from the very first page of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14815">One of my students was writing a story about a stage director preparing her first theatrical production off-Broadway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14816">My student was having difficulty defining the emotional state of her main character and didn’t know where or how to open her story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14817">Should she open at a rehearsal or opening night? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14818">Every time she sketched the opening, it was wordy, expository, filled with unnecessary dialogue and meaningless conflict.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14819">She didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14820">I told her to write up a back story and include something in the main character’s marriage that might influence the action of the play within the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14821">When I asked her what the story of the play her character was directing was about, she didn’t know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14822">Well, I said, if she didn’t know, who did?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14823">So she went home and wrote up a character essay about the relationship of the main character to her husband—where they met, how long they’d been married, and the emotional forces that might be working on the main character when the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14824">Then she wrote up a back story, which literally opened up the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14825">What she “found” in her back story was this: the marriage was in trouble and the main character’s husband wanted to start a family, but she wasn’t ready for that step. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14826">Her career was just getting off the ground and she was afraid she would lose this opportunity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14827">When the chance came for her to direct the off-Broadway play, she jumped at it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14828">Her husband became jealous and resentful, and the gap between the main character and husband grew wider.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14829">The back story takes place about a week before the play’s opening (the opening night was Plot Point I) and she knows it’s just not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14830">Tense and frustrated, the director gets into “another argument” with her husband about starting a family just before the final week of rehearsals begin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14831">Angry and upset, she storms out of the apartment and jumps onto the subway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14832">As she makes her way uptown, she gets an insight into why the play isn’t working and understands what she has to do to fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14833">She races to the theater to meet the actors in rehearsal.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14834">That was the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14835">Now, my student opened her screenplay with the main character getting off the subway and rushing to the rehearsal with a newfound awareness.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14836">The back story allowed her to open her screenplay with strong dramatic tension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14837">She was able to “leap” into her story line from the opening shot and didn’t have to search for her story in the first few scenes of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14838">She went from not knowing how the story opened to knowing exactly what she had to do to open it dramatically, effectively, and visually.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14839">If your screenplay has a “play within a play,” like a radio show, a soap opera, a play, or a movie, you must be able to describe its premise in a few sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14840">That way, you can structure a progression of the story within the story to emotionally influence the main character’s dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14841">This is especially true if you’re writing a nonlinear screenplay like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14842">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14843"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14844">The Hours</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14845">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14846">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14847">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14848">, you have two stories moving the story forward: the one in the past, the love story between Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas), and the one in the present, when Almásy is wounded and swathed in bandages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14849">Both stories are structured linearly, from beginning to end, with parts of each interwoven into a continuous narrative line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14850">That’s how the back story can help you design the first scene or sequence so you begin your screenplay from page one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14851">What happens to your main character a day, a week, or an hour before your story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14852">Remember, you’ve only got about ten pages to grab your reader.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14853">Sometimes you’ll discover that you like the back story so much that you want to open your screenplay with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14854">That’s fine, but if you do this you still need to write another back story to lead into your new opening scene with a sense of strong dramatic tension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14855">And there are times when the writer writes one back story, likes it, then writes another one, likes that one, then writes another back story, and soon the original opening of the script becomes the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14856">If that happens, just go with it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14857">Structure is flexible, it’s like a tree in the wind that bends but does not break.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14858">So, if that happens and you decide to open your screenplay with what was once one or several back stories, just write up another back story so you’ll always know where your character is coming from. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14859">Actors do this all the time; before an actor enters a scene he has to know were he’s coming from, what the purpose of the scene is, and where they’re going when the scene is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14860">That’s just good preparation.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14861">Do the same with the back story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14862">Sometimes the back story will become part of the screenplay, sometimes not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14863">It depends on the individual script.</span></p>

				<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14865">Act I is a unit of dramatic action between twenty and thirty pages long that is held together with the dramatic context known as the Set-Up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14866">Remember, you are setting up your story, your characters, and the relationship between the characters.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14867">Then structure the action of Act I on fourteen 3 × 5 cards.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14868">You already know the opening scene or sequence and the Plot Point at the end of Act I, so you know card number one and card fourteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14869">Start at the beginning of your story and move through the action leading to the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14870">Free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14871">You know where you’re going, so all you have to do is get there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14872">Lay the story line out on cards, one scene or sequence per card, using no more than a few words on each card. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14873">When you’ve completed the cards, read them over and over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14874">Don’t change anything until you feel the “urge” to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14875">Then, if you like, change a word here or there, just to make the cards read smoothly and simply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14876">Describe the story line in broad and general strokes.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14877">After you’ve done the cards, write up the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14878">Remember, it will influence the action of the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14879">Look at your opening scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14880">Where does it take place? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14881">Describe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14882">Define it.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14883">When the script opens, where is your character coming from? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14884">What has happened to him or her a day, a week, or an hour before the story begins?</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14885">Just free-associate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14886">Lay it out, regardless of grammar or punctuation or any plot holes you may have. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14887">You might also need to lay out the back story in terms of beginning, middle, and end, or even have to write up a character essay in order to feel comfortable about the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14888">Do whatever needs to be done, because if you don’t know the story, who does? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14889">The back story can usually be written in a couple of pages, but if you need more, use them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14890">It doesn’t matter how long or how short it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14891">The back story is a tool in the screenwriting process, one of the many that lead to a dynamic and forceful opening.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14918">I began to see what Jean Renoir had pointed out to me so many times before: writing for the screen is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14919">To write a good screenplay, you have to tell the story in pictures, not words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14920">As I was learning, the art of screenwriting is in finding places where silence works better than words.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14921">Of the more than two thousand screenplays I read, I found only forty worth submitting to our financial partners for possible production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14922">Why so few? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14923">As a writer taking a much-needed break from screenwriting, I was curious as to what made these screenplays better than all the others I had read.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14924">Over the next few years, I watched as studios and producers picked up many of the scripts I had found and made them into movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14925">Of those forty scripts I had selected, some thirty-seven films eventually were made, including classics like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14926">The Godfather</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14927"> (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14928">American Graffiti</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14929"> (George Lucas), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14930">Jeremiah Johnson</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14931"> (John Milius, Edward Anhalt, and David Rayfiel), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14932">Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14933"> (Robert Getchell), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14934">The Wind and the Lion</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14935"> (John Milius), and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14936">Taxi Driver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14937"> (Paul Schrader), along with many others.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14942">While I was still in this observational mode, I was given the opportunity to teach a screenwriting course at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14943">I had never taught any kind of a class before and the memories I had of my own teachers were not very flattering. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14944">The only effective models I had as teachers were Jean Renoir and one of my English professors at Berkeley during the ’60’s—they were teachers who sparked my desire to learn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14945">And I remembered something Renoir had once said, that a good teacher is someone who teaches the student to see the relationship between things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14946">Could I do that? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14947">Did I want to do that? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14948">And the bigger question: What would I teach and how would I go about doing it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14949">The only thing I could do, I realized, was to go into my own writing and reading experience and share my observations about the craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14950">What did I look for as a reader? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14951">First, I noticed the style of writing—whether it was active, written in present tense, with terse, visual descriptions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14952">The style had to be established from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14953">For example, here’s a brief description of a run-down building that is a good illustration of a strong, active, visual style: “Bright sun beating through holes in a rusted tin roof. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14954">The dirt floor has been dug up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14955">A deep hole, lined with plastic sheeting has been unearthed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14956">There’s a FOOTLOCKER open to one side.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14957">That kind of visual description grabs my attention immediately.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14958">The next thing I learned is that as a reader, I have to know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14959">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14960"> the story is about in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14961">What is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14962">dramatic premise?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14963"> It could be as simple as the phony Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14964">Mulwray’s line in the first few pages of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14965">Chinatown:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14966"> “My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14967">The answer to that question, of course, results in the uncovering of a huge water scandal and several murders.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14968">I also needed to know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14969">who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14970"> the story is about. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14971">Who</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14972"> is the main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14973">Then I can determine whether the action and characters have been “set up” within the first few pages and a strong dramatic context established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14974">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14975">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14976">, Jake Gittes is clearly the man in charge.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14977">The third thing that has to be established is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14978">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14979">, the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14980">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14981">Chinatown</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14982">, the dramatic situation is shown and talked about within the first ten pages: Los Angeles is in the middle of a severe drought and water has become a scarce commodity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14983">Jake Gittes is a private investigator hired by the wife of a prominent man suspected of having an affair, and her husband is the head of the Water and Power Department of Los Angeles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14984">All three things: main character, dramatic premise, and dramatic situation are related and set up the story within these first ten pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14985">It wasn’t too long before I discovered that I could tell whether or not a script was working within the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-14986">If I didn’t know what was going on during that unit of action, I found my interest wandering and I began to look for ways to stop reading.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15152">There’s a good screenwriting tool that may help guide you when you’re writing the scene: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15153">entering late and getting out early</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15154">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15155">William Goldman, the brilliant screenwriter of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15156">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Princess Bride</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15157">, and numerous others, tells a story about where and when to enter a scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15158">Goldman sets up a hypothetical situation: a reporter is interviewing a subject for a newspaper or magazine article. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15159">The beginning shows the reporter preparing for the interview and arriving at the location; the middle has him greeting the subject, getting comfortable, taking out his or her tape recorder, and beginning the interview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15160">The ending is concluding the interview, packing up, thanking the subject, putting on his or her coat, walking to the door, then suddenly remembering something, turning around and saying: “Oh, by the way—one last question.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15161">That’s the beginning, middle, and end of this hypothetical scene.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15203">The opening of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15204">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15205"> (Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens), is a good example; the first few pages set up the history of the Ring; we see it forged in the fires of Mount Doom, see the struggle of good and evil played out, then learn that it must be destroyed at its place of creation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15206">Once this is established, we cut to Gandalf arriving at Middle-Earth and the story begins to unfold.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15207">The script opens with an action sequence which is the inciting incident, and hear a voiceover narration spoken by Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) wherein we introduce the history of the Ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15208">“It began with the forging of the Great Rings….Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest—fairest of all beings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15209">Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15210">And Nine…nine rings were gifted to the race of Men who, above all else, desire power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15211">For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15212">But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made….In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others….And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15213">One Ring to rule them all…”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15214">During this opening battle for the Ring, the inciting incident occurs: the Ring is lost, then found on page 5, “by the most unlikely creature imaginable…A Hobbit—Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15215">We meet the creature, Gollum, anguishing over the loss of his “precious” and we learn on page 6 that “the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15216">In the next scene, we enter the Shire as Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives and is greeted by Frodo (Elijah Wood). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15217">He then visits Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), and on page 10, Bilbo tells Gandalf how weary he is: “I feel it in my heart,” Bilbo says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15218">“I need a holiday—a very long holiday and I don’t expect I shall return—in fact, I mean not to.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15219">Look at what we’ve learned in these first ten pages: we’ve established the history of the Ring, introduced Gollum, showed how Bilbo found the Ring, met two of the main characters (Gandalf and Frodo), and been introduced to life in the Shire as Bilbo reveals the Ring to Gandalf and tells him of his intention to disappear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15220">We’ve set up everything we need to know to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15221">It is lean, clean, and tight, visually designed to grab the attention of the reader and audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15222">And it works marvelously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15223">This entire unit of action, the first ten pages, is what sets up all three episodes of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15224">The Lord of the Rings</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15225">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15234">Another good example of an opening scene is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15235">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15236">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15237">We are on the deck of an aircraft carrier, and watch as military jet planes take off, then cut to newsreel footage of Russian rebels taking over the Kremlin and threatening a nuclear strike on the United States. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15238">Then we pull back from a television screen into a birthday party for Lt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15239">Commander Ron Hunter’s (Denzel Washington) four-year-old daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15240">It is a scene that exploits the situation and reveals character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15241">It’s a very visual sequence, and a great example of an inciting incident.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15242">Whether you’re writing a comedy or drama or thriller or love story makes no difference at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15243">The form remains constant. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15244">Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15245"> opens up with a monologue by Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) telling us that he and Annie (Diane Keaton) have ended their relationship and how he “keeps sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind….” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15246">That, really, is the whole film, since those “pieces of the relationship” are then told in flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15247">It’s all set up on the first page of the screenplay.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15259">On page 6, we see him in his law office with an elderly client; Racine had sent her to a doctor who will not testify on her behalf, so he tells her he will find a “more understanding” doctor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15260">“We’ll sue those reckless bastards dry,” he adds.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15261">Later, on page 7, it’s night and he’s bored. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15262">He has a drink at the bar, then wanders over to the beachfront bandstand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15263">He listens to the music, sees Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), “this extraordinary, beautiful woman,” walking toward him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15264">“She passes within a few inches of him….Racine’s body sways a moment as she goes by as though buffeted by some force.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15265">He follows her, and during their conversation she tells him she is a married woman; he replies that she should have said, “I’m a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15266">happily</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15267"> married woman.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15268">She sizes him up and says, “You’re not too smart, are you?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15269">Then, as an afterthought, “I like that in a man.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15270">He remarks that she looks “well tended,” then adds, “I need tending, but only for the night.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15271">Racine’s the type of person, we learn, “whose dick gets him into trouble.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15272">When Matty spills a cherry Sno-Kone on her blouse, he gets some paper towels, but when he returns she’s gone, vanished into the night.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15273">These pages are very good illustrations of a well-designed opening.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15274">You can see how important the first ten pages of the screenplay are in terms of setting up the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15275">They need to be conceived, designed, and executed for maximum dramatic value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15276">If you set these pages up correctly, the story can unfold properly, with simplicity, insight, and understanding.</span></p>

				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15609">Tell your story, showing what is necessary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15610">If you’re writing a scene and something really “good” happens, something unexpected, something you hadn’t thought about before, just go with it and write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15611">Don’t get in the way, just let it happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15612">The worst that can happen is you write some pages that don’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15613">So what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15614">Don’t save it for a later time or another scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15615">Write it.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15616">Don’t worry about not having enough to say! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15617">I tell my students that if you’re working full time and writing “on the side,” ten pages is a good solid week’s work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15618">Think through the action for a couple of days, then sit down to write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15619">Think in terms of writing the script in sections, in units of dramatic action, and you’ll feel more comfortable with the process.</span></p>

				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15661">You’re going to rewrite 70 to 80 percent of what you’ve written anyway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15662">When you’ve completed Act II and Act III, you’ll know exactly what you have to do when you start the rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15663">Don’t worry about that now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15664">Just write your pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15665">When you complete the third ten pages you’re ready to move into Act II.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15930">It seemed to make sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-15931">And the more films I saw, the more scripts I read, and the more I thought about it, I began to see there was definitely some kind of incident that occurred in the middle of Act II that could be used as an anchoring point to organize and structure the action throughout the Second Act.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16138">It was about this time that I was approached by two Belgian filmmakers, representatives of the Ministry of Dutch Culture, who asked me to teach a special screenwriting workshop in Brussels that summer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16139">During our discussion, one of them asked if I had discovered anything new, in terms of structure, since the publication of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16140">Screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16141"> a few years earlier. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16142">I told him about the Mid-Point and how I was beginning to incorporate the material in my screenplays and workshops.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16162">I put down the script, and he saw the confusion in my face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16163">“Is that the Mid-Point?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16164">the filmmaker asked. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16165">And if it is, why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16166">I looked at him and tried to justify the scene as the Mid-Point, then gave it up because it was obvious I didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16167">The truth was that I didn’t know if that was the Mid-Point or not, and if it was, why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16168">I tried to laugh it off, and quickly changed the subject.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16183">One overcast Saturday morning, at the Palais des Beaux Arts, I showed the film to several European filmmakers, and after the screening we sat around and discussed it in front of a large audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16184">I started talking about the Mid-Point, and how it starts the connection between Hollis Mulwray, Jake Gittes, and Mrs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16185">Mulwray. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16186">In the scene, Gittes wants some information from Yelburton, the new head of the Department of Water and Power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16187">The secretary tells him that Yelburton is in a meeting and will be tied up indefinitely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16188">“I’ll wait,” Gittes says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16189">He lights up a cigarette, plops down in the chair, and makes himself at home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16190">“I take a long lunch,” he mentions to the secretary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16191">“All day, sometimes.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16192">He starts humming to himself, and the secretary gets nervous and edgy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16193">Then, he gets up and prowls along the wall, looking at the photographs that detail the history of the department. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16194">There are several photographs of Hollis Mulwray and a man named Noah Cross (John Huston) standing together at various construction sites.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16195">Cross. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16196">The name rings a bell to Gittes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16197">He takes out Evelyn Mulwray’s envelope and looks at the monogram: ECM. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16198">He asks the secretary if Noah Cross worked for the water department. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16199">Flustered, the secretary says yes, then no. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16200">“Noah Cross </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16201">owned</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16202"> the water department,” she tells him, “along with Mulwray.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16203">They were partners, she explains. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16204">Mulwray felt the public should own the water but Cross didn’t agree, and they had a falling out.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16205">Something clicks for Gittes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16206">Evelyn Mulwray is Noah Cross’ daughter; that means she married her father’s business partner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16207">Whose side is Evelyn on—her father’s or her dead husband’s? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16208">Suddenly Gittes realizes that Noah Cross could have a very strong motive for killing Hollis Mulwray.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16209">Now things start to make sense; the information is a vital link in the dramatic action of Act II, and the first clue that points to the solution of the puzzle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16210">Ultimately it leads to Gittes proving that Cross is the man responsible for the murders and the water scandal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16211">It is a link in the chain of dramatic action, an essential clue to Gittes understanding of what’s going on.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16467">Once you establish that, you can move forward into the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16468">You know the Mid-Point and you know Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16469">What is the theme of action that keeps the story moving forward to Plot Point II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16470">That’s your sub-dramatic context. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16471">Write it down on the paradigm. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16472">Next, determine Pinch II, that sequence that keeps the story on track heading toward Plot Point II.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16488">Go over and over the cards until they feel comfortable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16489">Remember that the essence of Act II is conflict, so seek out those conflicts, either internal or external, whenever and wherever you can. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16490">And remember, the purpose of each scene is to either move the story forward or reveal information about the character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16491">If you get lost somewhere in the creative maze that is Act II, you could spend days, perhaps weeks, in frustration and despair trying to find your way out of the pit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16492">But as you’re writing Act II, you have to understand that you have no objectivity at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16493">If you doubt yourself in terms or the material, you’ll start censoring everything, and you won’t be able to write anything! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16494">If you don’t watch out, that’s when you’ll become your own victim and start to experience writer’s block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16495">Don’t let that happen.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16496">Keep writing no matter how you feel about it, whether you think it’s good, bad, or indifferent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16497">Just write your story, page by page, scene by scene, shot by shot, and leave all your judgments and evaluations in the nightstand drawer next to your bed.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16498">Breaking Act II into the First and Second Half, then establishing the sub-dramatic context and time frame, then Pinch I and Pinch II, allows you to gain a structural overview that keeps your story on track. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16499">It will guide you through the obstacle course that leads to the next step in the screenwriting process—the actual writing of Act II.</span></p>

				<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16502">Let’s do the following exercise as a “tune-up.”</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16503">Look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16504">paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16505"> (on the previous page): we have a story about a young woman in an unhappy marriage who enrolls in an art class and ends up having an affair with her teacher.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16506">The way it’s broken down and structured is the same way we structure all our exercises: we choose the ending first, the beginning next, then Plot Points I and II, then the Mid-Point, then the time frame, then we establish the sub-dramatic context for the First Half of Act II, than the sub-dramatic context for the Second Half, and only then do we determine Pinches I and II.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16507">In Act I, we set up our story by establishing the unhappy marriage of our main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16508">Plot Point I is when she enrolls in the art class.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16509">Since we know she’s going to have an affair with the teacher, and become pregnant at Plot Point II, the Mid-Point would be when she has sex with him for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16510">In that way, the First Half is where we see her juggling her art class, her painting, and her marriage, as well as her feelings about herself as she gets to know the teacher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16511">The sub-dramatic context of this First Half of Act II would focus on establishing the relationship between her and her teacher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16512">The sub-dramatic context of the Second Half of Act II deals with her falling in love with her teacher.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16513">Take another look at it on the paradigm.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16514">Go over the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16515">What incident, episode, or event do you think Pinch I is?</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16516">Let’s look at the possibilities: It might be where the young woman and the teacher have an opportunity to get to know each other for the first time on a one-to-one basis. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16517">Maybe she wants an appraisal of her work and they go out for coffee after class; or her car won’t start in the parking lot and she borrows his cell phone; or he gives her a ride home and they decide they like each other; or they meet at a party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16518">Any such situation will work as Pinch I.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16519">Our character is not about to jump right into bed with her teacher, no matter how unhappy she might be with her husband. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16520">She is cautious, and her actions will be appropriate to the circumstances. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16521">Otherwise, we don’t have any sympathy for her, and your main character must always be sympathetic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16522">And what about the teacher? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16523">Who is he? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16524">What kind of person is he? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16525">You would do a character biography on him just to see what kind of a person he is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16526">Student and teacher would spend time together getting to know each other, which we could show, and then, at Mid-Point, they have sex for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16527">That gives you about fifteen pages of script to visually reveal their relationship.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16528">During the Second Half of Act II the student falls in love with the teacher, leading us to Plot Point II, where she discovers she’s pregnant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16529">It could be a scene in a doctor’s office, or the results of a pregnancy test. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16530">If they have an intense and passionate scene making love, this might be the scene where she conceives.</span></p>

				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16546">I know what I would do: Pinch II would be where she first misses her period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16547">That incident sets up choices: is she pregnant? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16548">Finding out leads her to her choices: have an abortion; tell her husband about it; leave her husband; leave both husband and lover and have the baby on her own and start life over again as a single person, mother, and painter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16549">Or, does she want to start a new life with the teacher? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16550">In other words, how does she resolve her dilemma in Act III?</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16579">Has your character’s dramatic need changed at Plot Point I? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16580">Remember, if your character’s dramatic need changes, it will change at Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16581">That is the true beginning of your story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16582">During the preparation of Act II, did you think about what obstacles your character might confront during this course of narrative action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16583">Preparing to write Act II means that you need to know approximately four major obstacles that your character confronts to get through the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-16584">As with all obstacles, they can either be internal or external, physical or emotional, mental or spiritual.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17566">As you sit down at the computer, writing pad, or typewriter, and engage in the creative process of resolving your story line, you may find that things will be going smoothly and easily until the last few pages of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17567">Then you might feel strange, find yourself suddenly going “blank,” not knowing what to write or feeling that you have no real desire or enthusiasm or ambition to complete the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17568">You’ll look for, and find, every excuse you can to avoid writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17569">It’s really very funny; after weeks and months of preparation, research, commitment, pain, toil, and trouble, after weeks of self-doubt, fears, and insecurities, after weeks of working your ass off, you may suddenly want to chuck it, with only a few pages to write.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17570">It’s absurd; you really can’t take it too seriously.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17571">What do you do?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17572">First of all, this seems to be a somewhat common experience among writers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17573">It originates below the level of awareness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17574">Every writer I know, including myself, experiences this phenomenon. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17575">Emotionally</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17576">, you don’t want to end the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17577">You want to hang on, not finish it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17578">It’s like a terrible relationship—no matter how bad it is, it’s better than no relationship at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17579">The same principle applies to writing your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17580">It’s hard to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17581">It’s been a great part of your life; you think about it every day, your characters are like friends, you talk about your story every chance you get. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17582">Writing it has kept you awake at night, caused you pain and suffering, and given you great satisfaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17583">Of course you don’t want to give it up!</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17584">For what?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17585">It’s only natural to want “to hold on.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17586">I hate to spoil your illusions, but there’s a lot of work left to do on this screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17587">When you finish this first words-on-paper draft, you’re only a third of the way through the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17588">You’re not done with anything; the ending of one thing is always the beginning of something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17589">You’ve got two more drafts to go before you complete this first-draft screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17590">Just finish your script; resolve it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17591">And once you write the final “Fade Out” give yourself a little pat on the back and celebrate with a glass of wine, or champagne, or whatever suits your disposition.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17592">Put your screenplay on the desk in front of you and see how many pages you’ve written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17593">Pick it up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17594">Feel it.</span></p>

				<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17600">Isolate the two or three dramatic elements of Act III that resolve your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17601">Take a look at your cards for Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17602">Do they still work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17603">Do you need to change them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17604">If need be, restructure Act III on fourteen new 3 × 5 cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17605">Then go over and over them.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17606">When you feel comfortable with your material, start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17607">You may begin to experience some resistance at this point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17608">Many times, in my own experience, I come up with a new idea, so compelling and powerful that I want to stop what I’m doing and just jump into the new idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17609">Don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17610">Take out a notebook or a piece of paper and simply write it down in two or three pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17611">Write as much as you want about the idea, then put it away and go back to completing Act III.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17612">If you experience any resistance, doubts, or judgments, or feel that you’re “burnt out,” just “bend with it” and acknowledge it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17613">Continue writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17614">Always keep your resolution—the solution—firmly in mind.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17615">If you want to change any of the details of the ending, do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17616">If your ending comes out different from what you want it to be, write it one way, put it away in a drawer somewhere, and then write it again; this time it will be the way you want it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17617">If you’re writing a comedy and it comes out serious and dramatic, write it down, stick it in a drawer, and then write it as a comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17618">The same with a drama; if it comes out funny, continue to write, knowing it’s only a form of resistance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17619">When you’ve finished and it’s out of your head and out of your system, stick it in a drawer somewhere and forget about it, then go back and write it the way you want to.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17620">What’s important is to create a resolution that is honest and entrenched in the integrity of your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17621">If you try to figure out what “they” want, what you think the public would like, or what the production companies would like to see in order to sell your material, forget it; it’ll never work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17622">There’s no way you can “figure” out what “they” want. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17623">Just write your screenplay from the position that this is your screenplay and this is how the story is resolved and this is the ending you have chosen for now.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17624">It can always be changed later—when you do the rewrite.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17638">I knew it was a line for a song. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17639">He reached into my glove compartment, pulled out an old envelope, grabbed a pen, wrote down the line, added a few more words, hummed a musical phrase, and in that moment the entire song came to him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17640">It took him only a few minutes to write down the lyrics.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17641">When we got back to my house, he sat down at the piano and began to play various phrases tying it all together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17642">About 10 minutes later he said “listen to this” and he played the song’s musical line for me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17643">It sounded good, even though it was rough and somewhat sketchy.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17644">Several days later he called and invited me to meet him at a recording studio in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17645">He was going to record the song, he told me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17646">As I walked into the studio, I saw a huge orchestra on the stage, a number of backup singers, and a major recording artist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17647">They started their rehearsals, and I heard the full song performed for the first time.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17648">Needless to say, I was blown away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17649">From a few scribbled lines on an old envelope to this intense musical experience within the space of a little more than a week! </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17650">I couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17651">I was jealous as hell; I wished I could write a screenplay or a book like that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17652">I left the studio filled with a sense of wonder mingled with a layer of personal resentment and a lot of self-pity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17653">When I think of the hours, the days, the weeks, the months, and in some cases, the years, of arduous and tedious work that goes into writing a screenplay or a book, it’s no wonder I felt the way I did.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17654">I wished I could write a screenplay that way, but it’s not to be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17655">Oh sure, I’ve heard stories of screenwriters who write a script in a week, or two, and they may all be true—but what you don’t hear is how long they must have worked on the idea and characters and plot before they sat down to actually write the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17656">That musical experience with my friend haunted me because I was measuring his experience of writing that one particular song against my own experience of writing a screenplay or book. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17657">And I knew there was no way I could measure his songwriting experience against my own writing experience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17658">The more I thought about it, the more I saw that writing a screenplay is composed of many individual stages and they’re all different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17659">Each phase is totally separate and unique. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17660">You may get a flash of inspiration for a screenplay in a few moments, but executing it is a quite different story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17661">Writing is a detailed, step-by-step process, a day-by-day progression, and you move through it in stages, making it better and more complete as you go along.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17662">It’s only natural. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17663">Science teaches us that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17664">The scientific method since the time of Francis Bacon deals with measuring things or making tests which involve experimentation and measurable results. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17665">A scientist will try different things, exploring each possible alternative intelligently and systematically, always keeping a record of what works and discarding what doesn’t.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17666">So many people I talk to share with me that they don’t like the idea of having to rewrite their material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17667">After all, they’ve spent many months working on this first words-on-paper draft and feel that any changes that may need to be made should be authorized by someone who is going to buy or produce the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17668">In other words, they should be paid for rewriting the material.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17669">Nothing could be farther from the truth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17670">The old adage “writing is rewriting” is a truism, like it or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17671">Rewriting your screenplay is a necessary and essential part of the screenwriting process; it corrects the changes you might have made during the first words-on-paper draft, and clarifies and defines your story as well as sharpening your characters and situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17672">You want your screenplay to be the best that you can make it—otherwise why spend all this time writing it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17673">It would be easier not to do it at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17674">Whether you like the idea of rewriting or not, at some point you’re going to have to do it; you can’t argue with it, you don’t need to fight it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17675">Just accept it because that’s just the way it is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17676">Nobody ever told you that writing a screenplay was going to be easy.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17677">When you complete your first words-on-paper draft you know you’re going to have to make changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17678">That’s a given. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17679">Your screenplay is a living thing and it changes and grows from day to day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17680">It is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17681">process</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17682">, and what you write today may be out of date tomorrow and what you write tomorrow may be out of date the day after the day after tomorrow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17683">Don’t expect creative inspiration to be your guide because you’re going to be changing and correcting a lot of what you wrote the first time around.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17684">Writing the first-draft screenplay is done in three distinct stages: the first stage is writing the words-on-paper draft, which you’ve just finished; the second stage is writing what I call the “mechanical” draft, where you correct any changes made during the writing; and finally, the third stage, which I term the “polish” draft, where you’re polishing scenes and sequences until you’ve done the best job you can and the first draft is completed.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17685">When you finish the first words-on-paper draft, you’re ready to begin the process of rewriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17686">First, take a couple of days off to think about what you’ve done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17687">What parts do you think work the best? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17688">What doesn’t work? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17689">Are your characters fully fleshed out? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17690">Do you know already what changes you want to make? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17691">Just let these thoughts “cook” a little bit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17692">You don’t need to make any clear-cut or defined decisions at this point.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17693">The first thing in the rewriting process is to see what you’ve actually got. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17694">At this stage, you may not even know or remember what you did in Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17695">It’s easy to forget that when you’re in the paradigm, you can’t see the paradigm; you have no sense of overview, no objective perspective about what you’ve done or not done.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17696">You need some kind of an overview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17697">You’ll need to clarify your “take” on the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17698">You want to see what you’ve written with objective eyes and not be burdened with any subjective comments, likes or dislikes, judgments or evaluations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17699">You need to “unplug” from your subjective view to gain an “objective” overview.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17700">The way to do that is to read the entire first draft in one sitting from beginning to end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17701">Lock up all pens, pencils, notes, and papers, shut the computer down, and just jump in and start reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17702">Resist the temptation to write notes in the margins about the changes you want to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17703">This exercise is for you just to read what you’ve got. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17704">It’s the best way to gain objectivity.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17705">As you’re reading the screenplay you’ll notice you’re on a roller coaster of emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17706">You’ll read a scene and think to yourself how bad it really is, how could anybody write such drivel?; or, this is the worst thing I’ve ever read; or, the incidents and events of the story are so unbelievable and so predictable, nobody will believe it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17707">You’ll feel totally depressed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17708">Just keep reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17709">Then, you’ll read a scene you’ve written and think it’s not too bad, and then you’ll find another scene that works really well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17710">Certain scenes you’ll see are way too long and talky, but they can always be cut and trimmed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17711">You’ll be swinging on a pendulum of emotion, shifting between elation and despair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17712">Just ride the roller coaster and don’t get too plugged into your emotional response, whether it’s despair, depression, or suicide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17713">Just read the material.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17714">It’s easy to get distracted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17715">One my students, a well-known actress, had completed her first words-on-paper draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17716">Late one night she called after she had read her script through for the first time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17717">No sooner had I picked up the receiver than I heard her scream in my ear: “How could you let me write this…this piece of shit…it’s awful!” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17718">and she burst into tears and banged the phone down forcefully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17719">I looked at the phone, not sure how to react or what I should say or do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17720">So I did nothing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17721">Later, she told me that after she read what she had written, she threw the script down in total despair, called me, then crawled into bed, turned the electric blanket up as high as it would go, and assumed the prenatal position with thumb in mouth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17722">She stayed that way for two days.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17723">She overreacted, of course, and often, when you read something you’ve written, it can be a devastating experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17724">If this happens to you, just ride it out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17725">I waited about four days before I finally called her back because I knew she was going to have to deal with all those “unreal” expectations and emotions she had suffered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17726">We talked at length about it and she shared that she was numb, she didn’t feel anything at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17727">I suggested she wait a few days before she confronted her material again and “just do what you have to do to make it work.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17728">When she finally did sit down to rework the material, she told me she felt like a machine, with no emotion at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17729">When she was able to move from a subjective view into an objective overview, when she didn’t react to any of her judgments and expectations, and just concentrated on writing her story, it turned out very well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17730">It took her about two weeks to regain her confidence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17731">After all, she had taken her idea, formed it into a story line, then written and completed a first words-on-paper draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17732">That’s quite an accomplishment.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17733">So, when you finish this first reading, take some time to think about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17734">Contemplate your overall feelings about the story, the characters, and the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17735">As you begin to mentally “cruise” through the progression of the story line from beginning to end, you’ll move into an overview position to balance the characters and the relationships that exist between them.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17736">Is the story set up correctly? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17737">What about the relationships between the characters? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17738">Are they believable? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17739">Do they talk too much, or explain too much? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17740">Are the conflicts and obstacles your character confronts during Act II clearly defined? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17741">Do parts of the second act drag and sag? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17742">Does your ending work effectively?</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17856">As mentioned, this second draft is what I call the mechanical draft, meaning this particular stage of the rewrite is more about getting it down on paper than being clever and original. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17857">It’s “mechanical” because you just want to get the script in shape with a consistent narrative line, laying down scenes and dialogue which you know are not perfect but are used as a stepping-stone to the final, polish stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17858">This is where you are equalizing the story from what you started out to write and shaping it to fit what you did write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17859">Usually, I just throw the scenes down to get them on paper, and don’t worry about how good or bad they are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17860">I’m just smoothing things out, mechanically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17861">You’ll correct any changes you made during the first words-on-paper stage, bring the script to the proper length, tighten up the dramatic tension, and sharpen the focus of your main character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17862">Even though you’re going to possibly change a lot of things, perhaps rewriting 80 to 85 percent of Act I, maybe 50 to 60 percent of the First Half of Act II, 25 to 30 percent of the Second Half of Act II, and about 10 or 15 percent of Act III, don’t think of this as a “creative” draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17863">This draft should not take the same time or effort required as when you were confronting the blank sheet of paper in the first-words-on-paper draft.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17864">Concentrate on telling your story visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17865">You may find that you have the tendency to tell most of your story in dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17866">Maybe you’re “talking” your story, explaining the character’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17867">For example, your character may be driving a car, see a jewelry store and say “I need a jade ring,” and explain </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17868">why</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17869"> she needs the ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17870">Then you might show her walking into the store and looking at the rings while she tells the salesperson exactly what she’s looking for and why. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17871">She’ll purchase the ring and then you might cut into the next scene, where she is showing off her new jade ring at a party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17872">That’s basically a scene of explanation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17873">You don’t want too many of those.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17874">Instead, you can show the same thing visually: she sees the store, enters, and then cut into the next scene at the party where she is now showing off her new ring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17875">Woody Allen did something like this in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17876">Match Point</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17877">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17878">We’ve seen Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) caught in his emotional dilemma; he doesn’t know how or what to tell his wife, Chloe, (Emily Mortimer) about Nola (Scarlett Johansson) being pregnant with his child. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17879">Then, one night, he suddenly wakes up, eyes wide open as he realizes what he has to do to resolve the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17880">He doesn’t say anything and we don’t know at this point what his plan may be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17881">But at the moment he wakes up, he suddenly knows how he’s going to get out of his predicament. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17882">That silent, unspoken moment is the Plot Point at the end of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17883">And in Act III, we then see how Chris solves his particular “problem.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17884">Think visually, continually being aware of any cinematic transitions you might use as you move from one scene to the next and always looking for ways to enter and leave the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17885">Enter late and get out early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17886">Transitions are always a good way of cutting down the material, if that’s something you need to do.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17887">If you like, when you finish Act I of this mechanical draft, go back and clean it up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17888">Polish a scene or retype some pages, cut out a few lines of dialogue to make it clearer and tighter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17889">Don’t spend too much time on it; it’s important to move forward through the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17890">Always work from beginning to end, beginning to end.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17891">Move on to the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17892">Reread the material and make extensive notes in the margins on what you need to do to make it work, until you reach the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17893">You’ll find you might be changing about 60 percent of the First Half. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17894">Determine what changes you want to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17895">Then, if need be, lay out this section on 3 × 5 cards, just like you did with the Act I material.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17896">Always keep in mind your sub-dramatic context and strive for conflict, either internal conflict or external, or both, whatever works most effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17897">Make sure Pinch I is clean and tight and the Mid-Point clearly defined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17898">Sometimes, you may find that you have too many characters and need to condense two characters into one character; or use the first part of one scene on page 40 with the last part of the scene on page 55. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17899">Whatever you need to do to make your story work, do it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17900">Does your Mid-Point still work effectively? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17901">Is it too long or too short? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17902">Too wordy? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17903">Or does it need exposition, action, or visual clarification? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17904">Do you need to redefine it visually? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17905">Again, just write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17906">It doesn’t have to be perfect at this point.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17907">You’ll probably spend a week or two rewriting the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17908">After you’ve completed the Mid-Point, you can stop and move on to the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17909">Read it through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17910">Make notes on any changes you want to make. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17911">If need be, and if you feel comfortable doing it, you may want to restructure the Second Half on fourteen 3 × 5 cards just like Act I and the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17912">Sometimes you’ll feel like doing this and other times you won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17913">You be the judge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17914">You’re clarifying and redefining your story line so you want to make it as concise and visual as you can.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17915">Once you know what you need to do, execute it simply, keeping the dramatic context and time frame clearly in mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17916">You probably won’t have to change more than 25 to 30 percent of the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17917">Just keep your story on track as you follow your main character through the action, setting up Pinch II and then moving on to Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17918">This section may only take you about a week or so to complete, depending on how much time you can devote and what you need to do.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17919">When you finish Act II, don’t spend too much time polishing the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17920">You’re going to be doing this the next time around, in the third and final “polish” draft.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17921">When you reach Act III, you’ll really be home free. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17922">You know the resolution of your story, you’re in a good creative flow, and any changes you’ve made earlier in the material should have already been paid off in this unit of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17923">Rewriting this part of the screenplay is usually the easiest and takes the shortest amount of time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17924">You’ll feel like you’re almost done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17925">In Act III, you’ll be cleaning up and refocusing the resolution, and you’ll want to look for ways to add any new visual dynamics to make your ending stronger and more effective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17926">Here’s where you may have a better idea for your ending, and if that’s the case, change it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17927">Now’s the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17928">You may want to write a new dialogue scene or make it more visual, but first you’ll want to make sure you have resolved your story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17929">The actual writing process itself at this time is pretty clear-cut and manageable and you’ll probably know exactly what you need to do to finish this second draft of your screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17930">You should be able to complete this “mechanical” draft of your screenplay in about four to five weeks, and it should end up being anywhere from one hundred ten to one hundred twenty pages, no longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17931">Bringing it to the proper length should be one of your first priorities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17932">If you’re a first-time screenwriter, defined as someone who has never had a screenplay produced or purchased, they (whoever “they” are) are not going to accept a screenplay from you that is longer than one hundred twenty to one hundred twenty-five pages long.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17933">Sorry to be the one to tell you this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17934">Your story line needs to be clear, with all the necessary changes fused into an organic story line from beginning to end, within one hundred twenty pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17935">The average screenplay today is approximately one hundred twelve to one hundred twenty pages long.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17936">When you complete this mechanical draft, take a few days off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17937">Do what you want, but give yourself some time to digest the changes you’ve made. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17938">And then, you’ll be ready to move into the third stage, the “polish draft” of your screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17939">This is where you’ll really be writing the first draft screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17940">You’ll be polishing, accenting, and texturing each scene, changing a word here, a word there, a sentence here, a scene there, sometimes rewriting a scene up to ten or fifteen times to make it right.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17941">You’ll still be working in units of dramatic action, Act I, First Half and Second Half of Act II and Act III, but you’ll be approaching each scene with the lens of a microscope. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17942">You’ll go into each scene, analyze it, maybe cut this line, or move that line from the beginning of the scene to the end, lift one or two lines from the middle of the scene and tighten, condense, and polish the scene, word by word and line by line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17943">You may be removing or tweaking lines of description as well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17944">You want to make this “the best read” you can.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17945">One of the rules I created for myself when I was writing screenplays is that no descriptive paragraph should be more than four sentences long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17946">I know that’s an arbitrary statement, but I’ve read so many scripts that had “thick,” “dense,” “bulky” descriptive paragraphs of half or three-quarters of a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17947">You want lots of white space on the page because that’s what a professional screenplay looks like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17948">If you want to see what a professional screenplay looks like, get any screenplay, and read it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17949">Just Google </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17950">screenplays</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17951"> online and it will guide you to a number of sites where you can download scripts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17952">You’ll notice how the descriptive paragraphs are lean, tight, and visual without too much explanation.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17953">Sometimes, you’ll find you may want to remove an entire character and give his or her lines to another character, so you don’t have so many people on the page that the text becomes confusing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17954">Oliver Stone told me once that when he wrote the first draft of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17955">Platoon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17956">, he had twenty-six characters in the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17957">You can’t do that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17958">You want to keep the action and character lines flowing simply and smoothly.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17959">In this polish stage, after going over a scene five or ten times to make it right, you may find that it still doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17960">As you ponder this dilemma, you’ll realize that you might have to move three lines from a scene in Act I into another scene in the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17961">Or, you might bridge one scene with another scene, and drop a nice transition because it doesn’t really work that well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17962">You may telescope scenes, meaning you take one scene from the First Half of Act II, and combine it with another scene in the Second Half of Act II, thus establishing an entirely new scene that says the same thing in a shorter time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17963">Remember the purpose of the scene: either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17964">If your scenes do not satisfy at least one of these two requirements, then cut the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17965">You don’t need it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17966">You’ll be noticing certain rhythms of action, and possibly see places where a simple “pause,” or “beat,” before a character speaks will strengthen the dramatic tension of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17967">You’ll change: “he glances at the woman sitting across from him” to “he regards her questioningly.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17968">You’ll sharpen visual images by adding adjectives, tightening and condensing dialogue by cutting words from speeches, sometimes whole sentences, occasionally chunks of dialogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17969">Again, work in units of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17970">First, complete Act I, then the First Half of Act II, the Second Half of Act II, then Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17971">Working in units like this allows you to control your story and move forward, step-by-step, toward the resolution.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17972">Good structure, remember, is like the relationship between an ice cube and water, or fire and its heat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17973">As you’re polishing your screenplay, you’ll smooth the structural line until the incidents, episodes, or events that anchor the story line won’t even be noticeable.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17974">The key words are: tighten, trim, condense, polish, cut, cut, then cut some more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17975">Most new writers don’t like to cut words—or paragraphs—but you have to be ruthless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17976">If you’re wondering whether you should keep a scene, a specific line of dialogue, a descriptive paragraph, or a sequence, chances are that you’ll cut it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17977">There is only one purpose in this third, or polish draft, and that is to make what you’ve written into the best screenplay you can.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17978">How do you know when your rewrite’s done?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17979">It’s a difficult question, a hard call. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17980">You’ll never really know for sure, of course, but there are certain signs to look for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17981">First of all, understand that your script will never be perfect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17982">There will always be a few scenes that don’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17983">No matter how many times you write or rewrite a certain scene, it may never be the way you want it to be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17984">Sometimes, you’ll just have to let those scenes go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17985">No one will ever notice that they don’t work or measure up to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17986">your</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17987"> expectations.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17988">You might also find that you’re spending a lot of time on minor changes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17989">You may change “but there are signs,” to “and there are signs.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17990">That’s a sure sign that you’re ready to stop. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17991">That’s when you can lay down your pages and say, “It’s done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17992">I’ve completed the first draft of my screenplay.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17993">That’s when you can let it go. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17994">It will either stand or fall on its own.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17995">At this point, I might suggest that you give your first draft to one or two people </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17996">you trust</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17997">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17998">Personally, I would not suggest giving your script to your loved ones, or significant other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-17999">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18000">Because out of their love, kindness, and friendship for you, they’ll want to be as “honest” as they can; after all, you’re putting your trust in them to let them read and evaluate your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18001">So, out of their love for you, they’ll be ruthless; they’ll tell you that this character is dull, flat, or the premise doesn’t work and the dialogue is thin and weak. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18002">All your worst fears will be realized when you ask your loved ones to comment and critique your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18003">You’ve got to trust me on this one.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18004">For example, in one of my screenwriting classes, I had a woman who was blessed with a wonderful sense of humor and a naturally wacky and unique style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18005">She had never written a screenplay before but had an idea she wanted to write into a comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18006">So, she came to class and went through the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18007">She laid out her subject line, developed her characters, and then wrote the four-page treatment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18008">Then, feeling insecure about what she had written, she gave it to her husband to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18009">Now, her husband happened to be a very gifted film composer who had worked in Hollywood for years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18010">He read her treatment and out of the “goodness of his heart, out of love for his wife,” he wanted to be totally honest with her.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18011">And guess what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18012">In the name of love, he literally crucified her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18013">Your characters are weak, he told her; the plot is mundane; no one would ever believe the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18014">And you know, in his mind, he thought he was doing the right thing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18015">He really wanted to protect her from the harsh realities of Hollywood and didn’t want her to get hurt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18016">She listened politely to what he had to say, then took the treatment, put it in a drawer somewhere and never looked at it again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18017">To this day, she has never picked up that story line or sat down at the computer to make another attempt at writing the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18018">And, it was a good story that had a lot of potential.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18019">From that experience, I tell people not to give their material to a loved one, or spouse, or significant other for feedback; just know that out of their love and affection for you, they’ll confirm your worst fears. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18020">Or, they’ll tell you how much they like it and you don’t know whether it’s the truth or a lie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18021">We’re all so insecure anyway we never really, truly know whether what we wrote is working or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18022">And you don’t want anybody telling you what you already know.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18023">Especially in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18024">Most of the time nobody tells you the truth anyway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18025">They might say something like, “I like it but it’s not really something we want to do at the present time,” or, “we have something like this in development,” or “we’ve already done that movie.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18026">That’s not going to help you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18027">You want some feedback; you want someone to tell you what he or she really thinks about your script, in terms of what’s working or not, so choose the people you give this first draft to very carefully.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18028">After they’ve read it, listen to what they say. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18029">Don’t defend what you’ve written, don’t </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18030">pretend</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18031"> to listen to what they say and then leave feeling righteous, indignant, or hurt.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18032">See whether they’ve caught the “intention” of what you wanted to write about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18033">Listen to their observations from the point of view that they just </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18034">might be right</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18035">, not that they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18036">are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18037"> right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18038">They’ll have observations, criticisms, suggestions, opinions, and judgments. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18039">Are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18040"> they right? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18041">Question them; press them on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18042">Do their suggestions or ideas make sense? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18043">Do they add to your screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18044">Enhance it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18045">Or, didn’t they get it?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18046">Go over the story with them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18047">Find out what they like and dislike, what works for them and what doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18048">At this point, you still can’t see your screenplay objectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18049">If you want another opinion, “just in case,” be prepared to get confused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18050">If you give it to four people for example, they’ll all disagree. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18051">One person will like the relationship, another won’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18052">One person will say they like the robbery, but not the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18053">result</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18054"> of the holdup (they either get away or they don’t); and the other one wonders whether you couldn’t strengthen the relationship between the other characters.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18055">Having too many people read your material just doesn’t work—at least, not at this stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18056">You want initial feedback from two people you know you can trust, who will be totally honest with you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18057">When you’ve made all the changes you think will make the screenplay better, then you can send it out into the world through a literary agent, or producer, or production company, or attorney, or anyone you can get it to.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18058">It’s either going to stand or fall on its own. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18059">It’s not going to be “perfect.”</span></p>

				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18065">First, sit down and read the words-on-paper draft from beginning to end in one sitting; take no notes, just sit down and read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18066">You’ll be on a roller coaster of emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18067">Don’t fight it, don’t deny it, and don’t try to “reason” things out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18068">Just keep reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18069">You’ll be making changes in your head, and that’s okay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18070">You’ll swing between despair and elation, so enjoy the ride. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18071">When you’ve finished reading, take a day or two to digest your experience.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18072">Then, using free-association, write the three essays in a couple of pages each. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18073">The first essay you’re writing answers the question: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18074">What was it that originally attracted you to the idea?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18075"> Just throw down words, thoughts, and feelings as you recall your first spark of inspiration and why you wanted to write the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18076">Don’t judge or evaluate your answer; just throw it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18077">You want clarity and insight here, so you don’t have to worry about grammar, spelling, or the correct sentence structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18078">This is only an exercise for you, no one else.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18079">When you’ve completed this first essay, write the second essay: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18080">What kind of story did you end up writing?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18081"> You may have wanted to write an action-thriller but you ended up writing a romantic thriller. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18082">Define and articulate </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18083">what kind of a story you ended up writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18084">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18085">Do this in a couple of pages of free-association. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18086">Just throw down your thoughts, words and ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18087">Don’t limit or censor yourself.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18088">When you’ve completed the second essay, write the third essay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18089">Answer the third question in a couple of pages: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18090">What do I have to do to change what I did do, into what I originally wanted to do?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18091"> As mentioned, what you ended up doing may be a better script than what you originally wanted to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18092">So what do you have to do to change it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18093">You may need to set up the characters more forcefully, or strengthen the relationships, or open it up visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18094">This is an exercise that clarifies what you need to do make your script a good read.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18095">After you’ve answered the three questions you’re ready to move into the actual writing.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18096">Start with Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18097">Read it as a unit of dramatic action and take notes, either in the margin or on a separate piece of paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18098">Structure and correlate any new scenes with the old scenes written, and then, if need be, lay out your new Act I structure on fourteen 3 × 5 cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18099">Go over the cards until the flow of action feels comfortable to you, then begin writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18100">Your first few pages may be stilted and awkward; it’s okay, don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18101">This is only the “mechanical draft.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18102">You may be changing anywhere from 80 to 85 percent of your material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18103">Don’t worry about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18104">Just do it.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18105">Work in units of action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18106">The whole process of rewriting this first act could take a week or two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18107">Don’t worry if your work feels stilted, or episodic; just lay out your story line focusing on the threads of your story.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18108">Then move into the First Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18109">Read this unit of dramatic action, make notes in the margins, and, if need be, restructure it on 3 × 5 cards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18110">Then, start rewriting, one scene at a time, one page at a time, through Pinch I to the Mid-Point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18111">You may be changing 50 to 60 percent of the material in this unit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18112">Be clear on your sub-dramatic context, and what you need to do to smooth out the story line.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18113">As you write the Mid-Point, be sure the focus of your story is clear and defined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18114">Then move into the Second Half of Act II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18115">Use the same process; read the material, take notes, structure it on 3 × 5 cards if needed, then start writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18116">In this unit of action, you’ll only need to change about 40 to 50 percent of the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18117">Just change what you need to change; don’t worry about rhythm, tension, or transitions in this “mechanical” stage.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18118">Move into Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18119">Bring it to length, and make all the changes needed for a consistent story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18120">Check your ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18121">Does it work as effectively as you want it to? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18122">Or, do you need to modify it somewhat, perhaps even change it radically? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18123">What’s important is that it works; do what you need to do to make it the best ending you can.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18124">When you’ve completed this “mechanical” stage of the screenplay, move into the “polish” stage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18125">Again, work in thirty-page units of dramatic action; polish, hone, clean, tighten, accent, cut, and shade your material.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18126">Your name is on the title page, so do the best job you can.</span></p>
				<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18127">Remember, a screenplay is a reading experience before it becomes a film experience.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18162">What attracts me immediately is the way the words are put down on paper: crisp, sparse, and visual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18163">I can tell whether the story is set up in the first few paragraphs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18164">Does it open with a dynamic inciting incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18165">Does it grab my attention? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18166">Are the characters appealing, well-rounded, and three-dimensional? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18167">Is the premise and situation set up with insight and clarity in the first ten pages? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18168">Is there enough information presented to captivate me so I want to continue reading? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18169">Or is the story cluttered with too many characters, dense plots, and subplots?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18170">When I find a “good read,” I know it; there’s a certain excitement and energy that grabs me immediately, from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18171">What I’m looking for is a writing style that moves the action across the page like lightning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18172">Where I can’t help but keep turning pages, which, of course, is the screenwriter’s function—to keep the reader turning pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18173">And this, believe it or not, is the contradiction: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18174">nobody likes to read in Hollywood, yet everybody loves to read a good screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18175">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18178">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18179">Because there are so many poorly written screenplays; perhaps one out of a thousand is worthy of moving up to the next level of the executive chain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18180">And when you find a “good read” everyone wants to read it, so it is faxed and emailed to development executives all over Hollywood.</span></p>

The reader reads the script, then he or she writes up a short, detailed synopsis and offers his or her personal opinion of the material in a couple of pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18188">This is referred to as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18189">coverage</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18190">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18191">Coverage is a tool for the film executive who doesn’t read the material but has to respond to the person who submitted it, either agents or producers or directors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18192">Coverage includes the name of the writer, the particular genre, a logline (a brief, one-sentence description of the story), and various checkpoints on a chart which indicate the reader’s judgment regarding the quality of material in terms of structure, character, story, dialogue, and overall writing ability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18193">It is broken down in terms of: excellent, good, fair, and poor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18194">I’ve taken the liberty of summarizing a reader’s evaluation from a major film company and it’s a pretty good reflection of what the reader looks for when assessing the material.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18275">Today, more people are writing screenplays than ever before and the popularity of screenwriting and filmmaking has become an integral part of our society and culture. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18276">Last year some seventy-five thousand screenplays and teleplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18277">Out of all these, some four hundred and fifty films were produced, either in Hollywood as major studio productions, or by various independent film companies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18278">You do the math.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18279">Within the next few years, the number of people writing for the visual media will probably double and triple in size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18280">And it’s only going to expand exponentially as the evolution/revolution of technology impacts the world and the way we see things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18281">It seems this is the only time in human history where we have created a technology which our children are teaching </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18282">us</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18283"> how to use.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18294">The marketplace for the screenwriter is changing drastically and the need for new directions in terms of visual storytelling is in its infancy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18295">Right now, television programming is being made and distributed specifically for our cell phones and iPods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18296">Already, companies are looking to produce specialized material for the vast number of markets that will be available.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18453">When I first started thinking about writing this book, I wanted to find some kind of tool that the screenwriter could use in order to recognize and define various problems of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18454">But as I began writing, I became aware that I was really writing about the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18455">solutions</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18456"> to various problems, and not really identifying them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18457">It just didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18458">So I began to rethink my approach. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18459">To solve any kind of a problem means you have to be able to recognize it, identify it, and then define it; only in that way can any problem really be solved.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18460">The more I began thinking about the “problem,” the more it became clear that most screenwriters don’t know exactly what the problem really is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18461">There’s a vague and somewhat tenuous feeling somewhere that something is not working; either the plot is too thin or too thick; or the character is too strong or too weak; or there’s not enough action, or the character disappears off the page, or the story is told all in dialogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18462">So I began analyzing the Problem-Solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18463">The only way I could make this book work, I realized, was to recognize and define the various </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18464">symptoms</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18465"> of the problem, very much the way a medical doctor isolates the various symptoms of his patients before he can treat the disease.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18466">When I approached the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18467">Problem-Solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18468"> process from this point of view (and it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18469">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18470"> a process), I began to see that there’s usually not just </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18471">one</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18472"> symptom, but </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18473">many</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18474"> symptoms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18475">It soon became clear that many of the problems in screenwriting share the same symptoms, but the problems themselves are different in kind; only when you analyze the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18476">context of the problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18477"> can a distinction be made, and it is those distinctions that lead us on the path of recognizing, defining, and solving. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18478">For the truth is that you can’t solve a problem until you know what it is.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18479">With that in mind I began to understand that there are only three distinct categories of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18480">The Problem;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18481"> when you’re writing a screenplay, all problems spring either from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18482">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18483">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18484">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18485">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18486">The art of Problem Solving is really the art of recognition</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18487">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18488">You can look at any problem in two ways: the first is to accept the fact that a problem is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18489">something that doesn’t work</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18490">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18491">If that’s the case, you can avoid it, deny it, and pretend it doesn’t exist. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18492">That’s the easy way.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18493">But there’s another way of approaching the problem, and that’s to look at any creative problem as a challenge, an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18494">opportunity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18495"> for you to expand your screenwriting skills.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18496">They are really both sides of the same coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18497">How you look at it is up to you.</span></p>

			<h1 class="chap_title3"><b class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18500">The Art of Problem Solving</span></b></h1>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18501">A few weeks ago, during one of my screenwriting workshops, a student turned in some pages from her screenplay with a somewhat worried and concerned expression on her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18502">I didn’t say anything, I simply took the pages and read them.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18503">The scene she had written took place at the beginning of the Second Act, as the main character, a lawyer, is investigating the mysterious and unexpected death of her mother, who had died while recovering from a simple surgical procedure in the hospital.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18504">Stunned and grieving, she is trying to find out why her mother had suddenly died, but no one has any answers, and no one is talking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18505">The doctors placate her, the nurses know nothing, and the hospital administrator is concerned and suggests she join a grieving group. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18506">Her grief turns to anger, and she’s determined to find out what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18507">Pursuing lead after lead, she manages to locate one of the nurses who had taken care of her mother right before she died. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18508">The nurse had mysteriously quit the hospital a few days after the mother’s death, had changed her address and literally disappeared. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18509">But through her own persistence, and some lawyer friends, she manages to track the nurse down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18510">And now, she’s going to talk to her.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18511">This was the scene my student had just written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18512">As I read her pages, I began to get some insight into why she appeared to be concerned about it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18513">She had written the scene like an interrogation; the main character questions the nurse, who is reluctant to say anything about her mother’s death.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18514">This was an important scene, and it had to be handled in such a way that it both moved the story forward and revealed information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18515">She’s tough, feisty, and smart, and she’s not just going to accept what happened, but she’s determined to find out why it happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18516">And this scene is the first real clue the main character has which confirms her suspicion that some kind of cover-up is going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18517">Somebody made a mistake here, and because of it, her mother is dead.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18518">I waited until the people in the class had finished reading the pages, then I turned to the young woman who had written the scene, and asked, “What do you think?”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18519">She was very quick to answer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18520">“I think something’s wrong,” she said, “it just doesn’t feel right.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18521">She was right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18522">She had a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18523">problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18524">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18525">Problems are common in screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18526">The old expression “Writing is rewriting” is very true. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18527">But in my experience there are two ways you can look at a problem:</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18528">The first is to say that a problem is something that doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18529">Very simple.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18530">The second way is to say that a problem is an opportunity, a challenge that will allow you to ultimately improve your craft of screenwriting.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18531">Two different points of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18532">But any way you look at it is the same: a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18533">problem becomes the fuel of creativity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18534">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18535">You either view it as an obstacle or an opportunity; either a problem is something that doesn’t work, or an opportunity for you to move up to another level.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18536">It’s up to you.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18621">The first step in Problem Solving means to rethink the needs of a scene; you must take it apart in order to isolate and define the emotional forces working on, and within, the dynamic of the scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18622">The scene is the living cell, the hub of dramatic action, and serves two basic functions in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18623">One, the scene moves the story forward; or, two, reveals information about the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18624">These two elements of story and character must be served in each and every scene, visually, if possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18625">Look at any scene in any screenplay, study any movie, and see whether this is true or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18626">It’s very common to read the pages of a screenplay and find pages and pages of extraneous scenes devoted to incidents or encounters that have absolutely nothing to do with the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18627">By definition, a screenplay is a story told in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18628">pictures</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18629">, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18630">This is something I never get tired of repeating, because for some reason we always seem to forget it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18631">Each scene always has to move the narrative line forward, from beginning to end, beginning to end, even though it’s not necessarily in that order, as illustrated by </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18632">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18633"> (Quentin Tarantino), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18634">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18635"> (Patrick Shane Duncan), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18636">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18637"> (Anthony Minghella, beautifully adapted from the book by Michael Ondaatje).</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18638">The scene my student wrote, which she could only describe as being “soft and fuzzy,” is really a key scene that moves the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18639">But the way she wrote it was not sharp enough; the dialogue was too nice, too direct; there was no tension, no subtext working, and it washed out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18640">There was not enough definition or dimension in it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18641">So I had her redefine the character’s dramatic need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18642">In this particular scene the character’s dramatic need is to find out any information she can about her mother’s sudden and mysterious death. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18643">Was there any wrongdoing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18644">A mistake of some kind? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18645">Why did the nurse suddenly quit and leave the hospital? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18646">Is there a cover-up going on? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18647">What’s happening here?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18648">These are all important questions within the context of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18649">And context, remember, is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18650">space that holds something in place</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18651">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18652">It is the space inside the glass that holds the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18653">content</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18654">—water, coffee, tea, milk, beer, soft drink, grapes, nuts or raisins, whatever—in place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18655">The space inside the glass does not change: it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18656">holds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18657"> the content together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18658">It is the gravity of the scene; it is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18659">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18660">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18661">I knew my student had to make the scene sharper, more defined, with more tension, and the only way to do that was by generating more conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18662">So I made some suggestions: maybe the nurse is not at home when the main character arrives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18663">Maybe the first thing she has to do is wait. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18664">Maybe in her car. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18665">Maybe a couple of hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18666">This provides a back story to the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18667">It lets the character enter the scene with some built-in tension.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18668">So let’s add some more conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18669">The main character has had to wait a couple of hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18670">So what else can we do to create conflict in the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18671">What if the nurse has a boyfriend, and maybe the guy’s not too bright and he lets the main character, the lawyer, into the apartment before the nurse arrives home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18672">He assumes they’re friends. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18673">So she could already be in the house when the nurse arrives home.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18674">These elements would add a great deal of conflict to the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18675">The nurse arrives home, she’s pissed at her boyfriend for letting a stranger, the lawyer, in, and we can see by her defiance and attitude that she’s frightened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18676">For sure this woman knows what happened to the character’s mother and does not want to say anything about it, for whatever reason. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18677">Maybe she’s even preparing to leave town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18678">But she’s tough and doesn’t want to give anything away.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18679">What does that do to the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18680">Obviously, it sharpens the dramatic forces within it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18681">What had been soft now shows more potential for tension and conflict; there’s an edge to it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18682">And there’s a way to get even more out of the scene; throughout this book I’m going to be referring to the value of writing short essays about your story and characters, defining and expanding events and relationships. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18683">Even though the nurse is a minor character, she is important to the story, and therefore becomes an important scene in the story development and cannot be “fuzzy” in its execution.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18684">I suggested that she sketch in the nurse’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18685">What exactly did she see in the hospital? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18686">How much does she know? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18687">What actually happened? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18688">I told her to create a step-by-step series of events from the nurse’s point of view that led up to the death of the lawyer’s mother.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18689">Once that was done, I had her define the relationship between the nurse and her “boyfriend.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18690">There might be more subtext that could be mined for maximum dramatic value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18691">So I had my student write a short </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18692">free-association essay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18693"> about their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18694">Simply to sharpen the elements of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18695">Where did the nurse meet him, how long have they been together, is it a serious relationship? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18696">Or maybe it’s over; maybe they’re getting ready to separate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18697">The answers to these questions allow you to expand the dynamic forces working from within and without the scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18698">These are steps that need to be taken so the dramatic elements that are necessary to drive the story forward can be heightened and defined.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18699">She went back to the “drawing board,” did the exercises I suggested, and began to see things from a different perspective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18700">She created more possibilities for her screenplay by simply listening to her feelings of discomfort about what was wrong with these pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18701">Throughout the cycles of history and literature, there have always been attempts to define the art and craft of writing, about what it is and how it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18702">To me, writing is all about asking questions and then waiting for the answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18703">The answers will always be there and in most cases will reveal themselves in a totally unexpected way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18704">That’s part of the wonder of the writing process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18705">Aided by these written exercises, my student was able to go deeper into the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18706">She began to see it differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18707">She </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18708">saw</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18709">, for example, that when she first wrote the scene the interaction of her characters was vague and hazy, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18710">soft</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18711">, and clarified that by redefining the dramatic need of the main character.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18715">So let’s take this to another level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18716">We all know that drama is conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18717">Without conflict you have no action; without action you have no character; without character you have no story; and without story you have no screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18718">You only have a succession of incidents and events that flows to its conclusion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18719">It looks like a story, it acts like a story, but there’s really nothing there but a bunch of hooks, gimmicks, or special effects.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18835">Problem Solving is part of the creative process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18836">So what’s the problem? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18837">Read over the pages you think are not working and see if you can isolate or define the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18838">Maybe your story doesn’t follow one line of action, but goes off in several different directions at once. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18839">Or maybe too many things are happening to your main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18840">For example, your main character may be a cop, but you think you should show more about his partner, so you write some scenes about his partner, and pretty soon you’ll find you’ve created an entire subplot that gets in the way of the story; or maybe you want to show the bad guy being “badder,” so you keep adding scenes showing just how bad he is; that happened in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18841">Die Hard With a Vengeance</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18842">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18843">It’s an easy way to “fill” the story but only succeeds in getting in the way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18844">By spending so much time with other characters, you’ll ultimately end up losing your main character and your story will probably end up going all over the place, in several directions simultaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18845">The real problem is losing the focus on the main character, and that’s who your story is really about.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18846">Sometimes, when screenwriters don’t know what to do next, or what happens next, they’ll simply add a new character to the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18847">Rather than working to develop the dramatic context of the scene, story, or character, or expanding the action, all they do is add a new character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18848">But that won’t work because it’s really a problem of developing </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18849">story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18850">, not character, although one always reflects and incorporates the other.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18851">Or maybe you read your pages and decide that you have too many characters in the story, or that your main character is too passive, too reactive, and seems to disappear into the background while a minor character pops up and takes over the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18852">What is your story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18853">And who is your story about?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18854"> That’s what always has to be kept in mind.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18855">So, do this little exercise where you free-associate about what the problem is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18856">It’s important to remember that when you do it, you’re rereading pages with the awareness that you’re looking for something that’s not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18857">Just throw down any thoughts, words, or ideas in free association; you don’t have to worry about grammar or spelling (nobody’s going to see this but you), so just throw it down without regard to how good or how bad it is, or whether it’s right or wrong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18858">Don’t make any judgments about your writing or what comes up; your judgments tend to censor and smother your creativity if you listen too closely.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18882">That’s the starting point in defining any problem areas in a screenplay—or all writing, for that matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18883">What is it that’s not working? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18884">If a scene is not working, is it because of a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18885">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18886">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18887">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18888">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18889">Is the material boring? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18890">Too talky? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18891">Does the scene, or action, move the story forward, or does it reveal information about the character?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18892">If the line of action wanders too far from the story, a solution might be to add elements that keep the story anchored and moving forward; so that’s an element of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18893">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18894">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18895">But in altering the plot you’ll also find yourself forced to restructure the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18896">Changes to the plot and structure will affect your character’s actions and reactions, requiring more adjustment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18897">And that’s how you’ll fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18898">All three areas will always be related to one another; only the approach differs.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18899">When you can isolate and define what’s not working in the screenplay, you’ll see that any problem will have some kind of relationship to these three areas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18900">And that shouldn’t be so surprising. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18901">In life everything is related to everything else; nothing exists by itself alone, but only in its relationship to something else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18902">So any problem in the screenplay will always exist in some relationship to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18903">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18904">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18905">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-18906">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19014">When you’re developing a screenplay, and building and putting it together into a series of related incidents, episodes, or events, it should be leading you to the dramatic resolution, the solution of your story.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19259">To unplug from the material and put you into an overview mode, I tell my students, whatever country they’re in, to write three short essays, in free association, or automatic writing, not more than a page or page and a half, to see the material as a whole.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19260">But before you do these essays, you need to read the screenplay through from beginning to end first, in one sitting, with no interruptions or phone calls or sudden desires to wash the kitchen floor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19261">You want no distractions at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19262">Most importantly, lock up all your pens and papers in the drawer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19263">This is an exercise.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19264">As you’re reading the screenplay, you’ll notice some emotional shifts; you’ll read a scene and wonder how could anybody write this drivel; or you’ll think it the worst thing you’ve ever read, or see the incidents and events of the story as so outlandish that nobody would believe them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19265">You’ll feel totally depressed; just keep on reading. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19266">Then you’ll read a scene you’ve written and think it’s really not too bad, and then there’s a scene that really works well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19267">Certain scenes you’ll suddenly be aware of are way too long and talky, but you know they can be cut and trimmed, and you’ll swing on the pendulum of emotion between elation and despair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19268">You’ll simply experience a roller coaster of emotion as you read through the material.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19269">When you finish your reading, take some time to think about the screenplay; contemplate your overall feelings about the story, the characters, and the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19270">As you begin to “cruise” through the progression of your story from beginning to end, you’ll balance yourself out and start to move into an overview position to see the relationships between the parts and the whole, the relationships that exist between Act I, Act II, and Act III.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19400">As will be stressed throughout this book, everything is related to everything else in a screenplay; if you have to open up and redefine or restructure the story line and premise in these first ten pages, then you have to know that whatever changes you make, like sharpening and tightening the action or dialogue, will affect and change something else in another part of the script.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19402">Whether your story is about a person caught in a web of extraordinary circumstances, or whether you’re dramatizing an interior struggle, your character will be engaged in an emotional journey culminating in some kind of change in his or her thinking or behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19403">You may feel your character needs to be better illuminated, so then you may find it essential to go back into your character biographies to define and redefine his/her relationships.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19404">You must take the time to set up the foundations of your story line through the action and the characters in this unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19405">If you feel the material in Act I is too slow, or not visual enough, check your physical location. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19406">Is there a strong visual arena? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19407">Are your characters talking, or explaining, more than necessary? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19408">Too much dialogue always slows the action down except when the story and situation play against each other, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19409">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19410">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19411">Samuel L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19412">Jackson is always spouting from the Bible in a way that is somewhat humorous, but then we learn he’s a professional killer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19413">And he can quote from the Bible and pull the trigger in the same breath. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19414">And it’s this contradiction of character that makes the screenplay so effective and why Tarantino is such a gifted filmmaker.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19415">If your problem is in the second ten pages, and you are following focus on the main character, do these pages show his or her relationships in a way that moves the story toward Plot Point I?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19416">If you feel that the relationships are thin, or you introduce another character or characters, you may have to redefine those relationships by writing a one- or two-page essay on each character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19417">This exercise allows you to bring a greater depth of character to the screenplay and establish stronger relationships between characters, because you now know these characters with a new and deeper understanding, “see” them in a new light.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19418">Maybe you want to create two lines of visual action by intercutting a new character with the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19419">When you have two lines of dramatic action operating simultaneously, this could possibly weaken the thrust of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19420">Just follow the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19421">If that’s the case, and the action is too weak for this opening unit of dramatic action, then you may have to cut out the other character and focus the action on the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19422">Your story is always moving toward Plot Point I, so anything that does not further the action either has to be cut or rewritten. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19423">When you’re writing a screenplay, you have to be ruthless, especially when you’re in the process of solving a problem, even though you may feel you’re cutting the best things you’ve written.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19424">Just serve the material.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19425">Have you set up the Plot Point at the end of Act I? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19426">Have you executed the Plot Point as effectively as you can? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19427">Does it do the job? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19428">Are you clear about what it is? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19429">If not, you have to define it to yourself clearly, so you can set it up and render it dramatically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19430">Whether it’s an action sequence, or a character decision, or even a change in locale, the Plot Point I is the true beginning of your story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19431">That’s why you have to take so much time and be so careful in writing Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19432">You have to be totally clear on who these characters are and the story line and execute it properly, so you can move into the First Half of Act II riding the crest of the story wave you have been setting up from the very first scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19433">In most rewrites in the Problem-Solving process it is not surprising to rewrite about eighty to eighty-five percent of Act I, either by sharpening or tightening the dialogue, or writing new scenes that bring the action into sharper focus, and being able to keep only a few scenes from the original pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19434">What’s most important in Act I is making sure enough visual and emotional information is given. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19435">If you need to do a major rewrite to solve a particular problem in Act I, then rethink this unit of dramatic action completely; take some three-by-five cards and restructure the story line on fourteen cards, writing one scene per card—though that is a contradiction when you are writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19436">If you feel you have a problem in Act II, you have to go through the same process; first you have to identify the problem, then locate it in the proper structural framework of the story line before you can actually move into the Problem-Solving process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19437">First, where is the problem as you see it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19438">In the First Half of Act II, or the Second Half of Act II? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19439">If the problem is in the First Half, where is it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19440">Between Plot Point I and Pinch I, or Pinch I and the Mid-Point? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19441">If it’s in the Second Half of Act II, does it fall between the Mid-Point and Pinch II, or between Pinch II and Plot Point II?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19442">When you’ve isolated and defined the problem you need to be very specific, narrowing your perception so you can design a solution to the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19443">It’s very important to find out exactly where the problem occurs because then you approach it from a structural overview and thus uncover and refocus the dramatic elements that lead up to the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19444">When you take the problem apart like this you begin to see very clearly what you need to do to fix it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19445">Remember, Act II is approximately a sixty-page unit of dramatic action that goes from Plot Point I to the end of Plot Point II and is held together with the context of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19446">Confrontation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19447">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19448">The Mid-Point breaks Act II into two basic parts, the First Half of Act II and the Second Half of Act II.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19469">If your problem is with the main character, he might be talking too much and slowing down the action, or the overall focus of the character may be too narrow or tight (for example, are you going from INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19470">to INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19471">to INT. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19472">in your scene construction?)—so you may need to open up the action visually, using different locations.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19532">Recently I conducted a screenwriting workshop in Rio de Janeiro. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19533">Screenwriters from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Chile had been chosen by their respective ministries of culture to participate, and they had all come to Rio to attend the three-week workshop.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19534">It was intense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19535">We met four hours a day, six days a week. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19536">The first week we spent preparing the material, and the second and third weeks we were writing up to ten pages a day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19537">Sometimes more.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19538">It was difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19539">The one thing they needed, I told them, was something they didn’t have—time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19540">They didn’t have time to contemplate their stories, and nurture all those nuances of character; the only thing they could do was write, to throw down all those thoughts, words, and ideas that came to mind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19541">That way they could push aside the mind’s resistance and limitations and allow the creative Self to emerge and guide them along the path of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19542">Though Portuguese, Spanish, and English were all spoken, the language barrier proved to be no barrier at all; each writer wrote in his or her native language, the pages were then translated into English, and everybody read the pages in their native language.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19543">My experience with the Latin American writers only reinforced what I’ve discovered in my travels and workshops; that no matter where you are in the world, no matter what language is spoken or what culture you’re in, the language and grammar of screenwriting are the same, whether in Paris or Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Tokyo, or Hollywood; writing is writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19544">The way the screenwriters approach their material may be different, as it is in Europe and America. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19545">But some of the problems are the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19546">The European and Latin American screenwriters basically approach their screenplays in the same way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19547">The Europeans come from a historical, intellectual tradition, and they base their material on the strength of the original concept or idea; this tradition has been laid down and followed since the fifteenth century in all the great universities.</span></p> <p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19548">This approach is still prevalent today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19549">The European screenwriters (and Latin American writers) approach the screenplay from the idea of the story; it is this idea that pushes the story forward, dramatizes it, becomes its visual metaphor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19550">The filmmaker will take the idea and dramatize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19551">Just look at the trilogy </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19552">Red,</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19553">White,</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19554"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19555">Blue,</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19556"> from the great filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19557">Each story embodies a certain idea, like justice, and this theme is seen visually throughout the film, in the characters’ emotions, as well as in the colors of the costumes and locations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19558">The colors reflect the idea, the theme, and become an integral part of each story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19559">Recently I had the opportunity of seeing Michelangelo Antonioni’s latest film, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19560">Beyond the Clouds</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19561">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19562">The opening image is of John Malkovich in an airplane high above the clouds, telling us he is a director, an observer of life; we then follow him through the four different episodes of the film and listen to his comments while observing the behavior of the characters.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19563">The idea behind the film is the “search for love,” and following this theme, we observe four different relationships. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19564">In the first segment, the girl is looking for a relationship through “words.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19565">It is the words of love that are important to her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19566">In the second episode the director becomes involved with an exotic woman who searches for the “passion of love.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19567">In the third a marriage of many years is threatened by the husband’s attraction to a beautiful woman, and finally the wife leaves him to search for the love he cannot give her anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19568">And in the last episode a young man pursues a young woman on her way to church, and waits for her during Mass, only to learn that she is “afraid of life,” and will enter a convent the next day.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19569">Everyone is searching for love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19570">It is this idea that drives the film forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19571">Dramatizing the idea creates the structure.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19572">In a film like Wim Wenders’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19573">Wings of Desire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19574">, for example, the screenwriter begins with the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19575">intellectual idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19576">, and then clothes it in a dramatic way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19577">The story is about an angel (Peter Handke) who longs to know what it’s like to be human. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19578">So Wenders shows us what it is to walk the path of a true human being. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19579">In the opening shots we </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19580">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19581"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19582">hear</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19583"> the stream of consciousness of humanity as a parade of people passes in front of our eyes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19584">Young and old, we witness their thoughts, their hopes and fears, their worries, their dreams. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19585">It’s a wonderful opening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19586">Finally, the angel descends and becomes a human being, and we follow his journey through life and love, through the joys and sorrow of walking the path of life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19587">But in the United States we approach the screenplay differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19588">Here, the screenwriter begins with an idea, then takes that idea and shapes it into a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19589">story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19590">, fashions it into a dramatic story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19591">What’s the difference?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19592">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19593">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19594">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19595">It is a story about the fragile nature of relationships, the fear of commitment, the patterns of mother and daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19596">During the story we learn about the lives of the women who make up the quilting bee. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19597">But the story focuses on the relationship between Finn (Winona Ryder) and her fiancé, Sam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19598">We witness her doubts and feelings, and through her we see the stories of the other women, woven together just like the “quilt of love” they are making for Finn’s wedding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19599">It is a story, with beginning, middle, and end, and in the end her relationship is resolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19600">She follows the crow, who, just like the story in the quilt, leads her to Sam, and the last image we have is the two of them bedding down for the night in his VW bus. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19601">Set-Up, Confrontation, Resolution;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19602"> beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19603">It is the story that drives this film, not the idea of commitment in relationships.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19604">A few years ago I saw a short film by a French filmmaker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19605">It was about a man who walks into a McDonald’s restaurant on the Champs-Elysées and buys a huge order of french fries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19606">He finds a strategic spot in the restaurant and suddenly begins throwing french fries all over; at the people, against the walls, on the floors, on the ceiling, everywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19607">The people are furious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19608">(It’s a serious comedy.) Many of the patrons challenge him but the man pays no attention and continues throwing the fries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19609">The police arrive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19610">They warn the man.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19611">But as soon as they leave, the man goes right back to throwing french fries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19612">Soon, the entire restaurant is in an uproar. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19613">At the peak of their frenzy the man whips out a camera and starts taking pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19614">Photograph after photograph is taken, and then in a blazing cut we see these same people as the subject of huge photographs now on display in a prestigious art gallery in Paris. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19615">It is only then that we understand that this man is a renowned artist, and the same people who were cursing him at McDonald’s are now spending huge bucks to buy these so-called works of art.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19616">Art is freedom of expression</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19617">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19618">That’s the idea behind the film; the idea is dramatized.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19619">The European screenwriter takes an idea and dramatizes it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19620">The American screenwriter takes an idea and builds it into a story to dramatize it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19621">If we took the idea that art is the freedom of expression, we would create a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19622">So we would search for a visual metaphor, a visual arena, to show our character, the artist, struggling for some kind of new art form, a new expression.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19623">Who is this artist? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19624">What is his life like? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19625">What are the relationships in his life? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19626">Where is he in his career? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19627">What is his relationship to art? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19628">What about his friends, his family? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19629">Is he successful or not?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19630">These questions all have to be answered to create a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19631">We take this information, the answers to these questions </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19632">(writing is really the ability to ask the right questions)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19633"> so we can structure this idea into a story line; we set up the artist’s life in Act I, show who he is and what he does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19634">The Plot Point at the end of Act I will be the particular incident or event which finally shows him that, in order to survive, he must change his artistic expression and seek out a new form, maybe even a new medium. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19635">We set up a crisis period in his life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19636">Act II would focus on his struggle to create a new form, and all the conflicts and hardships he has to endure in his professional, personal, and private lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19637">Gradually, we see him forging his first new form of expression, and then, at Plot Point II, he finds out what he has to do to generate a fusion of environmental and performance art.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19638">Act III would show him executing his new “art form” in the McDonald’s restaurant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19639">Which is the entire French film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19640">Art is the freedom of expression—as seen from the European point of view and an American perspective.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19641">The point to be made is that whether it’s a European or Latin American or American film, the problems of screenwriting are the same; it doesn’t matter in what language or culture the script is being written.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19642">A screenplay is a story told in pictures, and there will always be some kind of problem when you tell </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19643">the story through words</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19644">, and not pictures.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19645">It seems obvious, but I have had this experience over and over again: some of the writers I’ve worked with forget that a screenplay is a story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19646">They feel that if the characters can explain their particular thoughts, feelings, or emotions, the story line will somehow move forward through the characters’ dialogue, not the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19647">Through words, not pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19648">They think because the character talks a lot there will be insight and dimension; but the truth is that we must see the character in a situation that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19649">reveals</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19650"> his/her personality, no matter what the conflict or obstacle, whether it is an internal, emotional one, or an external, physical one.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19651">Why is this significant?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19652">Because at this period in our history, we are in a major communications revolution, and the screenplay is a form that is constantly evolving, for film is a combination of both art and science. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19653">It is a craft that drifts upon the growth of scientific technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19654">There are times when the screenwriter writes something and science has to create a technology to make it happen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19655">Like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19656">Terminator 2: Judgment Day;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19657"> the special effects had not been created when the script was completed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19658">They </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19659">hoped</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19660"> the special effects would work, and they did, and because of the science, film took a giant leap forward to making the art of film “more real.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19661">Without the computer graphics created for </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19662">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19663">, we would not have been so affected by the dinosaurs in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19664">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19665"> (David Koepp) or the oddity of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19666">Forrest Gump</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19667"> (Eric Roth). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19668">Or all those morphing commercials that are flooding the television screens.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19669">The computer technology of the nineties has literally exploded, creating a global revolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19670">The Internet, Web sites, all the on-line systems, connect the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19671">As of this writing over 50 million people in North America were on-line in 1997. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19672">The Wall Street Journal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19673"> says that the number of people using the Internet is going to double and quadruple within a very short period of time.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19674">That’s only the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19675">Around the world people are using the Internet as part of their daily news-gathering ritual, and it is changing the ways we communicate with each other on a global scale. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19676">And this revolution is literally </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19677">changing the way we see things</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19678">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19679">At this point in time we have become a visual society, and are no longer a literate one; the last fifty years have changed all that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19680">No longer do we get our news and opinions from the written word. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19681">We get it from CNN, or the local news, and the Internet; we hear and see our music on CDs and video; and the latest study declares that the average person watches television on the average of three hours a day, more on the weekend; our children are computer literate by the age of six, and most of the time they are the ones who are teaching us to use the computer.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19682">This evolution of science and art is creating a new language of film, a more visual way of telling stories for the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19683">The language of film is becoming more visual; scripts filled with pages and pages of great dialogue are now considered “too talky.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19684">Two people talking in an office or restaurant, explaining things to each other, rarely works anymore.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19685">This seems to be one of the most common problems in screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19686">Over and over again, in country after country, most of the stories unfold through dialogue, not action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19687">The characters talk and talk, and this only leads to a story that is dull and boring, developing through events that need to be explained.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19688">Talking heads.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19689">That’s not screenwriting, that’s stage writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19690">An essential part of all screenwriting is finding places where silence works better than words, finding the right visual arena, or image, to tell the story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19691">Today’s films are much more visual, the character’s emotional arc expressed through the character’s actions and reactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19692">“What is character but the determination of incident?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19693">says Henry James. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19694">“And what is incident but the illumination of character?”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19695">How people react to the incidents and situations of the story tells us something about who they are: in other words, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19696">what they do is who they are</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19697">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19698">When I first saw </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19699">Forrest Gump</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19700">, I thought it was a very, very talky film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19701">Most of the story is told through dialogue along with the voice-over narration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19702">Act I reveals who Forrest is, and his voice-over tells us things we need to know, but the dialogue and images don’t contradict each other, they </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19703">complement</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19704"> each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19705">Forrest tells us he has to wear leg braces because he has “a curved spine,” and wearing them will make him “straight as an arrow.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19706">At first glance Forrest is dumb, maybe even stupid, as his IQ test states, but “stupid is as stupid does,” he says, quoting his mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19707">And on the surface most people think he’s some kind of retard, a “cripple,” on the ocean of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19708">So we see by his braces that he’s a “cripple,” physically challenged, and this image is shattered when he is chased by the bullies and forced to run for his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19709">Voice-over and dialogue complement each other, and this technique keeps the story from becoming talky, or dull and sentimental. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19710">Forrest is a man who follows his dreams, then makes them come true.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19711">Later, his behavior shows us something else: Forrest Gump is anything </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19712">but</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19713"> a cripple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19714">Though the words, pictures, and actions are different, they complement each other and move the story forward.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19715">The same with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19716">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19717"> (Jane Anderson). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19718">Before the story can truly begin, we need to know who this character is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19719">So Finn’s narration opens the film when she’s a little girl, and tells us about the relationship with her mother, grandmother, and quilting friends, and then, in a beautiful cut to present time, visually tells us what her problem is: her relationship to Sam and how anxious she is about getting married. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19720">She tells us that she has trouble completing things; she’s working on her third master’s thesis because every time she’s getting ready to complete it, she moves on to another subject and starts all over again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19721">That, of course, is what her mother did with the men in her life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19722">For Finn it is this fear of commitment that drives the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19723">In the end, however, she learns to follow her heart as the crow leads her to her understanding and final acceptance that Sam is truly her soul mate.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19724">Both these screenplays are studies in character, but in order to reveal who the characters are, and what the obstacles are that confront them, we must see who they are, through their actions </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19725">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19726"> their words.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19727">Not through talking heads.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19728">So if you have a problem in that you think your story is being told in words, look for places to illustrate your character’s behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19729">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19730">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19731"> (Callie Khouri) the title characters are packing for a two-day holiday to the mountains. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19732">Here’s the way Thelma packs: She grabs everything in sight, then throws and stuffs it into the suitcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19733">She pulls open her cosmetics drawer and empties the contents into the suitcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19734">Pulls open another drawer of clothes, dumps it into the already bulging suitcase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19735">And that, we see, is the way she lives.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19736">Contrast this visually to the way Louise packs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19737">They’re going away for two days, so she takes two pairs of pants, two blouses, two bras, one bathrobe, two sweaters, two pairs of socks, throws in another pair just for good measure, closes her suitcase, wipes clean the single glass in her spotless kitchen sink, and leaves.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19738">The difference between Thelma and Louise is the difference between night and day, an apple and an orange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19739">Just from that simple action of packing a suitcase we learn a wealth of information about these two characters: one is messy, the other is neat, and it certainly reflects who they are in terms of their relationship with the men in their lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19740">Thelma married Darryl when she was seventeen, and the thought of growing old with him is not very appealing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19741">“You get what you settle for,” Louise comments.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19742">Louise is not going to settle for the kind of relationship that Thelma settled for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19743">As a matter of fact, this emotional decision of Louise’s is what kicks the whole story of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19744">Thelma &amp;</span></i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19745">Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19746"> into motion; in the back story Louise’s boyfriend, Jimmy, a musician, has been on the road for three weeks and has not called her once. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19747">And she’s pissed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19748">So, “to get even,” she decides she’s not going to be home when he comes back in town. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19749">She’s not going to let him treat her that way, and this decision sets up the whole story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19750">By making the arrangement to be with Thelma out of town when Jimmy arrives home, Louise barrels down the road of fate that leads to her killing Thelma’s rapist at Plot Point I.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19751">Within the context of this story and these characters, the simple illustration of packing a suitcase reveals more information than dialogue ever could.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19752">Instead of having your characters talk about their situation, let their behavior make the story line unfold in a more visual manner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19753">Action is character; what a person does is who he is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19754">Film is behavior.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19755">Now, it may be that your characterization requires your characters to talk a lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19756">That’s okay; just take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19757">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19758">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19759">The whole story is basically dialogue, and one long scene of dialogue leads to the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19760">The difference is in the quality of dialogue; Tarantino is a master at capturing the little quirks of character and behavior, like the discussion Jules and Vinnie have about McDonald’s.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19817">After all, some parts of the story are more difficult than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19818">And some scenes need more work than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19819">But after a few days struggling with these particular pages, struggling with some of these thoughts and feelings, you may notice some doubts about your abilities as a writer begin to surface. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19820">You may find yourself thinking too much, asking yourself questions like: What am I going to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19821">How am I going to get back on track? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19822">I wonder if I’m in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19823">Writer’s Block</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19824">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19825">You’ll question yourself, your talent, your ability to get the job done.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19829">It’s one of those common problems that strike fear in the hearts of screenwriters everywhere.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19830">In one of my recent screenwriting workshops, a student came into class one night with a strained and somewhat tortured look on her face. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19831">When I asked her what was wrong, her eyes welled up with tears and she became very serious, and said, “I don’t know where I’m going. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19832">I’m totally lost, I’m confused, and my pages are pure shit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19833">All that’s happening is talk, talk, talk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19834">I keep going around in circles and I don’t know what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19835">I’m so upset, I could cry.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19836">It’s a universal problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19837">How you get out of it varies from person to person, script to script, but the first thing to do is to admit </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19838">you have a problem</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19839"> and it’s not going to go away until you deal with it, and confront it head-on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19840">That’s just one of the truths of life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19841">In my student’s case she was so close to the material, she couldn’t see it anymore, so the first thing I wanted her to do was just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19842">When you reach this kind of crisis point, you’re so overwhelmed and frustrated that you have to regroup. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19843">Just stop writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19844">Put down your computer, pen, and paper, typewriter, tape recorder, however you’re working, and spend some time contemplating your story: What is your story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19845">What is the dramatic need of your main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19846">How are you going to resolve the story line? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19847">The answers to these questions are the key to getting back on track.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19848">My student’s story was about the reunion of four sisters after the death of their grandfather. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19849">In his will he had left them the house on the lake where they had all grown up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19850">The main character had left this small southern town many years before to seek a professional career in New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19851">She had a lot of success in the city, but at the time the story begins, the company she has been working for all these years has just been purchased by a larger corporation and she’s been informed that a major restructuring of her department is planned, and could possibly affect her position. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19852">That’s the back story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19853">When the story begins she is uncertain about the future, about her plans, about herself.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19854">When she arrives, it is time for an emotional self-inventory, a time to clean up her life and renew her relationships with her three sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19855">She’s thrown into the cauldron of past and present, and must find her own way out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19856">It is a dramatic and emotional situation loaded with dramatic possibilities.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19857">So I started asking some questions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19858">The writer explained she was in the middle of the Second Act, so the first thing I asked her was if she was clear on her structural story points. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19859">She wasn’t, she confessed; she was unsure about the Mid-Point, and felt so confused, she wasn’t sure about Plot Point II either. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19860">She didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19861">So we went through the Problem-Solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19862">Step by step. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19863">The first thing I had her to do was redefine the dramatic structure; so she went back to the story line and structured it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19864">Paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19865">, identifying Plot Point I, Pinch I, the Mid-Point, Pinch II, and Plot Point II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19866">She was still somewhat unsure about her ending, about whether the main character should stay and pick up the pieces of her life, or leave to go back to city and confront the uncertainty of change with a newfound awareness.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19867">Then I wanted to know if she felt this was a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19868">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19869">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19870">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19871">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19872">“Character,” she replied, without hesitation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19873">I didn’t necessarily agree with that; I thought it might be a problem of both </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19874">Plot and Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19875">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19876">Look at it from both sides. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19877">From the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19878">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19879"> side, the screenwriter had to deal with and know the inside, or emotional subtext, of the story; she had to trace the emotional arc that revolves around the relationships of the four sisters and whether they settle their differences or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19880">From the point of view of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19881">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19882">, she had to be clear about the forces affecting the character from the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19883">outside:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19884"> what happens to the house; if it’s sold what are they going to do, and if they keep it what are they going to do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19885">Questions, questions, questions.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19886">We started from the character’s emotional state at the time the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19887">What is she feeling when she leaves her home in the city to return for her grandfather’s funeral? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19888">What’s going on in her life? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19889">In her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19890">professional</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19891"> life with her career, and in her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19892">personal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19893"> life, with her relationships, and then in her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19894">private</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19895"> life—what she does for herself, and how she feels about herself.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19896">So we explored this a little. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19897">In the back story her company has just been taken over by a conglomerate, so how does she feel about it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19898">How old is she when the story begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19899">Is there some kind of biological clock ticking, or already ringing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19900">Is her grandfather’s funeral going to get in the way of an important business decision? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19901">I wanted the writer to define the forces working on the character from the very beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19902">What’s going on with her relationships? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19903">Is she in a relationship? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19904">Is it a good relationship, is it beginning to unravel, or is she alone? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19905">Define it, from the beginning, when they first met. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19906">What would she do if she left her position and looked for another job?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19907">These emotional questions needed to be answered and clearly defined before my student could go back into the story and confidently dig more deeply into the character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19908">Then I had her define her relationship with her sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19909">I asked if she had gone back into the character’s childhood and examined their feelings for one another, suggesting that she could even create some new incidents or events that might have happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19910">When she finished with that, I had her do an exercise in which she created a key experience in the life of the main character (her name was Abby), which might have happened between the ages of ten and sixteen, something that can reflect and become an emotional undercurrent of the story in present time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19911">It may have been something that happened between her and her grandfather, or a traumatic incident with one of her sisters, something Abby still remembers and thinks about.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19912">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19913">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19914"> it’s the fact that Louise refuses to take one step in the state of Texas, even though it’s going to cost her life; later we learn she was raped when she was a young girl living there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19915">That’s why she shoots Harlan in the parking lot when he’s attempting to rape Thelma.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19927">I told the writer that she had to dive back into her characters’ lives and redefine Abby’s feelings when she returns and deals with the death of her grandfather, whom she had loved dearly; and how does she feel now that she is returning home? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19928">My student had not even considered these questions, or the emotional forces working on her characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19929">If you’re writing this story, I told her, you have to know your characters’ thoughts, feelings, and emotions; especially during the early years growing up at the lake, as young adults, and, most important, how they feel about each other now, in present time.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19930">Another issue the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19931">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19932"> exercise created was the influence of what the house means to each of the sisters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19933">In terms of memories, cash value, and sentimental attachment, whatever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19934">That house means something to each of the sisters; what is it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19935">If you don’t know, just read or reread Chekhov’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19936">The Three Sisters</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19937">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19958">“I knew I should have stayed away from this subject,” you might think to yourself; or “I can’t write worth shit.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19959">Soon you’ll begin to expand and enlarge upon your own insecurities, thinking, “I don’t know whether I should be writing this script,” or “maybe I just don’t have the talent to do this.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19960">or, “maybe I should just find a partner and write it with someone else.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19961">It goes on and on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19962">But underneath all these thoughts, comments, or judgments you’re making is the common thread that somehow this is all “your fault.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19963">If you could do it, you would, and if you can’t, it’s because you don’t have the talent or ability to do it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-19964">In short, we turn it inside and blame ourselves.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20084">It’s not an uncommon feeling, and while it may be true some of the time, it’s not true all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20085">When you take a look at what you’ve written, and make the judgment that it’s dull and boring, what can you do to fix it?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20086">In other words, what is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20087">nature of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20088">?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20089">To really understand it, we have to explore the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20090">symptoms of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20091">—those traits in your writing style that may lead to writing dull and boring pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20092">And since this is a book about recognizing and identifying the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20093">symptoms</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20094"> of various screenwriting problems, we’re going to take a look at what makes up the essence of dull writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20095">That means examining the relationship between bad writing and good writing, since you can’t define anything until you measure and compare it to something else; nothing exists in relationship to itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20096">And since </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20097">relationship</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20098"> means a connection between two or more things, it means we can’t define dull and boring writing until we know what makes up good writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20099">When you read a well-written screenplay, “a good read,” the words literally leap off the page at you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20100">Part of it is style, yes, part of it is structure, yes, but the real dynamic of good screenwriting is creating strong and active characters, combined with a unique, stylized visual narrative that constantly moves the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20101">Many films reflect this very well: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20102">The Shawshank Redemption, How to Make an American Quilt, Sense and Sensibility</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20103"> (Emma Thompson), blend story with character, and a situation many people can relate to. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20104">Twelve Monkeys</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20105"> (David and Janet Peoples) blends a strong visual style with an interesting dramatic premise, but it’s a “one-line” script (it lacks depth and dimension) that moves the story forward to its contrived and somewhat predictable ending. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20106">Blade Runner</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20107"> (Hampton Fancher and David Peoples) treats this same kind of theme more imaginatively, as does </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20108">The Fugitive</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20109"> (Andrew Davis).</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20110">Strong action and strong characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20111">That’s what makes good screenwriting.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20112">One of the interesting things about a dull or boring screenplay is that nobody will tell you that it’s dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20113">People will say they didn’t like it, or it didn’t work for them, or they didn’t like the characters or the premise, or maybe it’s too serious, or too funny. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20114">But no one, not even wife, husband, lover, or best friend, will tell you that what you’ve written is a dull and boring screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20115">Go through your own experience and check it out.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20116">In the long run, whether you’ve fallen into the pit of “dull and boring” is something you’re going to have to determine for yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20117">You might have to admit the possibility that you’ve written something that needs to be more active, more dynamic, something that will keep the reader turning pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20118">Because that’s what good writing is all about—keeping the reader turning pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20119">So, what are some of those qualities that make up good screenwriting?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20120">Several things: perhaps the most important is to understand that the foundation of all good dramatic writing is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20121">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20122">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20123">All drama is conflict; without conflict you have no character; without character you have no action; without action you have no story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20124">And without story you have no screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20125">Dramatic conflict can either be </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20126">internal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20127"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20128">external;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20129"> an emotional story like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20130">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20131">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20132">Sense and Sensibility</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20133"> has internal (and external) conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20134">External conflict is a story where the conflict is outside the character, and the characters face physical (and of course, emotional) obstacles, such as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20135">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20136"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20137">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20138"> (Michael Crichton and David Koepp). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20139">Creating conflict within the story, through the characters and events, is one of those simple, basic “truths” of all writing, whether it be novel, play, or screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20140">In my seminars and workshops, no matter what the language or culture, I find that many screenwriters do not understand the importance of conflict in their stories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20141">And their screenplays reflect that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20142">So many times the characters seem listless, the scenes slow, taking too much time to develop; there is little or no direction, and it boils down to a screenplay that is dull and boring to read.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20143">So what is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20144">conflict</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20145">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20146">If you look at the word it means to be “in opposition”; and the hub of any dramatic scene is having the character or characters be in opposition to some</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20147">one</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20148">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20149">something</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20150">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20151">Conflict can be anything, a struggle or a quarrel, a battle or a chase scene, internal or external, any kind of confrontation or obstacle, and it really doesn’t matter whether it’s emotional, physical, or mental.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20152">Conflict must be at the very hub of your story, because it is the core of strong action and strong character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20153">If you do not have this conflict, this foundation to your writing, you’ll find yourself more often than not caught in the quagmire of dull writing.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20284">Think about creating an incident that works upon your character in such a way that his or her reaction reveals a more forceful and illuminating dimension of character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20285">This creation of incident will be reflected in the scenes you choose to write, for the screenplay is revealed through the scene; it is the cell of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20286">A scene is composed of shots, what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20287">camera sees</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20288">, and it can either be a single shot, or a series of shots, held together by a specific </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20289">location;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20290"> where the scene takes place, and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20291">time</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20292"> when it takes place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20293">If you change either place or time, then you have to change the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20294">Moving from the kitchen to the living room to the garage means three different scenes, because there are three separate locations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20295">If you had a scene in the kitchen in the morning, then have one in the afternoon, it’s two different scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20296">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20297">Because you have to change the light; morning light is totally different from afternoon light, so if you change the time, that means making a lighting change and you must therefore write a new scene.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20313">The obvious way to do that scene would be to have the warden tell Tommy that he’s never going to get a chance to testify, that he knows he’s lying, and nothing Tommy would say or do could convince the warden to open up Andy’s case for a retrial. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20314">Normally, we’d expect the warden would help Andy reclaim his innocence, and count on Tommy to help him do it.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20356">One of the things I’ve discovered about the nature of dull is that while scenes may be structured well, with the dialogue clean and sharp, there is no payoff to the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20357">We don’t see the natural conclusion of the scene because the screenwriter cuts away before the purpose of the scene is fulfilled. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20358">I’ve read so many screenplays where the writer seems to forget why the scene is in there in the first place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20359">Each scene is related to every other, and you’ve only got 120 pages to tell your story, so you can’t waste time writing scenes that are not paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20360">Characters, incidents, events, decisions, all need to be set up at some point in the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20361">It doesn’t have to be in the scene before, or in the same scene, or in the scene after, it can be anywhere, because all aspects of a story line are related to one another and therefore information can be planted anywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20362">It can be set up in the first ten pages, then paid off in Act II or III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20363">What really matters is when you set something up in the screenplay, you have to pay it off, either visually or verbally; either through pictures or dialogue.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20368">Why four? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20369">There are many reasons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20370">First, when you’re writing a screenplay there has to be a lot of white space on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20371">Long, bulky, single-spaced paragraphs that take up a half page or more are just too difficult to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20372">I tell my students that I don’t care what the particular action is, they just can’t put it all into one descriptive paragraph. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20373">Break the paragraph up into four or five sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20374">A reader reads the screenplay as if he or she is seeing the movie on the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20375">So pages have to be lean, clean, and tight, and not bogged down with a lot of descriptive comments that will never make their way to the screen.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20376">The quickest way to make a reader put down a screenplay is to stop him with a lot of thick and bulky paragraphs that fill up the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20377">It turns the reader off, and becomes another symptom in the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20378">nature of dull</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20379">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20446">What happens when you read a screenplay and you have the impression that something’s wrong with it, but you don’t really know what it is? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20447">If you think about it, you might be able to trace your awareness, or discomfort, from the very beginning of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20448">And if you examine that feeling a little further, then go back and take another look at the material, you’ll probably see that the problem has been present right from the beginning.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20449">As a general rule, if you want to find the origin of any problem you have to start looking for it at the very start—from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20450">If you do that and analyze the material, you may begin to notice some things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20451">For example, there may be too many characters, or you don’t really know who the main character is, who the story is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20452">Or maybe it just feels like the script is too talky and the action progresses more through dialogue and exposition than the visual image. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20453">Or so much seems to be happening that the focus of the story, what it’s really about, seems choppy, sloppy, and disjointed.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20454">Look at the material again, and you will probably realize that there is so much information being given and the story moves so fast, you might not really know what’s going on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20455">All these elements are symptoms of too much information being given too early in the story; too much is happening too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20456">The result: not enough depth or insight into the characters and not enough conflict or drama in the narrative line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20457">And it’s definitely a problem.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20458">If you want to look for the cause or the source of this particular problem, it will almost always be found in Act I and, more specifically, in the first ten pages of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20459">A good screenplay is set up from page one, word one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20460">Act I is a unit of dramatic action that begins with the opening scene and continues until the Plot Point at the end of the act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20461">It is held together with the dramatic context known as the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20462">Set-Up;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20463"> because all the elements of the story, the characters, the dramatic premise and situation, the relationships between them, must be established within this particular unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20464">Act I is a unit of action in which all the elements of the story must be carefully integrated and set up; all the incidents and events in this unit of action must lead directly to the Plot Point at the end of Act I, the true beginning of your story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20465">If the script is not set up correctly, then there is a certain tendency to keep adding characters and events to the story line to make it move faster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20466">The story seems to skate on the surface of the action without penetrating its layers of texture and depth, creating the feeling that the story is trite, contrived, and predictable.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20467">Why does this happen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20468">It seems like many writers approach their screenplays without enough preparation; they’re so anxious to begin writing the script that they don’t take the time to explore and develop the relationships between the action and characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20469">So they begin from the smallest kernel of information and then feel their way through the First Act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20470">Most of their time is spent trying to figure out what the story is about and what happens next, so they throw down as many story points as they can in the First Act, hoping the story will manifest itself.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20471">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20472">Seeds are planted, but not cultivated, watered, or nourished. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20473">The writer tells his or her story in the first ten pages, then is lost and doesn’t know what to do next.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20474">Preparation and research are essential to the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20475">It is the responsibility of the screenwriter to know and clearly define who the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20476">main character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20477"> is, what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20478">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20479"> is—what the story is about—and what the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20480">dramatic situation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20481"> is—the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20482">If you don’t know the story well enough, if you haven’t spent enough time doing the required research, then you run the risk of inserting more incidents and events into the story line just to try to make it work, and then the narrative thread of the story usually goes awry; the stuff just isn’t working.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20483">Sometimes the problem exists because the story line is too thin, and more “plot” has to be found, but the solution is not creating more interesting incidents or characters to put into the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20484">Creating more “things” to happen, more obstacles to confront, doesn’t do anything except expand the problem.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20485">The trouble is often traceable to a writer’s impulse to get the script off to a fast and provocative start. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20486">If you’ve only got ten pages to grab the attention of the reader or audience, then the tendency is to make sure the story captures the reader’s interest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20487">And often that means dumping the characters, their obstacles, and their relationship with the other characters into this ten-page unit of dramatic action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20488">It’s too much, too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20489">More is not necessarily better. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20490">If you take great screenplays like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20491">Shawshank Redemption, Thelma &amp; Louise, The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20492">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20493">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20494">, all the major ingredients of the story line are either there in place, or referred to, within the first ten-page unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20495">That’s why the context of Act I is the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20496">Set-Up</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20497">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20563">That’s why each element of the story line must be carefully laid out before you even begin writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20564">Believe it or not, most problems in screenwriting are there because not enough research was done; the story, the characters, and all the dramatic forces working on the story have not been thought out enough.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20565">The inclination to put too much, too soon, into your story line is, I find, usually the result of a number of different things, but the primary cause is that most writers don’t spend enough time doing character research. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20566">A biography of the main character may not have been written, or maybe not enough was written, with the result that the character seems thin or unsympathetic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20567">The result: a weak character so busy reacting to all the incidents and events of the plot that he or she becomes passive and seemingly disappears off the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20568">The main character will have no point of view, and some of the lesser, or minor, characters take over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20569">The main character becomes lost in the background.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20580">This particular problem of too much, too soon, is defined as a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20581">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20582">, but the symptoms we’ve been analyzing stem from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20583">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20584">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20585">Why is that?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20586">Because to fix this kind of problem you’ve got to open up, develop, and enlarge the incidents of the story line, adding new </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20587">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20588"> elements even though the problem evolves from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20589">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20590">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20591">For example, a woman was writing a story that takes place in the sixteenth century about a band of traveling musicians. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20592">The main character is a young woman, deeply in love and recently married, whose husband, when the story opens, is accidentally killed in a river accident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20593">Right after the funeral, her father is determined to marry her to an old man, a very rich and respected merchant, but she refuses and will not obey his commands or honor his wishes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20594">She doesn’t know what to do, but when she’s invited to a lord’s estate to cure his young son (she’s set up to be a natural healer), she allows herself to be seduced by him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20595">Her action permits her to get out of the unbearable situation with her father, but sets her apart from the others in the band. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20596">She is filled with pride and independence and no one is going to tell her what to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20597">Especially when it concerns her feelings.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20598">The nobleman is enchanted with her, but when he learns she has used him (he was only a solution to a problem, after all) he vows that if he can’t have her, no one else will either. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20599">So he sets into motion a plan that will keep her as a prisoner in his castle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20600">And we know that if she ever goes to prison, this free spirit will literally wither and die.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20601">That’s basically the story, and it works well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20602">When my student began writing the screenplay, she began hurrying the action, putting in too much information because she thought she had to explain how the musicians lived, what their society was like, and their interrelationships within this musical clan. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20603">She structured Act I this way, opening with the group crossing a raging river, when suddenly the husband falls into a swirling eddy and can’t swim against the mighty current and drowns. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20604">The young wife rushes to him, but it’s too late. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20605">The funeral follows, and immediately following the ceremony her father tells her that he has sold her to the old man, the merchant, and she must marry him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20606">She can’t deal with it and flees, but after a few weeks the young widow is summoned to the nobleman’s estate to cure his son. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20607">The son recovers, the nobleman becomes infatuated with her, and she determines that he is the answer to her prayers and lets herself be seduced.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20608">Being seduced by the nobleman is the Plot Point at the end of Act I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20609">It gives us enough time to set up the death, the relationships within the band, and establish the dramatic premise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20610">The dramatic and visual possibilities are strong, the emotional opportunities rich. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20611">The narrative flow of events gives us a good insight into the arena of life of the traveling musicians.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20612">But the woman was still insecure about the story and wrote everything that should happen in Act I into the first ten pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20613">She literally shoved everything together so the main character meets the nobleman by page 10. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20614">As a result, everything happens so fast that nothing is really developed; all the insights that could give us a full and rich portrait of the characters were omitted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20615">In terms of story, there was too much information being given too soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20616">Everything was mashed together and the events simply rode on the surface of the story like a leaf floating on the water.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20617">When I explained that she had too much information in these first pages, she did not really know how to fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20618">I told her she had to go back into her characters in order to get more material, so as to develop Act I more completely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20619">So I gave her an exercise: I had her write a free-association essay about the main character’s emotional state; what her feelings were for her husband/lover during their courtship and marriage.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20620">Then I had her develop an emotional back story to her character; what happened between wife and husband immediately before the story begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20621">Maybe they had an argument the morning before crossing the river; maybe they had just finished making love and vowed their love for each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20622">I had her describe the character’s feelings of grief and loss, her anger at being left behind without him, and her fury and frustration at being bound by the constraints of this unwritten law.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20623">The exercise helped the woman approach some of those emotional bridges that have to be crossed in order to develop character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20624">When she became more familiar with her character’s emotional life, I had her take each one of the events she had written in those first ten pages, and separate them into individual sequences with a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20625">I had her write them all out, in a page-or-two essay; when she finished, she could add and create new material that would allowed her to open up the fertile landscape of her story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20626">A </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20627">sequence, remember, is a series of scenes connected by one single idea with a definite beginning, middle, and end</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20628">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20629">A funeral, a wedding (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20630">Four Weddings and a Funeral</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20631"> is really five sequences strung together), a chase, a shootout, and so on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20632">Here’s how we broke it down for Act I: The band moving toward the river then crossing the river is one sequence; being swept away and the chase leading to the young husband’s death, another; her reaction to the loss, her mourning, the funeral, another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20633">All these sequences are complete within themselves and can be structured individually into beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20634">Because the new material has to be expanded, structured, and woven into the story line, it brings more depth and dimension to the emotional needs of the character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20635">That’s why it’s a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20636">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20637">, though it encompasses elements of both </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20638">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20639"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20640">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20641">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20642">The solution to this particular problem is more easily approached from the perspective of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20643">Plot;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20644"> that is, we add events to the story line in order to develop the dramatic action more fully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20645">I’m sure it would be easier if we could clearly and conveniently separate each problem into its own little category complete unto itself, but that’s not the way it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20646">In life, as in screenwriting, everything is related to everything else.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20647">Because </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20648">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20649">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20650">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20651"> are the foundations of screenwriting, they will always be interrelated, though certain problems can be approached more easily via one category than another.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20652">You could also solve this kind of problem by approaching it from the category of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20653">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20654"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20655">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20656">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20657">It really doesn’t matter how you approach the problem as long as you identify and define it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20658">What’s most important is to find the right way to set up your story; find the picture, or the scene, that best illustrates the story </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20659">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20660"> the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20661">As mentioned, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20662">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20663">, the script opens with Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) and other astronauts at a party, watching Neil Armstrong’s landing on the moon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20664">The picture on TV and the simple comments by the characters let us know immediately that these people are involved in the space mission to the moon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20665">Within the first ten pages we know that Jim Lovell’s dream, his dramatic premise, is to return to the moon.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20666">All this information has been set up simply and economically by the screenwriter’s knowledge of who these characters are, what their dramatic need is, what the story is about, and the circumstances surrounding the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20667">What’s set up in Jim Lovell’s case is that he knows he may never fly to the moon again because of the accident in the Apollo spacecraft.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20668">This is just good screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20669">Everything we need to know, we know within this first ten-page unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20670">It sets up the story so that Plot Point I, the true beginning of the story, is the blastoff into space for the Apollo 13 mission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20671">And thus the temptation to set up the story through dialogue has been avoided.</span></p>

			<h1 class="chap_title3"><b class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20722">The Need to Explain</span></b></h1>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20723">Recently, I read a screenplay about a boat builder on the coast of the Yucatán who is forced out of business by an unscrupulous politician demanding bribes and he reacts by floundering in a lifestyle of drunkenness and bankruptcy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20724">He becomes his own victim. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20725">Since the story is about his redemption, we see him go through his transformation by joining a rebel action to help bring about the fall of a Central American dictator.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20726">It is a good action piece, has great visual locations, and has the potential to be a good vehicle for the character’s growth, change, and development. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20727">But the screenplay didn’t read that way and the story’s potential was never realized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20728">And here’s why.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20729">The writer opens the screenplay with a scene where the main character delivers a boat, which he has been commissioned to build for the politician. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20730">Everything seems fine; there are nice visuals but no real conflict as the scene is meant to reveal the extraordinary design abilities of the main character, the builder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20731">The boat he has built is literally a piece of art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20732">And, the way the scene is written, both characters seem satisfied with the transaction.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20733">Cut to five years later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20734">The main character is now struggling for work, has the reputation of being unreliable, an alcoholic, and we see him lose several jobs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20735">And his design abilities are never again mentioned or play any significant part in the rest of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20736">At Plot Point I, needing money, he accepts a job as a crew member on a large fishing boat, and during a severe storm the boat is shipwrecked farther up the coast. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20737">Forced to remain in this thinly populated area while they repair the boat, they discover a band of guerrillas who enlist them in their cause to overthrow the local political dictator, a man groomed and supported by the same unscrupulous politician that ran the main character out of business. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20738">He joins them and takes the first steps along his journey of repentance that leads to recognizing his own self-worth and regaining his dignity as a person.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20739">That’s the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20740">During the first part of my read things seemed okay, but around page 30 I began to notice that my attention was wandering, and the more I read the more aware I became of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20741">So I knew something was wrong; something was not working as well as it should. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20742">I started looking for the source of the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20743">What I began to see was that the main character was constantly reacting to the situation, and somehow he seemed to be lost on the page in relationship to the other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20744">He was involved in every scene, yes, but he seemed bland and uninteresting, and just seemed to disappear off the page.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20745">The first symptom.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20746">I went back to the very beginning of the screenplay, and started looking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20747">When I examined the opening scene between the builder and the politician, I saw there was no conflict at all between the two men, either internal or external. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20748">And in the next scene, when the writer cuts into the story five years later, we see the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20749">reaction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20750"> to the man’s plight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20751">What I saw immediately is the main character was always explaining his actions, his situation, his life, to the other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20752">That stopped the forward flow of the story as the character has to justify why he is here, what he is feeling, what his dramatic need is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20753">Because the reader isn’t shown the character falling into the pit of hard times during those five years, he or she has to be informed what happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20754">If you don’t show it, you have to say it; you have to explain it for the story to move forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20755">And when that happens your character is lost on the page, caught in the web of talking heads.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20756">We don’t have to explain everything in a screenplay; we just have to know what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20757">It’s not a question of not explaining anything, it’s a question of how the explanation is written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20758">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20759">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20760"> the very first shot under the credits is the actual newsreel footage of the first Apollo astronauts caught in the fire in the space capsule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20761">Three lives were lost, and if we didn’t see this, we would have to explain it, because it is the spark that ignites the whole story, moving Jim Lovell’s crew up to the Apollo 13 slot in the NASA schedule.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20762">Many times during the screenplay the screenwriter will have the urge, or the need, to explain things—things about the character, things about the situation, things about the story—because if something is not clear, it has to be explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20763">It is one of the most common problems screenwriters encounter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20764">The process of screenwriting always remains the same, but the creative problems are always different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20765">If there is an action scene, and we don’t know what’s happening, it has to be explained at some point in order to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20766">That’s the only way to hold the reader or audience’s interest.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20767">Exposition is a key element in the craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20768">The word itself is defined as the “information necessary to move the story forward.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20769">There are two ways to write exposition; set it up through dialogue, or dramatize it through pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20770">Exposition is the easiest, yet the hardest, dialogue to write. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20771">It states the obvious, which makes it easy, because the screenwriter simply puts down what needs to be said in order to move the story forward; hard, because the dialogue is usually so obvious, it’s embarrassing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20772">How do you solve this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20773">By finding ways to dramatize the exposition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20774">By finding the right visual image, or metaphor, to serve the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20775">Broken Arrow</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20776"> opens with a fight scene in which Deke (John Travolta) is boxing with his air force copilot, Hale (Christian Slater). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20777">Who these characters are, and the forces working upon them, are revealed by their actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20778">Deke doesn’t hesitate to use any maneuver he can to defeat Hale. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20779">Hale believes in the rules, fighting hard to win, but never sacrificing his humanity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20780">There is a dialogue between the two men within the riveting action of this scene, and it reveals everything we need to know about their characters throughout the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20781">And, in the end, the motivation, or purpose, behind Deke’s plan to steal two nuclear weapons only needs to be explained in a few lines of dialogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20782">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20783">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20784"> we create the explanation of the story, the premise, in the little interactive presentation that the Sir Richard Attenborough character puts on for his visitors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20785">In his demonstration that is part animation and interactive live action, he explains that mosquitoes in the Jurassic Park era would feed off the dinosaur’s blood, then get trapped in tree sap, which would fossilize to amber. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20786">Now, millions of years later, the amber is pierced and the mosquito fossil’s blood siphoned off, and through the advancement of genetic technology we have been able to create dinosaur clones.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20787">That’s the entire premise of the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20788">If we don’t believe that, then “there is no willing suspension of disbelief” and the story becomes a joke.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20789">So, how do they set this up? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20790">They explain it, sure, with both pictures and images. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20791">But first you have to grab the reader or the audience’s attention, so the script opens with an action sequence that reeks of mystery and suspense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20792">That’s Spielberg’s great gift as a filmmaker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20793">We don’t yet know what’s going on, but we know something really big and mean is inside that cage of steel and it’s very, very dangerous.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20794">Take a look at this sequence again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20795">Nothing is explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20796">All we can do is watch as one of the technicians is yanked and hurled around like a piece of lettuce in a tossed salad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20797">And at the end of the sequence we still don’t know what’s going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20798">But we’re hooked; that’s why in action-oriented films, or certain types of mysteries or thrillers, the writer opens with an action sequence that needs to be explained at some point during the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20799">It’s called the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20800">“inciting incident.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20801"> A primary rule in screenwriting is that we discover what’s going on at the same time the character does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20802">The main character and the reader or audience are connected by the mutual effort of trying to figure out what’s going on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20803">Things have to be explained; sometimes through words, sometimes through pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20804">It all depends on the type of screenplay you’re writing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20805">The premise established, we meet the main characters, Sam Neill and Laura Dern, in the Badlands of South Dakota, working the dinosaur digs, using the latest computer technology to isolate the fossil remains of some prehistoric animal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20806">A helicopter lands, bringing the Attenborough character, who convinces the two scientists that if they come with him and “sign off” on his project, he will fund their research digs for the next three years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20807">They can’t say no to that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20808">They do need funds to continue their research project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20809">So, they cannot “not” go.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20810">That’s the first ten pages of the screenplay; nothing is explained, but it’s all been set up, the situation demonstrated.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20811">Now the second ten pages of dramatic action begin, and here it becomes necessary to establish exposition; there is the need to explain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20812">As the characters drive through the open landscape, they see their first dinosaurs, living and breathing and roaming as they were during the Jurassic Period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20813">It’s like being lost on an island in time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20814">Again, as we see the explanation, we don’t need to explain it through dialogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20815">And this is where the questions of “how they do it” and “why they do it” become important and do need to be explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20816">That’s when we have the little interactive presentation explaining the science and technology, set amid the activity of the high-tech laboratory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20817">The other characters are introduced and now we’re ready to begin the “true” story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20818">At Plot Point I they enter Jurassic Park and the massive gates swing shut. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20819">Everything has been set up and explained, the characters introduced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20820">Some explanations are part of the visual arena; for example, when they enter the park they see a cow being hoisted into a compound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20821">The young girl is appalled as we hear a vicious roar, then witness a lot of activity within the trees and then we see the empty harness, broken and bloody, being lifted out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20822">Nothing needs to be said; no words are necessary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20823">It’s feeding time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20824">We see the same thing with a goat chained to a post. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20825">Sitting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20826">Waiting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20827">A short time later, after the storm hits, we see only the chain swinging back and forth, empty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20828">Then the T-rex is upon them.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20829">A screenplay is a story told with pictures, so we have to create the pictures that reveal the story and keep it moving forward; then exposition and the need to explain are kept at a minimum.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20830">The problem with so many screenwriters is that they rely too heavily on dialogue to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20831">In some screenplays, like the one mentioned at the front of this chapter, scene after scene deals with some kind of explanation about something that’s already happened.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20832">The result: the story moves too slowly, and seems to wander in several different directions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20833">And despite the characters’ constantly seeming to explain themselves, the impression is that they are not well-defined, are passive instead of active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20834">Washed out on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20835">In the story about the boat builder in the Caribbean, it became necessary for the screenwriter to explain everything because </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20836">certain scenes had been omitted in the story line</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20837">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20838">That makes it a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20839">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20840">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20841">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20842">Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20843"> the exposition is presented with a combination of visual elements in order to move the story forward; the introduction of the Sam Neill and Laura Dern characters on the fossil dig in the South Dakota Badlands shows us who these characters are, so the story doesn’t become bogged down in explanations, as the writers weave the threads of the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20844">When you’re writing a screenplay you have to explain things, that’s part of the nature of the medium, but the real question is in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20845">how you do it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20846">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20847">Whether through dialogue or pictures.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20998">It’s true that this is only one scene in the entire screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-20999">But look how indicative it is; the whole screenplay is written in this tone, and it lacks a force and an energy that should be driving a story like this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21000">Film is a visual medium and it must be approached both through its action and its character.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21053">When I’m reading a screenplay, I’m always looking for a story line that’s lean, clean, and tight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21054">I want the characters to move through the narrative landscape with a strong dramatic need and strong point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21055">I want to be surprised and don’t want the story to seem contrived or predictable, and I want all scenes and sequences to be related to one another, where nothing, neither a throwaway action nor a line of dialogue, is tossed in just to keep the story moving forward.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21056">It’s what I call “the good read.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21057">Unfortunately, I’m disappointed most of the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21058">The same goes for almost all the readers in Hollywood, no matter if it’s a studio executive, producer, director, development person, or reader. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21059">Personally, I’m directly involved in the reading and writing of about a thousand screenplays a year; either I’m commissioned to read them by various producers and production companies, or I’m working with my many students and helping them design and develop their screenplays. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21060">Over and over again I find certain tendencies within the screenplay that lead directly to a particular problem; as mentioned in </span><a href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21061">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21062">, either there is too much material fueling the story, or not enough; something is missing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21063">Many times during the screenwriting process the screenwriter is faced with the creative choice of whether to write a particular scene or not write it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21064">Sometimes a tendency develops where writers will skip scenes that they think are unimportant and unnecessary, scenes they think they could do without. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21065">If you find that you start asking yourself “whether I really need to write this scene or not,” you begin a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21066">critical process</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21067"> of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21068">making a judgment</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21069">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21070">And while that is a positive and necessary step in the screenwriting process, if overdone it can lead to a creative decision that results in your </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21071">not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21072"> writing the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21073">And once this process has been formed as part of the writing process, once you get into the pattern of saying, “No, I don’t need to write this scene,” for whatever reason—you establish the habit of saying no.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21074">Then you’re in trouble.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21075">Inevitably, something will be missing in the screenplay; most of the time it will be something important or significant to the action, a key scene or sequence that must be there for the story to move forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21076">When I was a consultant on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21077">White Palace</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21078"> (Alvin Sargent), with Susan Sarandon and James Spader, there was a significant transition at the end of the Second Act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21079">The James Spader character makes a decision to follow Susan Sarandon to New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21080">But the way the script was written did not give us any clue that the character was going to leave; there was a scene, and then the next scene showed him arriving in New York. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21081">How he got there, when he made the decision, why he made the decision, was never addressed during this particular draft of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21082">Just that he goes.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21083">When I first read this section of the script, I was very confused. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21084">It just didn’t make sense, especially in light of what happens between the two characters when they encounter each other again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21085">It was a major omission; without this key scene of the Spader character making the decision to leave and follow Sarandon to New York, there was a big, gaping hole in the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21086">It had to be filled. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21087">Such a scene was not only important, it was a structural necessity, for this scene is really the Plot Point at the end of the Second Act.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21088">When something is missing in the screenplay, either a scene or sequence, a character’s decision or reaction, it will always get in the way of the action, because we can intuitively feel something is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21089">not there</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21090"> that should be.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21091">One of my students was writing an action-adventure script about the rescue of an American airman who had been shot down and captured by a guerrilla force in North Korea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21092">And while there were many action scenes, literally one after the other, the writer had omitted saying anything about this character, about what his life was like before his capture, or his family, or what information he had, or his hopes and fears; even in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21093">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21094"> we see the Denzel Washington character at his daughter’s birthday party just before he receives the phone call about the Russian threat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21095">And in the setup of the Gene Hackman character something is said about the navy being his “real family.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21096">We also </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21097">see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21098"> his relationship with his dog, and that reveals a great deal about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21099">It’s not just action scene after action scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21100">Most of the character dynamic that makes a screenplay really effective, no matter if it’s an action-adventure, or thriller, or relationship story, was clearly missing in my student’s pages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21101">And it was pretty obvious.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21102">Good screenwriting is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21103">blend of strong action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21104"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21105">strong character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21106">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21107">They go hand in hand.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21108">How can you correct something like that? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21109">In this case I had my student stop his writing and go back and do more character work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21110">First I had him write several essays about the main character, then suggested some character elements that might be woven into the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21111">In my student’s story the main character is a loner; shot down behind enemy lines, captured, no one to talk to—this creates a situation where a flashback, or what I like to call a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21112">“flashpresent,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21113"> would work very well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21114">For example, as the character’s plane is plummeting to the earth we could possibly see, in very quick cuts, various elements of his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21115">As he yanks his ejector seat, we could possibly see bits and pieces of his life; a scene with his mother, maybe a shot of his wife, or a child playing with a little dog, or a beautiful sunset. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21116">These are just some visual suggestions that could open up the script so as to incorporate some character elements into the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21117">He parachutes into the trees, then there’s an action scene of him being hunted down and captured. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21118">The screenwriter had become so totally involved in the action elements of the screenplay that he had completely neglected the character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21119">Something was missing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21120">It was a real problem.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21121">Any creative decision you make about whether to write a particular scene or not is a necessary and essential step in the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21122">But following the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21123">question</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21124"> about whether or not you need the scene, instead of following what’s needed for the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21125">story</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21126"> to work, leads to a screenplay that reads “thin,” with no tension or suspense, and obvious </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21127">plot holes</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21128"> that need to be explained in order for the story to move forward.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21129">And failure to take care of and fill these particular </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21130">plot holes</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21131"> will often lead to stories, and characters, that are thin and one-dimensional. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21132">We call this type of screenplay a “one-line” film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21133">Sometimes, a one-line film works very effectively: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21134">Speed</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21135"> (Graham Yost) and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21136">Broken Arrow</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21137"> are good examples of an idea pushed to its extreme, with just enough character delineation to make it interesting. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21138">Il Postino</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21139"> is brilliant.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21140">But </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21141">The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21142"> is a good example of a “one-line” script that doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21143">The story, about an English surveyor and his partner, assigned to reclassify a hill into a mountain in Wales right after the First World War, is a cute premise, cleverly laid out, but extremely simple in terms of style and execution.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21144">The title says it all; that’s what the entire script is about, and there’s nothing more to it than this particular situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21145">That’s what this movie really is, a situation, not a story, and for that reason the conflict and tension inherent in the story seem lost; is this mountain really a hill, or is this hill really a mountain? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21146">That’s the only real tension that powers the story forward.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21147">The stakes are not high enough—that is, the emotional stakes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21148">What’s at stake in this story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21149">Not much of anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21150">The people here have nothing to lose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21151">To make it work more dramatically, more effectively, the emotional intensity has to be higher; that means the conflict has be increased. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21152">Something of value, whether emotional or physical, internal or external, has to be at stake, or at risk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21153">A character’s strong dramatic need will generate more conflict only if there are obstacles that must be overcome. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21154">If this is the case, you’ve got to go into the character’s life and find the element or elements that can raise the emotional stakes of the situation.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21155">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21156">Take a look at Anson, the Hugh Grant character; he is weak and passive and always seems to be reacting to the situation and other characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21157">We really don’t know too much about him, and he literally disappears into the background of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21158">There is nothing about his character, or in his character, to draw and focus our attention on him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21159">He has nothing at stake. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21160">The barkeeper, Morgan, on the other hand, is a much more dynamic character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21161">Even the character of the Reverend is portrayed with more gusto and life, and stands out more than Anson. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21162">The love relationship with the Betsy character seems predictable and contrived, as if it’s just thrown in because there has to be a “love interest” in every script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21163">And why she’s attracted to this shell-shocked wimp is, at least to my mind, a total mystery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21164">We know he was shell shocked, but we don’t know anything about him, and how this has affected him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21165">She is a strong and attractive woman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21166">Why would she consent to be with this kind of a man? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21167">Is she his savior? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21168">A rescuer? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21169">A distraught mother? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21170">We don’t know, we can only guess.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21171">So, what’s the problem?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21172">Something’s missing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21173">First of all, the main character is never really defined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21174">The conflict itself is weak and results in very little tension or suspense because the characters are always reacting to the situation; except for Morgan they are not driven by their passions and emotions, only by their need to make this particular hill fall into the category of being listed as a mountain.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21175">Why is that so important? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21176">This is the first hole that needs to be filled. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21177">It’s never really explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21178">They talk about it, yes, they discuss it, yes, but there is no underlying reason, or motivation, to take this simple conflict seriously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21179">As a result, the story is thin and contrived, the plot line weak. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21180">Why these Welsh people of Fynnor Gawr cared so much whether the “British” declared their summit a hill or a mountain is never really established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21181">This might have been a fierce struggle, storywise, for the Welsh are a proud and independent people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21182">Couldn’t there have been some kind of conflict spawned the English forcing their laws and their way of life upon the Welsh? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21183">The natural rivalry inherent in the story could have been the natural abrasion that might have added more depth and dimension to the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21184">If you feel your story is too thin, or missing something, or if the stakes are not high enough, or if you feel the characters are talking too much, or they all sound alike, or nothing happens, go back over the material and determine whether you’ve spent enough time setting up the conflict in the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21185">You can also add color, or create conflict and texture to your characterizations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21186">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21187">The Englishman…</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21188">the Hugh Grant character is weak because we don’t know enough about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21189">We don’t know much about his background, about how his shell-shock experience has affected him; we don’t know whether he longs for a secure and loving relationship, or must overcome a long and deep-seated conflict of prejudice against the Welsh. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21190">These are all potential areas of character conflict that might have been explored and expanded to offer a more interesting and dramatic dimension to the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21191">If these areas had been explored, the film would have been much more than a “one-liner.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21192">Sometimes, when the material is thin, and something seems to be missing, look for a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21193">subplot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21194"> to weave into the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21195">A subplot is an additional plotline that becomes a secondary branch of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21196">Adding a subplot is a good idea </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21197">sometimes</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21198">, and sometimes not, depending on the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21199">Many writers I know are convinced that every story needs a subplot, so they always try to find a way to inject one.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21200">There are two ways to approach creating a subplot; either adding another element to the narrative line of your script through the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21201">action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21202">, or building it from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21203">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21204">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21205">That’s your first creative decision, because all subplots are a function either of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21206">action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21207"> or of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21208">character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21209">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21210">The purpose of a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21211">subplot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21212"> is to add more solid dramatic possibilities to your story line; to open up the action so the script becomes more visual, and to fill in any pieces of missing action to sharpen and define the conflict.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21223">If you build your subplot based on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21224">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21225">, you will have to create more obstacles to the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21226">For example, if your character is a doctor who’s searching for a cure for AIDS, and he’s almost found it, you might think about creating a subplot about another doctor who is competing with the main character and possibly has found another cure for the same disease. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21227">In medical terms it’s important to be the first to discover a cure, because that’s what attracts the funding and research dollars. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21228">So, maybe the character’s dramatic need might be to be the first person to discover the cure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21229">This sets up an additional conflict where the main character is racing against, and challenging, this other character, to be the first to find the cure for AIDS. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21230">A subplot like this becomes a very effective way to add and build more dimension into the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21231">How would you go about building this particular subplot? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21232">First, you have to create the other character, in this case a doctor doing research with AIDS, and then find out who he or she is by writing a character biography. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21233">Maybe these two doctors have had some contact in the past, either before the story starts, or through various research publications; maybe they even went to school together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21234">You can establish this information through the character biography by writing various essays clarifying and defining the dramatic forces working on these two characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21235">This secondary character will be a major figure in the story, even if he or she is in only a few scenes in the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21236">Setting up a situation this way allows you to select scenes that will add depth to the plot.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21237">By clarifying and defining what brings a new character into the conflict, and how the main character reacts to this new situation, you generate a whole series of actions and reactions that will hook into the main story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21238">You are creating additional action to the story, a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21239">subplot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21240"> that will give the script a new look and feel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21241">Many writers actually develop the subplot as a separate story, then structure it on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21242">Paradigm</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21243"> and then weave it through the dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21244">That’s why it’s listed more as a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21245">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21246"> than of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21247">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21248">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21249">Whenever you feel you need to cut away from the main action, you can now insert scenes from the subplot and create a much stronger narrative line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21250">If you want to build a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21251">subplot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21252"> based on </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21253">action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21254">, here’s the perfect example: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21255">Ransom</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21256">, the Ron Howard film with Mel Gibson and Rene Russo, from an original script by Alexander Ignon, and rewritten by Richard Price </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21257">(Clockers)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21258">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21259">The script is about the kidnapping of a child of a wealthy family and the physical and emotion toll it takes upon them.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21260">In the first draft of the screenplay the action concentrated on the family and how they dealt with the ordeal, how it affected their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21261">The kidnapping was only the “hook” to focus on the characters during the time of their emotional ordeal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21262">And the point of the story was that people are all the same; rich or poor, man or woman, black, white, brown, or yellow, when the lives of children are at stake, the emotional reality experienced is really the same for everybody. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21263">Feelings are feelings.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21264">Which is basically the point of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21265">But when Richard Price came onto the project, he became aware that, while it was a great situation as written, something seemed to be missing; the script wasn’t as strong as it could be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21266">Ron Howard agreed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21267">When they reread the original material from this perspective, they became aware that during the entire screenplay there was nothing about the kidnappers, nothing about the kidnappers’ point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21268">Who are these people? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21269">Why did they kidnap this particular child? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21270">How does the kidnapping affect the parents </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21271">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21272"> the kidnappers? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21273">This is a bizarre and unique relationship that, if explored, could provide another dimension to the script.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21274">So Price started developing the kidnappers’ side of the story, and in the subplot we’re able to see who these people are and why they’ve chosen to commit this crime.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21450">Scripts that span a number of years, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21451">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21452">, are very difficult to write because the time frame is very long and there may be too many incidents that have to be covered and explained. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21453">There’s too much going on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21454">So when you’re working on a subject that covers a long period of time, you have to know what problems you’re going to be confronting.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21455">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21456"> is a script like this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21457">The story is a chronological time line that covers seven days, and what makes it difficult to write is that a series of events must happen that includes a multitude of details, and each one is contingent upon the others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21458">I understand that the first few drafts of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21459">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21460"> were more than two hundred pages long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21461">So what do you have to do to make it work effectively? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21462">If you’re not true to the “history” of the story, the circumstances and events, you’re bound to break the “willing suspension of disbelief,” and nobody will buy it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21463">It’s just not “real” or believable, and this becomes apparent immediately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21464">The music is there, but that’s about it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21465">So how do you approach the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21466">historical film</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21467"> or the period piece? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21468">A script based on actual characters and events? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21469">There are many ways to approach the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21470">historical screenplay</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21471">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21472">First, of course, you have to do the textual research, reading books, magazines, or newspapers of the time and subject, finding out all you can about the period, as well as the people and the forces of the times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21473">Personal diaries or novels of that period are also a good source. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21474">Once you’ve done the research, then you can place the historical facts into a progression of events that become the structural foundation of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21475">Then you have to decide how you’re going to end it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21476">What incident or event will resolve your story line most effectively? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21477">Is it based on an actual incident whose ending we already know, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21478">Apollo 13, All the President’s Men</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21479"> (William Goldman), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21480">Nixon?</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21481"> Or will you base the ending on some kind of commentary using a scrawl over the end credits, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21482">Dances With Wolves</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21483">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21484">In other words, how true do you have to be to history? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21485">And the answer is simple: Be true to the facts, and the events of history, but the motivations that drive the characters can be created and entirely fictional.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21486">Immortal Beloved</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21487"> (Bernard Rose) is a script like this: if you know anything at all about Beethoven’s life, you’ll know that the events shown were obviously fabricated; if you look for “the real” Beethoven in that script, you’ll have a hard time finding him.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21488">If you happen to be writing a script like this, a historical or period piece, and you find that your script is too long, and too episodic, or you have too many characters, or too much seems to be going on, the first question you have to ask yourself is not “What do I keep in?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21489">but </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21490">“What do I leave out?”</span></i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21491">It’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21492">the</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21493"> major creative decision that must be made before you even begin to approach the story, or the rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21494">If you don’t ask yourself this question, it often leads to difficulties and raises many problems, most notably </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21495">selectivity</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21496">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21497">What events </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21498">do I need</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21499"> to tell the story in the most visually effective way, and then, what can I leave out?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21500">One of the ways to solve this particular problem is by using </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21501">transitions</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21502">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21503">The passage of time and the link between the scenes and sequences has to be conceived visually, for moving the action from one scene to the next requires a visual transition. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21504">Transitions</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21505"> bridge time and move the action forward quickly, visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21506">Whether you’re writing an original screenplay, or adapting a novel, play, magazine, or news article, each piece of film, each scene or sequence, must bridge a particular </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21507">time</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21508"> to a particular </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21509">place</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21510"> in order to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21511">To go from Point A to Point B in a screenplay requires making transitions that connect the two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21512">If you don’t make those transitions, then you may wind up with many of the symptoms that are on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21513">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21514">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21515">There are four major ways to make </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21516">transitions:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21517"> cutting from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21518">picture to picture, sound to sound, music to music, or special effect to special effect</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21519">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21520">There can be </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21521">dissolves, fadeouts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21522">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21523">smash cuts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21524">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21525">It wasn’t too long ago that the screenwriter depended on the director or film editor to create these visual transitions, but at the present time most of the working screenwriters know that it is the writer’s responsibility to write the required transitions from scene to scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21526">One of the recognizable traits of the screenwriter in the nineties is his or her ability to write good visual transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21527">And at the present time there seems to be an evolution in the style and sophistication of the art of transition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21528">Even a script like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21529">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21530">, which is sequential and episodic, uses effective transitions so the five episodes that make up the screenplay seem to be connected into a single story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21531">The title page even proclaims the script is really “three stories about one story.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21532">If Tarantino and Avary had not created those transitions, the script would have been disjointed and episodic and not worked as well as it does.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21533">As far as I’m concerned, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to write these transitional scenes that move the story forward and bridge time and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21534">Writing good transitions is also a very good way to solve a number of problems.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21535">Transitions have always been an integral part of the screenwriting process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21536">From the earliest days of silent movies the craft of filmmaking has always been the same: to tell a story in pictures, building it from beginning to end with little bits and pieces of film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21537">That’s what a screenplay is: a story told with pictures.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21538">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21539">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21540">, for example, the passage of time is handled incredibly well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21541">Only one shot is needed to tell us the passage of time: the large posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, and Raquel Welch visually indicate that several decades have passed by. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21542">That, and some music on the soundtrack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21543">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21544">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21545"> a young woman of twenty-six is kneeling down looking at a book and we hear her in voice-over narration: “How do two separate people fuse into this thing called a couple? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21546">And if your love is that strong, then how do you still keep a little room for yourself…?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21547">That’s what the whole film is about, and when Finn stands up, we match-cut to her as a little girl of five or six years standing up looking at the women in the quilting bee as her narration leads us directly into the story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21548">Why are transitions so important? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21549">Because when you’re reading a script, or seeing a movie, it has to flow smoothly across a time period that is usually not more than two hours. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21550">The story line has to be a seamless parade of images across the page or screen, and time becomes a relative phenomenon; days and years and decades can be condensed into seconds, a few seconds stretched into minutes, as a leap is made from one image to another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21551">That’s one of the things that make </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21552">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21553"> such a remarkable movie; the passage of time does not draw attention to itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21554">It becomes an integral part of the fabric of the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21555">Transitions can be as varied and as multiple as the colors in a kaleidoscope. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21556">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21557">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21558">, for example, the screenwriter, Ted Tally, generally plays the last line of one scene over the first line of the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21559">The dialogue is used to bridge time and action and shows one way that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21560">sound</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21561"> can be the link connecting two different scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21562">Tally ends one scene with a question, then opens the next scene by answering that question.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21563">This kind of overlapping transition scene has been done many times before, of course, most notably in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21564">Julia</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21565">, Alvin Sargent’s Academy Award–winning screenplay adapted from Lillian Hellman’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21566">Pentimento</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21567">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21568">But the way Tally approached his transitions pushes the boundaries of the medium in such a way that we’re not even aware of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21569">If you’re watching a movie and become aware of the visual transitions, or feel the “arty” influence of the director in each scene, chances are it’s not a very good film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21570">The style and sophistication of the transition is evolving all the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21571">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21572">Lone Star</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21573">, John Sayles makes his transitions bridging time and action in a very unique way: he has the characters remain in present time, then pans the camera over to a character or a place and suddenly we have moved across time, either forward or backward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21574">It’s very effective, extremely visual, and I think shows the remarkable versatility of Sayles as a writer and director.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21575">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21576"> is a film based on an actual historic event, and the screenwriters bridge the action by simply cutting back and forth—a technique called </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21577">cross-cutting</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21578">—among the three astronauts in the spacecraft and the Mission Control team in Houston. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21579">The story moves forward by action/reaction, and is held together by the events and circumstances. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21580">Thelma &amp; Lou</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21581">ise also moves forward by cross-cutting between the two women on the run and the policeman searching for them.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21582">Every screenplay has its own particular style and form in terms of transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21583">An action film usually has short, quick transitions, because the film moves forward at a very rapid pace and we have to be swept up into the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21584">But in a character-driven piece the transitions could possibly come from silence, or looks between the characters, or dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21585">There is never </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21586">any one right way</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21587"> to make transitions. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21588">The only criterion is whether it works or not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21589">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21590">There may be times when you’re so engrossed in putting the story down on paper that you don’t even think about the transitional flow of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21591">But when you finish the first or second draft, you find that you’ve written a screenplay that may be 145 pages or longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21592">During the actual screenwriting process that’s okay, but afterward you’re going to have to do a lot of work to cut it to a proper length. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21593">A 140-plus page screenplay is only accepted if it’s by William Goldman, Quentin Tarantino, David Koepp, or Eric Roth.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21594">If your screenplay is too long, and you feel there’s too much going on, too many things happening, or too many characters, look for ways to bridge the time and action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21595">Transitions solve so many problems in screenwriting and sometimes the bridge to another time, or another place, can be as simple as changing the character’s clothes, or using match cuts, or changing the weather, or using holidays to condense the time and action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21596">One of the most interesting films to use transitions as an integral part of the story is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21597">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21598">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21599">This is a unique film in many respects, but what’s especially interesting is the way Tarantino and Roger Avary created the transitions to keep the film flowing smoothly in one single time line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21600">As the title-page reads, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21601">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21602"> is really “three stories about one story.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21603">The first page of the screenplay is “The Table of Contents,” and states that there is a prologue, where the holdup begins (with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) then a story called “Vincent and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife,” another called “The Gold Watch,” and the last story, “Vincent, Jules, Jimmie, and the Wolf” (in the film the title’s been changed to “The Bonnie Situation”), which leads us into the Epilogue and the conclusion of the robbery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21604">The use of a Prologue, which opens the script, and the Epilogue, which closes it, is called a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21605">“bookend”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21606"> device; the opening scene or sequence leads into the story and the last part of the scene or sequence closes it. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21607">The Bridges of Madison County</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21608"> (Richard LaGravenese) is another example of the use of a “bookend” opening and closing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21609">Despite all the five specific episodes that make up the script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21610">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21611">, it really seems like one story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21612">Why?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21613">Because of the transitions.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21614">All the transitions in this screenplay are character driven, and the reason the film works so effectively is that the three stories are woven together with these characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21615">Even though it is “three stories about one story,” the focal point always seems to be Vincent, the John Travolta character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21616">The film opens in the restaurant with Tim Roth—Pumpkin—and his girlfriend, Honeybunny (Amanda Plummer); they pull out their guns and the robbery begins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21617">We freeze at this point, then cut to Vincent and Jules driving somewhere having one of their many weighty and lengthy discussions about the difference between McDonald’s restaurants here and abroad. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21618">They seem like two nice guys until they open the trunk, pull out several guns, and make their way inside an apartment building. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21619">Their actions seem to contradict their dialogue, which makes them interesting and colorful characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21620">They walk up the stairs, stake out a room, all the time continuing their discussion about the moral and ethical complications of a “foot massage.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21621">Especially Marcellus’s wife Mia’s foot massage which left the “masseur” with a very “severe speech problem.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21622">It is this attitude of casual nonchalance that is so effective in the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21623">There have been all kinds of essays and comments and literary debates about </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21624">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21625">, and they reveal the extent to which movies have become the social fingerprints of our time.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21626">The two hit men force their way inside the room and confront the four young men who tried to rip off Marcellus Wallace and not deliver what they said they were going to deliver, the mysterious briefcase with the light inside, and the combination 666, the devil’s numbers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21627">(In Hitchcockian terms, the briefcase and what’s inside would be called the “McGuffin.”) As Jules quotes from the Bible (another nice character touch), Vincent and Jules kill three of the four guys in a very explosive scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21628">When Brett, one of the four, leaps out of the bathroom with his gun blazing, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21629">missing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21630"> Vincent and Jules, it becomes “a fucking miracle,” and then we cut to:</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21631">Marcellus’s bar, where the “boss” is telling Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer, to take a fall in the fifth round of his fight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21632">Butch agrees, reluctantly, to deliberately lose the fight, then goes to the bar for a pack of cigarettes and is joined by Vincent, who has just arrived (wearing the funny clothes he wears in story #3), and the two exchange some words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21633">They don’t like each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21634">Vincent is called in to the boss, Marcellus, who gives him an order: take his wife out to dinner.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21635">At this point we have a choice; in terms of story we can either follow Butch, or Vincent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21636">We follow Vincent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21637">We set up the encounter between Vincent and Mia when he scores some “great” heroin, and then follow him as he takes Mia out to dinner in a long and bizarre sequence, ending with her overdosing on heroin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21638">Vincent saves her, they say their good-byes to a “memorable” evening, and we go into:</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21639">The second story, titled “The Gold Watch.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21640">The transition between these two stories is simply to Fade Out at the end of the Vincent/Mia sequence, and Fade In on a flashback sequence of a young Butch being told the story of his father’s gold watch that he had carried up his ass for more than six years in a Vietnamese POW camp. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21641">When the young boy reaches to take the watch, Butch wakes up in his dressing room just before the fight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21642">We know Butch was supposed to take a fall, but we actually don’t see the fight; we cut to the taxi driver listening to the results. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21643">We hear on the driver’s radio that a fighter has died, then we see Butch leap into a Dumpster, then into the cab, and make his way to a motel, where his girlfriend is waiting for him.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21644">She has forgotten the gold watch at his apartment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21645">Furious, he realizes he must go back and retrieve it, even though it may cost him his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21646">He has double-crossed Marcellus and he knows there will be a contract on him (executed by Vincent and Jules). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21647">Sure enough, when he returns to the apartment, and retrieves the sacred watch, Vincent emerges from the bathroom and Butch blows him away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21648">Which is perhaps the most arresting moment in the film, because the scene is out of its normal time frame. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21649">It’s a nonlinear action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21650">And, occurring as it does in the middle of the script, it breaks the normal linear thread of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21651">This “nonlinear” structure is what has been so instrumental in the success of the film, and become the inspiration for many others coming up in the latter part of the nineties.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21652">Butch escapes in his little VW and at a stoplight sees Marcellus and literally runs over him in his efforts to get away. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21653">In the ensuing somewhat comedic escape, both men are captured by two goon brothers, Ned and Zed, who lock them up in order to sodomize them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21654">Butch escapes, but decides he cannot let Marcellus remain in the hands of these two goonies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21655">He rescues him, again at the peril of his own life, and when Marcellus grants him a pardon, he promises to leave with his girlfriend, never to be seen again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21656">As Mia and Vincent have agreed to reveal nothing about what happened at dinner, Marcellus and Butch make an agreement not to say anything about this incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21657">Life is a compromise.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21658">Which then brings us to the third story, “Vincent, Jules, Jimmie, and the Wolf,” though in the film the title’s been changed to “The Bonnie Situation.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21659">Bonnie is Jimmie’s wife, the nurse who is expected home within the hour. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21660">And Jimmie (played by Tarantino) is not going to jeopardize his marriage by his wife finding a dead man in the garage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21661">It’s a situation that needs to be handled by the Wolf, the Harvey Keitel character whom we heard Marcellus mention at the end of the previous story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21662">The story begins at the end of the opening section after the Prologue, in what is really an overlapping scene from another point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21663">When Jules kills the first man, the character Brett, whom we have not seen before, has been in the bathroom, a gun in hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21664">He listens to Jules spouting the Bible in the living room and then we hear gunshots. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21665">Muttering to himself, Brett leaps out of the bathroom firing six times at Jules and Vincent and misses each time; the bullets thud harmlessly into the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21666">As Jules says, “It’s a fuckin’ miracle,” and he becomes obsessed with the fact that they’re still alive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21667">“This is some serious shit,” he says as they drive away, the other character, Marvin, being held “captive” in the backseat. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21668">They become engrossed in an illuminating conversation, Jules declaring that they’ve survived “only by divine intervention”; Vincent disagrees, and when he turns to get Marvin’s opinion, the gun he’s holding accidentally fires and Marvin’s head is blown all over the car.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21669">In a panic Jules calls his friend Jimmie and they go there to clean up the car and get rid of the body. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21670">A quick call to Marcellus produces “The Wolf,” and he comes to their rescue and saves the day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21671">The job done, the body and the car both disposed of, the two of them are hungry and go get some breakfast.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21672">That, of course, is the transition that leads to the coffee shop that Tim Roth and his girlfriend are going to rob. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21673">As they are having breakfast and continuing their discussion, Vincent goes to the bathroom, and when he’s gone the robbery begins, so we begin this action a little bit before it ended in the Prologue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21674">Another nice use of nonlinear structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21675">The two of them thwart the holdup, permit Pumpkin and Honeybunny to leave, and then leave themselves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21676">The end.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21677">This nonlinear structure works very well within the framework of the three stories, Epilogue, and Prologue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21678">It is really what makes the film so interesting and appealing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21679">Just for the sake of an exercise we could put these three stories, along with the Prologue and Epilogue, into a linear story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21680">We might open with Vincent and Jules on their way to kill the kids who were trying to rip off Marcellus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21681">They leave, accidentally kill Marvin, go to the “Jules, Vincent, Jimmie, and the Wolf” sequence, which would be followed by their breakfast, leading to the Prologue and Epilogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21682">We follow them to the Marcellus bar scene of the first story, where Vincent and Butch meet; we would follow Vincent to Mia and their night out, then end with Butch and the gold watch, with Vinnie’s death and Butch’s escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21683">Yes, it would work, but it certainly would not be as effective as it is now.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21684">It is the transitions between these stories that really hold it all together; they make the screenplay work, bridging both linear time and narrative line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21685">All the characters are introduced and set up from the beginning, and these characters are the links that connect the three stories, even though they are told in a nonlinear way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21686">The “wackiness” of the characters (their discussions and the dialogue are wonderful), along with the bizarre humor of the stories, makes </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21687">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21688"> the entertaining and highly influential film it is and, I think, will continue to be.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21689">Different kinds of films require different kinds of transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21690">An action or action-adventure film like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21691">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21692"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21693">Mission: Impossible</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21694"> (David Koepp and Robert Towne), requires swift transitions, sharp, dynamic bridges that keep the pace flowing fast and smooth, so the reader and viewer are swept into a torrent of movement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21695">Look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21696">Twister</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21697">, simply a one-line story of storm chasers; it is the four storm sequences that really hold the film together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21698">So everything in the story acts as a transition leading into the next storm.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21699">A character piece, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21700">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21701"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21702">The Bridges of Madison County</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21703">, requires a different kind of transitional connection, a smooth and careful sculpting of transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21704">In a comedy the transitions from one scene to the next might be capped with one-liners, but they must be character driven or humor driven in order to move the story forward in a funny and seamless way.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21705">Transitions in a biographical or historical screenplay present a problem of selectivity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21706">How do you weave what might be a number of historical incidents into a 120-page screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21707">If you simply string the character’s life story, or a series of events, in chronological order, it becomes nothing more than a filmed essay; first this happens, then that happens, then this other thing happens, and so on until the character dies or something significant takes place that leads to an ending we already know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21708">As in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21709">Nixon</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21710">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21711">Apollo 13</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21712">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21713">Gandhi</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21714">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21715">Recently I had the opportunity of working with a Brazilian writer-director on a screenplay about the famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21716">The writer did not want simply to show a biographical chronology of events, so he chose to write the screenplay like a free-association collage, fragmented bits and pieces of the composer’s life presented in a nonlinear fashion like some kind of visual jigsaw puzzle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21717">That way, he explained to me, he hoped to make the composer’s life both visual and interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21718">But, he confided, he felt very insecure about the script; he didn’t know whether it worked or not.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21719">When I first read the material I thought it an interesting presentation, but unfortunately, the script didn’t work; it was a hard and difficult read because I didn’t know </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21720">what</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21721"> was going on; I didn’t know what the story was about and it was hard to get a grasp of the main character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21722">My problem was “how to fix it,” how to keep the writer’s style and subject matter intact but also to tell the story of the composer, the subject of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21723">At first I thought this was a structural problem, but when I went back over the material, trying to isolate and define the historical moments of the character’s life, I realized that the main character seemed to disappear off the page; that’s when I realized that it was really a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21724">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21725">, because the events of his life seemed to overshadow him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21726">The women in his life seemed to dominate him, the smaller characters seemed larger than he was, and there seemed to be too many events going on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21727">When I took it apart, I saw the screenplay really focused on five major periods of the composer’s life, and it was these “parts” that were broken up and placed in various sections of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21728">I had the impression that the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21729">main character got lost on the page</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21730">, for he literally disappeared from the action, even though it was his story and he was the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21731">The main character always seemed to be reacting to the events of his life, and not creating them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21732">The main character in a screenplay always has to be active; he or she must </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21733">cause</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21734"> things to happen.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21735">A biographical film like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21736">Gandhi</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21737">, for example, covers only a few events of his life, yet the conflict the character confronts and endures is encapsulated in two or three events and they become the structural foundation the script is built upon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21738">The film covers only three major periods in Gandhi’s life: as a young attorney fighting for social causes; then formulating and embracing his philosophy and practice of “passive resistance”; then trying to mend the Hindu-Muslim disputes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21739">Gandhi’s murder and death “bookend” the film, very much like the bookend Prologue and Epilogue in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21740">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21741">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21742">The Brazilian script, as fragmented as it was, really dealt with these five periods of the composer’s life: his childhood, his struggles to get his music performed; the two women in his life; his world fame; and his final acceptance of old age.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21743">As I started going through the script again, I found that I could isolate and define these five areas of his life, but there seemed to be several key scenes missing, scenes needed to highlight and accent those periods of the composer’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21744">And it was these key scenes, I felt—discovering the source of his inspiration, meeting his second wife, overcoming those incredible obstacles to get his music performed, and so on—which became the Plot Points, or anchors, the basic glue that held the script together.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-21745">Good transitions in a screenplay should never really be noticed; they should disappear into the visual narrative like the individual threads that make up a piece of cloth.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22247">There are times during the screenwriter’s journey when the story works well, with a tense and dramatic plot, and all the characters seem to have interesting backgrounds, but there’s a nagging sense that the dialogue is thin, maybe “tinny,” filled with clichés, and doesn’t seem to go anywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22248">Something seems not to be working, and you really can’t put your finger on what it is; maybe you’ve had the script read by a few friends or associates, and they tell you they “like it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22249">When you press them further, more often than not they point to the dialogue and say it may need polishing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22250">You hear this quite a bit in Hollywood, especially among development executives, and when they encounter this problem their solution is to bring in another writer to rewrite the dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22251">Writing is rewriting, and sometimes as many as twelve writers are brought in to “hone and polish” the project.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22252">Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22253">The Rock</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22254"> is a case in point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22255">The original screenplay, written by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook, was a really strong screenplay in terms of plot and character, it was just the dialogue that seemed to be flat and one-dimensional and didn’t seem to be working as well as it could. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22256">It had an exciting premise, good characters, interesting backgrounds, and pretty obviously had the potential to be a good “thump-and-pump” movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22257">Another writer, Mark Rosner, was brought in to rewrite the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22258">He did a draft and that is what attracted the director, Michael Bay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22259">But when Bay came on the project he thought the dialogue needed more of a “spin,” so he brought in Jonathan Hensleigh to make it more contemporary and bring it up to date.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22260">Hensleigh worked hand in hand with the director for months, honing and polishing the dialogue, and was on the set every day just in case he was needed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22261">When the film was completed the credits were established, and then the screenplay went to the arbitration panel at the Writers Guild of America. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22262">The panel consists of three screenwriters, independent of each other, who read the screenplay from the inception to the final draft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22263">Each writer’s contribution is measured and analyzed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22264">In some cases the arbitration panel will read fifteen different drafts of the screenplay, contrasting and comparing each one with the final product. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22265">Then they’ll award the screenwriting credits based on how they see each writer’s contribution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22266">In the case of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22267">The Rock</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22268"> it was determined that the original writers should get the screen credit, and not Jonathan Hensleigh.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22269">That decision sparked a real debate within the creative community. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22270">The director was outraged, as were a number of other people in Hollywood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22271">He insisted that Hensleigh receive a credit, and rightfully so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22272">Didn’t rewriting the dialogue warrant a screen credit?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22273">Yes and no.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22274">The Writers Guild of America, the WGA, has determined that a screenwriter can only receive a screenwriting credit if he or she has rewritten fifty percent or more of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22275">So when a new writer is brought in he or she, in most cases, will alter the structure, add new locations, create new scenes and characters, while trying to keep, hopefully, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22276">idea</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22277"> of the screenplay that was originally purchased by the studio or production company.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22278">What’s the point of all this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22279">Dialogue is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22280">function of character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22281">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22282">It’s true that some writers have a better ear for writing dialogue than others; they’re just born with a natural talent and ability, and it’s really a gift. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22283">But if you know your character well enough, if you feel comfortable inside his or her skin, the dialogue will be individual and appropriate and capture the “essence” of that character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22284">The dialogue may not be that great, but it’ll still work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22285">The function of dialogue, remember, is simple; dialogue either moves the story forward or reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22286">You can say things, explain things, or show things in order to reveal character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22287">If you look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22288">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22289">, most of the symptoms listed there deal with dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22290">After all, dialogue is one of the most striking qualities about your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22291">It tells us who he or she is, sets up the exposition, moves the story forward, adds humor, and can be one of the elements used in transitions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22292">If you think your dialogue is too thin, or your characters all sound alike, or if you explain too much, the best way to solve the problem is to go back to the beginning and rethink your character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22293">One of the ways to accomplish this is by doing an exercise I call the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22294">“Circle of Being.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22295"> It’s a process, really, a process that allows you uncover some kind of an incident or event in your character’s life that emotionally parallels and impacts the story line; it’s an event that happens to your main character when he or she is between the ages of ten and sixteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22296">This is an age period where some kind of traumatic event could conceivably occur that would affect the entire course of your character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22297">It might be the death of a parent, or of a loved one; it could be physical abuse that results in a deep emotional scar; it could be a physical event or injury, or quite possibly a move to a new city or country.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22303">If you think about it, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22304">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22305"> is a valuable exercise, or a tool, that you can use in crafting, enriching, and enhancing your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22306">If you go into your character’s life and ask yourself what traumatic incident might have occurred to him or her between the ages of ten and sixteen, see what happens.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22307">Why ten and sixteen? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22308">Because it happens to be a very important age in a person’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22309">The noted behaviorist Joseph Chilton Pierce states that there are four major growths, or spurts, of human intelligence in our lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22310">The first occurs when the child is about a year old, when he or she learns to walk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22311">The second spurt occurs about age four, when the child learns that he or she has an identity, as a boy or a girl, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22312">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22313"> has a given name; when the four-year-old acts, there is a response, and at that age he/she belongs to a family, and these are his/her parents and he/her lives in this house in this city. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22314">At this age, the child is able to communicate his or her needs.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22315">The third stage, or spurt, in the growth of human intelligence occurs when the child is about nine or ten; that’s the age when he or she understands that he has a definite personality, a singular and individual voice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22316">The young person is learning to question authority, forming his or her own opinions, and starting “speaking his mind.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22317">This is a very vital time in the life of the child.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22318">The fourth stage in the growth of human intelligence, and the most important developmental spurt, according to Pierce, occurs when the person is about fifteen or sixteen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22319">The teenager. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22320">That’s the age when the teenager rebels against everything and tries to find his/her own voice, suddenly understands that his parents are no longer the center of the universe, and looks outward into the world for role models, seeking forms of behavior, like clothes or hair, that are acceptable to his peers and express who they are. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22321">They have an identity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22322">Just look at your own kids, or your brother’s or sister’s kids or your friends’ kids, and look at how they dress, how they act and react, what kind of music they’re listening to, their slang and manner of speaking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22323">It’s a period of life that is so influential in a person’s life that it will form a subconscious identity, or impression, for the rest of their life, much as furniture leaves impressions in the rug. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22324">Take a moment to see how strong this impression is in your own life; close your eyes and go back to that time when you were about fifteen or sixteen, and see what incident or event affected you the most. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22325">What was the incident or event that springs to mind? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22326">If you want, play some music from that time and see what memories it brings up, and then take a moment to see how some particular incident from that period has affected you and possibly changed your life.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22423">Recently, I was commissioned to oversee the writing of a screenplay about a Native American warrior from the Oneida Nation, one of the six member nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, called the “Longhouse,” and their divided loyalties between the American colonists and the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22424">The main character is forced, literally against his will, into a situation where he has to align himself with the colonists in their war against the British. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22425">The immediate result, which is historically accurate, was a situation in which brother fought against brother, family against family; the ultimate result, unfortunately, was the confiscation of the Indian lands, the entire Northeastern part of the U.S., by the American government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22426">It’s a story of divided loyalties, a story of fate and destiny, and based on a historical incident.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22427">But the facts of this warrior’s life were thin, almost nonexistent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22428">What was known was that he sided with the colonists, but why he did so was never answered, and that was a question that had to be answered dramatically.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22429">This was the situation: It is well known historically that the Iroquois Confederacy wanted to remain neutral in this conflict; the elders declared that a war of this kind, a war of rebellion, was like an argument between a father and son. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22430">And anyone who takes sides in this kind of conflict becomes party to a no-win situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22431">If the Confederacy sided with the British, in this case the father, and the son was defeated and lay broken and bleeding on the battlefield, the father would hate the people who had done it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22432">On the other hand, if the Confederacy sided with the son, the colonists, and the father was vanquished and suffering in defeat, the Indian nations would alienate all their British friends. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22433">So the best thing to do, they decided, was to stay neutral.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22434">So that’s what they did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22435">Until the British army, bearing gifts of rum and trinkets, persuaded a prominent member of the Mohawk nation to join them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22436">He then convinced several of his brothers to side with the British. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22437">And, when the British army started their march toward Albany, they were aided by these Mohawk warriors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22438">In their first battle they attacked a colonial fort where the Oneida women and children, their cousins, had taken refuge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22439">Historically, that’s correct. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22440">Again, would that action alone make the Oneida warrior align himself with the colonists?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22441">Not necessarily so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22442">My partner in this project didn’t really know how to solve this particular situation, so I suggested that she create a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22443">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22444"> for the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22445">I told her to start from the character’s life and the known historical facts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22446">The warrior was born the son of an Oneida woman and a German settler. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22447">So what event might have happened to the main character during his youth, say, around the age of fifteen?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22448">If you look at the significance of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22449">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22450">, it can be a defining incident that embraces all those internal, external, emotional, physical, and background forces working on the character’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22451">What kind of incident would make the warrior turn against his own friends and relatives? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22452">There are many answers to this question, of course, but one particular solution (a created, dramatic incident) worked very well; when the warrior was a young man, say about fifteen, he watched his father die at the hands of some drunken British soldiers, and then they burned their meager crops and the houses they were living in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22453">Contrived? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22454">Yes, but historically, it was not all that uncommon for an incident like this to happen, especially at that time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22455">In dramatic terms it worked very well, and it’s an incident that really doesn’t have to be explained during the screenplay, as long as the writer </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22456">knows</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22457"> it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22458">In this case the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22459">Circle-of-Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22460"> incident is referred to only once, and all the emotional choices and decisions the character makes follow from that significant event.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22618">As they eat, she launches into a conversation about what Book’s sister (Patti LuPone) had told her about him; she told Rachel that “you [Book] should get married and have children of your own. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22619">Instead of trying to be a father to hers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22620">Except she thinks you’re afraid of the responsibility.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22621">“Oh,” Book replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22622">“Anything else?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22623">“Oh, yes,” Rachel continues, getting into it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22624">“She thinks you like policing because you think you’re right about everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22625">And you’re the only one who can do anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22626">And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a…um…bag of elbows. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22627">Yes, I think that’s what she said.”</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22733">First, change the style of your writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22734">Don’t try to write complete, literary sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22735">Focus on short, descriptive passages, maybe one-word sentences, where the words are used to accentuate color and humor to the reader. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22736">Shane Black (</span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22737">Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22738">, among others) uses dynamic and imaginative writing in his work; for example, in a car-chase sequence with the cars squirreling through traffic and racing down sidewalks scattering pedestrians, the cars scrape each other; and the way he describes it is short, visual, and concise: “The cars trade paint.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22739">It’s a great way to convey the thrill of the chase.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22740">If you’re writing more of a character piece, go back and redefine your characters by writing short two- or three-page essays dealing with the character relationships. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22741">Look for ways to strengthen your characters to make them more interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22742">Go into their professional life, their personal life, and their private life, what they do when they’re alone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22743">That means hobbies, gardening, exercise classes, raising pets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22744">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22745">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22746"> the little dog the Gene Hackman character takes everywhere adds to and expands the characterization.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22852">First, some practical pointers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22853">Nothing turns a reader off more than having to read thick and dense single-line paragraphs that fill up half to three quarters of a page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22854">To support the reader, make sure your descriptive paragraphs are not longer than four or five sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22855">If you’ve laced your script with long descriptive paragraphs, break them up into shorter paragraphs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22856">Make sure the descriptive prose is not too “thick,” or “dense”; a good screenplay should have a lot of white space on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22857">You don’t have to cut the material, just break it up into new paragraphs every four or five sentences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22858">So many times a screenwriter will write a thick descriptive paragraph that fills up most of the page and it just stops the reading process cold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22859">Lean, clean, and tight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22860">That’s what you want in your screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22861">What else can you do to remove the element of “boring”?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22862">Check your writing style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22863">You want to write in an active, present-tense style, so make your descriptive sentences shorter, tighter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22864">Check the dialogue; is it too wordy, too long, and too explanatory? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22865">Cut it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22866">Be ruthless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22867">Either dialogue moves the story forward or it reveals character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22868">If it doesn’t satisfy these two requirements, cut it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22869">After you’ve done this, see if there are places in the text where you can add some kind of action, either a car chase or a kiss; just know that whatever action you choose has to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22870">fit within the fabric of your story line</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22871">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22872">Obviously, you can’t add something without reason, or something that doesn’t fit, or something that’s completely out of context. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22873">If you check your material carefully you might find a few places where an action sequence, or some humor, might help to relieve the heaviness or density of the reading experience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22874">After you’ve made that assessment, move into individual scenes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22875">Are there places where your characters are just talking heads, sitting in a restaurant, driving a car, or walking through a park? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22876">What are they doing during the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22877">What’s happening around them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22878">For example, if they’re sitting in a restaurant having an intense conversation, give them something to do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22879">Let them be eating shrimp, for example, or corn on the cob, or let a tooth chip or break; or let the character be coming down with a cold; try to add something to the detail of the scene that the characters have to deal with. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22880">If your characters are driving in a car, let another driver cut them off and maybe the driver overreacts, so you’ve now got two things going on at the same time; the conversation as well as the reaction to the other driver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22881">This adds depth and tension to the action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22882">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22883">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22884">, when Andy Dufresne has locked himself in the warden’s office and is playing the operatic aria, the guards and warden are banging on the door. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22885">Two different things are going on simultaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22886">So look for ways to incorporate any kind of secondary action into your scenes.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22887">When Andy makes contact with Red for the first time, Red is playing catch with a baseball and this action continues through the entire scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22888">Give your characters something to do during the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22889">You don’t have to explain anything, just show it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22890">There will be times when a dialogue scene isn’t working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22891">No matter what you do, or how many times you change the character’s lines, the scene just doesn’t seem to gel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22892">If this is the case, there are a few things you can do: number one, go into the scene and clarify its elements. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22893">Define the purpose of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22894">What is the dramatic need of the main character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22895">What does he or she want during the scene; what is he or she doing there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22896">Where did the character come from before the scene began? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22897">Where is he or she going after the scene is over? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22898">You don’t have to write this information into the scene, or explain it, but you, the writer, must know it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22899">Don’t assume anything; clarify and define the character’s dramatic need until there’s no question in your mind about what happened before the scene began and what’s going to happen after it’s over.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22900">If the scene or sequence still isn’t working, there’s something else you can do: switch the lines of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22901">If Bill’s the main character and he’s in the scene with his ex-girlfriend, Sally, and he wants something from her, some information, or a package, whatever, simply switch the lines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22902">Give Bill’s lines to Sally and Sally’s lines to Bill and see what happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22903">If that doesn’t work, rewrite the scene and change the character’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22904">If Bill is the main character, and Sally is a major or minor character, write the scene from Sally’s point of view and let Bill be the secondary character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22905">That means you have to enter the scene from Sally’s point of view and see the purpose of the scene through her eyes.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22906">This is an amazing little exercise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22907">It removes any resistance you might have to the scene, and somehow dissolves the blocks that keep it from working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22908">Once you’ve written the scene this way, go back and rewrite it from Bill’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22909">See what happens.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22910">These little things can literally change the tone and texture of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-22911">They can add depth and dimension to the scenes so the reading experience does not end up being dull, thin, and boring.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23015">Opposing him, of course, was the good guy, Seagal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23016">The portrait of the Seagal character is the perfect expression of the passive active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23017">As the main character he’s the strong, silent type, a man who doesn’t talk too much, a man who wants to avoid trouble, except when pushed too far, and only then will he react and take action—and as we see, he’s a character who can literally do everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23018">Whether it’s putting out the oil fire single-handed, or being a master of martial arts, or breaking into a computer and uncovering secret passwords, or protecting the rights of a drunken and downtrodden Eskimo. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23019">He is a man who is reacting to the situations caused by others, the bad guys. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23020">And all this is shown in the first fifteen minutes, by the way!</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23021">The unscrupulous oil baron, the bad guy, and the Seagal character, the good guy, quickly square off and it’s pretty predictable who’s going to come out on top.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23022">It’s easy to see what Seagal and the writer were striving for here; they wanted to portray the Seagal character as the strong, silent type, but because we’re not privy to what he is thinking or feeling, he comes across as a character who only </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23023">reacts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23024"> to the events instigated by the Michael Caine character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23025">That makes him a reactive character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23026">Throughout the film the main character does not once instigate any actions, he only responds to actions initiated by someone else; so all we know about him is that he’s reacting to what’s happening to him and how it affects the tribal community of Eskimos.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23027">His character, portrayed as the strong and silent type, is a man who seemingly knows everything, is right about everything, and lives according to a strict moral code that came out of the early westerns of Tom Mix. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23028">He was so busy being the “good guy,” and reacting to the things the bad guys have done, that he becomes a boring character and literally disappears off the screen.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23029">For example, here’s a situation that is supposed to reveal an aspect of his character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23030">It’s a typical bar fight, and it could have been taken right out of a Tom Mix western. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23031">Seagal’s sitting in the bar, drinking alone at a table. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23032">Three big tough guys, oil riggers, are hassling a drunken Eskimo who wants another drink. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23033">They taunt him, then begin pushing and shoving him around until he collapses into a corner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23034">Seagal doesn’t do anything, he simply stares at them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23035">When they belligerently ask what he’s looking at, Seagal at first does not reply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23036">When they continue taunting him, he stands and the oil rig workers exchange words with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23037">Seagal walks toward them and, before they can continue talking, launches into them, throwing them all over the place, and in only a matter of minutes he reduces the oil workers, and there must be at least ten of them, into whimpering weaklings, begging and groveling for mercy.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23038">Ho-hum. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23039">It’s pretty standard fare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23040">We’ve seen it hundreds of times, for it’s a predictable bar fight: the hero sits alone minding his own business when some tough guys pick on someone who can’t take care of himself, usually a drunk, and the hero steps in and rescues him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23041">What makes this interesting for our purposes is that the Seagal character is so passive, portraying an attitude rather than any emotion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23042">And that’s the way he is during the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23043">We don’t know anything about him, and all we see about this character is a strong, silent, passive attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23044">He becomes the passive active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23045">It’s not very interesting.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23046">The screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader interested enough to keep turning pages, or in this case, keep my fingers off the remote. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23047">The real lesson to be learned in this case is that at no time do we know enough about Seagal to see or understand his thoughts, feelings, or emotions; all he reflects is his attitude. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23048">His humanity, or believability, is all contained inside his head.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23049">That being the case, the only thing this kind of a character can do is react to the situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23050">By placing a character in these types of situations, reacting to something someone else has initiated, the screenwriter causes his main character literally to vanish, to disappear off the page.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23051">In many of Robert Redford’s films he portrays this type of active/reactive character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23052">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23053">Sneakers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23054"> (Larry Lasker and Walter Parkes), </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23055">Indecent Proposal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23056"> (Amy Holden Jones), or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23057">Out of Africa</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23058"> (Kurt Luedtke). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23059">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23060">Sneakers</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23061"> he plays a character who doesn’t show any thoughts or feelings, he simply states that he has a plan and then we see him implementing the plan and then he seems to disappear into the background. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23062">He is a passive yet active character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23063">So if you’re writing, or rewriting, a screenplay, and you sense that your character is washed out, or unseen on the page, or he or she is overshadowed by another character, or the story line seems contrived or predictable, or conflict seems to be missing, the chances are your character is too passive and is busy reacting to other characters or situations rather than creating or initiating the action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23064">One of the “rules” of screenwriting is that action is character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23065">It must be remembered that film is behavior, and what a person does, his or her actions, reveals who he or she is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23066">But there has to be a way for the reader to connect with the character; there must be a character-audience bond established for the script to be effective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23067">If this bond is not formed, then there’s a whole dimension missing in the illumination of character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23068">And when that’s the case, there is no “willing suspension of disbelief.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23069">How do you go about solving the problem of the passive character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23070">First, it has to be approached from the perspective of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23071">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23072">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23073">A lot of writers try to solve the problem by approaching it through </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23074">Structure;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23075"> they seem to feel that if they can add enough action sequences, or tense dramatic moments, that will take care of the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23076">All that does, however, is accentuate the passivity of the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23077">Just like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23078">On Deadly Ground</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23079">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23080">It’s not enough to pile on a number of action sequences, because it doesn’t really solve the problem.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23122">Which brings up another point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23123">Sometimes the screenwriter, wanting to avoid being too direct, or too “on target,” in the dialogue, tries to be a little too subtle, a little too indirect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23124">That creates a sense of confusion and a lack of understanding, so the needs of the character become lost in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23125">what the character is not saying</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23126">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23127">The dialogue seems vague and off center and the reader really doesn’t know what’s going on, and the story line seems to wander off in several directions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23128">It’s a symptom of the screenwriter’s wanting to be too clever.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23129">There are times in a screenplay when the dialogue has to be direct, for exposition purposes, in order to move the story forward, whether on a physical or an emotional level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23130">And sometimes these scenes are the hardest to write just because they are so direct and on the mark. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23131">They’re so easy, you think there’s something wrong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23132">This is where you don’t need subtlety of action or dialogue, you need clarity and definition to keep your character active and interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23133">The great American novelist F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23134">Scott Fitzgerald always felt that the hardest thing a writer has to do is to “write down” to his readers; what he meant by that was that it’s very hard to write material that is too specific and too direct, with no subtlety either in thought, action, or exposition.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23135">This happens all the time if you “try” to make your character alive and interesting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23136">If you think you’re really being smart and clever writing “indirect” dialogue, there’s a good chance the motivation and need of your character will simply wash out and disappear off the page, lost in the twilight zone between clarity and confusion.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23137">That’s when another character will start to take over and become more interesting than the main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23138">If you get the feeling a minor character is dominating or overshadowing the main character, and is more lively and more interesting, it’s a pretty good indication the main character might be too passive, and you’re going to have to strengthen the characterization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23139">It should be noted that there will be moments when your main character will be reacting to another character, action, or situation, and that’s not bad—it’s when reaction becomes his or her only response that it proves a detriment, and that’s why you have to be careful walking the line between action and reaction.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23140">A case in point is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23141">The Accidental Tourist</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23142">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23143">Adapted from the novel by Ann Tyler by screenwriter/director Lawrence Kasdan and Frank Galati, the film, starring William Hurt and Geena Davis, is a quirky comedy about a man who has recently lost his son in a senseless shooting in a mall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23144">William Hurt portrays a writer of travel books for people who detest traveling, and by nature he’s a character who is withdrawn and reclusive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23145">His only companion is his dog, who, it is understood, loves to travel. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23146">They’re quite a pair together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23147">And when the Hurt character accepts a new assignment, he takes his dog to be boarded in a kennel and there meets the delightful and wacky Geena Davis character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23148">And she makes it her “mission” (her dramatic need) to bring him out of his shell because she’s looking to find a father for her own son.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23149">The novel is so unique that it poses major problems adapting it into a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23150">In the first place you have a main character who’s divorced, alone, and reclusive, and the fact that he’s just lost his son in a senseless killing simply compounds the problem; his main action is moping around feeling sorry for himself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23151">This is very delicate material that works wonderfully on the printed page under the gifted talent of Ann Tyler. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23152">But translating this kind of material to the screen is very difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23153">If you want to visually portray a character reacting to the death of another person, you have to know from the beginning that the character’s gaze will be mostly focused inward, that he will be self-absorbed in grief and somewhat reluctant to engage in any kind of action, physical or emotional. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23154">This depends on the story of course, but in the case of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23155">The Accidental Tourist</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23156"> it’s a primary force that’s working on the character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23157">The Hurt character is obsessed with the injustice of life, and withdraws into a comfortable routine of inaction and noninvolvement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23158">This can work part of the time, but since we’re trying to take a passive character and make him active, we have to find a way of incorporating some kind of emotional reaction and making it more visually active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23159">Sometimes, in this situation, you can simply slide over the grief and get the character back on his feet by throwing him into a new situation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23160">For example, one of my students was writing a script, a thriller, and the film opens up with a lovely anniversary dinner between a husband and wife. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23161">When the evening’s over, they decide to exchange cars for the drive home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23162">So the wife drives home in the husband’s car, but as she’s driving, the windows, doors, and sunroof suddenly seal shut, poison gas is released, and she’s killed.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23163">The man’s dramatic need is to pursue and find the killer(s) of his wife and bring them to justice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23164">But he never really accepts the mourning process, so he is constantly moving through the action devoid of any emotional reaction or grief. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23165">You could say that he’s in shock and total denial, and that may be so, but he becomes so obsessed with justice and revenge that he literally becomes a passive character in the midst of nonstop visual action.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23166">This is totally opposite the passive-active character portrayed by William Hurt in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23167">The Accidental Tourist</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23168">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23169">So it really doesn’t matter what kind of story you’re telling, whether an action, adventure, drama, or comedy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23170">That the Hurt character is a writer makes him even more difficult to portray visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23171">And it just didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23172">What happened in the film is exactly what happened in the screenplay: the main character Hurt portrays literally disappears off the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23173">Oh, yes, he’s there physically, but there’s no connection with the audience, and no sympathy for him whatsoever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23174">Which, of course, is part of his character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23175">The Geena Davis character, on the other hand, is striking in her “activity.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23176">She’s always in motion, and livens up the page, and the screen, by her presence, delightfully active in her quest to bring the Hurt character back into life again.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23203">When I was working with the Brazilian filmmaker on the screenplay about the famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos, he was very nervous giving me the screenplay to read, he confided, because it was such an unconventional story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23204">It was a nonlinear screenplay told in a series of flashbacks that traced five different threads of the composer’s life: his boyhood; his search for musical inspiration and direction; his relationships with the two significant women in his life; his life of celebrity and worldwide recognition; and lastly, his final concert and death.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23205">He thought the problems in the screenplay were structural; but what I discovered was that structure wasn’t really the problem; the main character, the composer, was the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23206">Because of the nature of the script, the composer was always reacting to the forces that were shaping his life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23207">That made him a passive character, not an active one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23208">It made the screenplay a simple biography, not a visual experience of the man’s life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23209">That kind of story simply doesn’t work well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23210">No matter that the five different story threads were structured in a jigsaw-puzzle fashion; it didn’t change anything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23211">Throughout the screenplay the main character was constantly reacting to other people, and this created a kind of visual landscape that forced him into the background, and made the secondary characters stronger and more dynamic.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23212">Once I identified the problem, we could approach it from the vantage point of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23213">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23214"> and not </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23215">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23216">, even though it touched both. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23217">So we went back to the foundation of the screenplay in order to make the composer more active. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23218">The composer had </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23219">to create the action</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23220"> that would cause other people to react. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23221">And this had to be set up from the very beginning, so we had to restructure the entire First Act, adding several new scenes in which the composer created the action, and the other characters reacted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23222">Even though this was an unconventional script, it was not difficult to find a way to solve this particular problem once we identified it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23223">Another way to make the character more active is to go back into your scenes and redefine the dramatic need, both in terms of overall story and in the context of each individual scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23224">If you determine the point of view of each character in each scene, then it’s possible to rewrite the scene adding conflict to achieve the maximum dramatic value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23225">Part of the reason a character seems to be passive and reactive is because there’s a lack of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23226">Nine times out of ten if you feel your character is too passive, or is reacting too much to an external situation or character, it’s due to a lack of conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23227">So go back and redefine the internal and external forces working on the character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23228">If it’s an internal, emotional reaction to a situation or event, try to create a visual metaphor and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23229">let us see</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23230"> it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23231">For example, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23232">Dances With Wolves</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23233"> after the John Dunbar character arrives at the fort at Plot Point I, the first thing he does is give himself the task of cleaning up the area; his behavior tells us that he’s cleaning up his life and putting things back in order.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23234">If you find it too difficult, then write a new character biography that will create a new </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23235">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23236">, and in this way you can establish a strong and perceptive point of view that will generate more conflict.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23237">That’s the essence of transforming a character from passive to active.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23285">These are some of the most common questions I encounter regarding the flashback; it really doesn’t matter what country I’m in, or whether the writers are students or professionals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23286">For some reason, the use of flashbacks in a screenplay seems to elicit indecision and insecurity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23287">So, when I’m asked what’s the best way to use a flashback, I listen patiently, then ask why the screenwriter wants to use one in the first place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23288">The person usually becomes very serious and states that the flashback gives information that’s essential to the story.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23289">That’s cool, I respond, but if you use the flashback in this particular situation, does it move the story forward? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23290">Or, does it reveal something about the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23291">Remember, the flashback is simply a tool, a device, which the screenwriter uses to provide the reader with information that he or she cannot incorporate into the screenplay any other way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23292">That’s something most writers don’t understand or take into consideration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23293">That’s why there seems to be so much confusion about whether to use a flashback or not.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23294">The purpose of the flashback is simple: it is a device that </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23295">bridges time and place either to reveal information about the main character, or to move the story forward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23296">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23312">The flashback is a tool; it should be used to give the viewer information about the character or story that he can’t get any other way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23313">It can reveal </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23314">emotional</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23315"> as well as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23316">physical</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23317"> information (as with Andy Dufresne’s breakout from Shawshank), though it often does both, and can show different points of view of the same event, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23318">The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23319"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23320">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23321">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23322">Or it can reveal thoughts, memories, or dreams, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23323">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23324"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23325">Shine</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23326"> (Jan Sardi).</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23370">The script begins with an incident in the Gulf War that takes place at night, in the heat of battle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23371">Colonel Serling makes a decision to fire at a tank that does not respond to his message. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23372">Only after the tank is destroyed, and all men lost, does he learn the tank was one of his own, captained by his friend. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23373">That’s the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23374">inciting incident</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23375"> of the screenplay, the incident or event that catapults the story into motion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23376">When he returns to the States, he’s given the assignment of investigating the woman’s actions, and is forced to look into the mirror of his own soul to examine his own actions under fire, which he cannot forgive or forget.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23377">So we explore the subject of “courage under fire.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23378">As he’s investigating the actions of the Meg Ryan character, he forces himself to seek out the truth, while under constant pressure from the White House and the military. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23379">He finds that for each step he takes, his actions are reflected back at him through his own experience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23380">But it’s the perfect setup for using the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23381">This is the kind of story I call an “emotional detective story,” for each member of the surviving crew sees the action differently. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23382">It’s a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23383">Rashomon-type</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23384"> story, and it’s up to the Denzel Washington character to sort things out and find “the truth.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23385">His search becomes a journey of transformation and self-forgiveness.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23386">It’s true there are two different stories in this screenplay, but both stories reflect the emotional scar that remains unhealed in Colonel Serling’s heart, and his dramatic need is to resolve the conflict within himself.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23387">Two other examples that use the flashback effectively are </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23388">The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23389"> (Shane Black) and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23390">The Usual Suspects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23391">The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23392"> is the story of an amnesia victim (Geena Davis) who has a memory of only “three thousand days,” eight years by her count. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23393">Her name is Samantha, Sam for short, and she has no memory of her past life other than being washed up on the beach in a T-shirt and jeans. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23394">Since that time she has married a nice man, Hal, and has a wonderful eight-year-old daughter, and continuously wonders about her past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23395">As she says in her voice-over in the opening scenes, when she woke up, her daughter was “two months grown in my belly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23396">I don’t know who put her there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23397">I may never. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23398">I just know she’s mine, and she’s about to turn eight.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23399">When the script opens, it is near Christmas Eve and as she’s driving her father-in-law home, she inadvertently hits a deer that kills her father-in-law, and she lands in the hospital. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23400">But something’s wrong, something she can’t explain, and she feels the need for a cigarette, even though she doesn’t smoke. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23401">As she lights up, she sees herself in the hospital mirror and suddenly her reflection becomes alive, drenched in blood, and the reflection says her real name is Charly and she smokes Marlboro Reds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23402">This starts a series of quick-cut flashbacks where she learns more about her identity.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23403">Things start heating up on Christmas Eve when a group of carolers are singing carols in front of the house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23404">Only something’s wrong; the carolers are singing horribly off key. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23405">And when Sam throws open the door to welcome them and offer some Christmas cheer to them, no one is there except a trained killer pointing a shotgun at her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23406">And he calls her Charly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23407">And she reacts, yanking the gun out of his hand, leading to a wild and woolly fight sequence where we learn (as she learns) that she definitely has the ability to take care of herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23408">She ends up killing him, brutally, shocking herself as much as her family. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23409">Plot Point I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23410">She’s really incredible at what she does and she’s astonished that somewhere within her memory banks is this amazing killing machine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23411">It frightens her and she begins her journey of self-discovery to recover her lost life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23412">It’s easy to see how the script is an ideal vehicle for the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23413">Every time Sam finds herself in a certain situation, the screenwriter draws upon a wonderful tool to show us some of the incidents and events of her past life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23414">And it’s not until the Mid-Point that she fully steps into her identity as Charly, and learns (at the same time we learn) that she was an assassin for the CIA. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23415">And they want her dead because she “knows too much.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23416">She is truly a lethal weapon—so lethal, in fact, that she wonders, as we do, how she could have lived so contentedly as a wife and mother with this killing machine inside her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23417">And this is what she’s trying to resolve.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23418">We’re not talking about the quality of writing here, or how good or bad the film is, we’re simply talking about creating the cinematic </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23419">context</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23420"> of taking a particular situation and effectively incorporating flashbacks into the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23421">All the flashbacks used are points of present time, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23422">“flashpresent.”</span></i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23423">Which is illustrated very clearly in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23424">The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23425">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23426">What makes the screenplay so unique is that we’re examining one particular event, an explosion on board a ship in the San Pedro harbor that kills some twenty-seven men over a reported $91 million in cocaine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23427">This event is seen through a series of voice-over flashbacks narrated by “Verbal” Kint (Kevin Spacey), a palsied con artist with a twisted foot and a penchant for talking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23428">Verbal is one of two survivors of the blast (the other is an aged Hungarian gangster), and under the relentless questioning of the customs agent played by Chazz Palminteri, Verbal tells the story of “what happened.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23429">The context of the script is tailored to become the perfect vehicle to show the events leading up to the shipboard blast, the inciting incident that opens the film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23430">There is no linear story-line progression here, meaning we don’t go through the story from beginning to end, chronologically, but the flashbacks reveal what happened in visual bits and pieces.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23431">As Verbal is being questioned, he tells us, in voice-over, how the five suspects were picked up, placed in the same holding cell, and questioned about the hijacking of a truckload of gun parts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23432">And as Verbal answers the policeman’s questions, we start fitting the individual pieces of the visual jigsaw puzzle together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23433">These questions work as </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23434">lead-ins</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23435"> to the individual flashback sequences and, again, should be thought of as a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23436">“flashpresent”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23437"> because Verbal is literally making the story up as he goes along. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23438">It’s a bold cinematic demonstration of taking a singular incident, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23439">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23440">, and presenting it in a nonlinear fashion.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23441">Which brings us back to the question of when to use a flashback, and when not to, and how to solve a problem with it, either by incorporating it into the story line or by removing it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23442">There are no “rules,” of course, about this; it really depends upon whether you’ve designed the flashback to be an integral part of the story, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23443">Courage Under Fire, The Usual Suspects, The Long Kiss Goodnight, How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23444">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23445">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23446">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23447">If your screenplay was not conceived to incorporate flashbacks and still doesn’t seem to be working, see whether “the problem” exhibits some of the symptoms listed on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23448">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23449">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23450">If the answer is yes, and you think a flashback may solve the problem, whatever it is, then the simple rule If you can say it, don’t show it, may apply.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23451">Now, I’m sure this sounds like a contradiction, because the object of a screenplay is to tell the story in pictures, not words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23452">The dialogue only becomes an adjunct to the visual information that moves the story forward; either that, or it reveals information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23453">Suppose, for example, you want to show an event that has affected your character, and you decide to incorporate it into the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23454">So you go through the scene and find a place to lead into the flashback, which naturally results in your cutting away from the middle of the scene to insert the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23455">What happens? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23456">In the case of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23457">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23458"> it works wonderfully, because the patient is a mystery, and slowly we begin to learn who he is, and his affair with Katherine, but each time we cut away there is a natural and solid transition point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23459">Plus, the entire love affair, though told in flashback, is really the structural foundation of the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23460">We learn what happened to the English patient at the same time Hana (Juliet Binoche) does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23461">It works wonderfully.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23462">By the same token there’s also a good chance that you might destroy the integrity of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23463">And that, of course, is not the point of the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23464">If you cut away in the middle of a scene, it could also create another problem instead. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23465">Why?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23466">Take a look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23467">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23468">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23469">When Clarice Starling visits Hannibal Lecter in his makeshift prison cell after he’s been transferred to Memphis, she wants to obtain the name of the serial killer Buffalo Bill. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23470">And she knows that Lecter knows the identity of the killer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23471">She wants that name, but they don’t have much time before she’ll be forced to leave. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23472">His reply is that “we don’t measure time in the same way, do we, Clarice?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23473">and then he insists that she tell him more about her childhood after the death of her father. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23474">Knowing the guards will return any moment (which creates a tremendous tension in the scene), she proceeds to tell him that she was sent to live with her uncle in Montana. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23475">One night, she tells Lecter, she woke up hearing “screams,” and when she sneaks out of bed to investigate, she finds men slaughtering the spring lambs in the barn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23476">Horrified, she tries to save one of the lambs, but can only carry it about a mile before she’s caught and returned to the ranch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23477">Her uncle is furious, and, in retaliation he sends her away to an orphanage, and that’s where she spends the rest of her childhood growing up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23478">It’s a powerful scene, and especially significant since the title of the book and screenplay was taken from it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23479">The scene was originally conceived as a flashback with the dialogue in present time playing over the images of Clarice as a little girl. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23480">But when Jonathan Demme filmed it, he saw the emotional dynamic of the scene between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster was so intense that if he cut away to show the child discovering the slaughtering of the spring lambs, he would absolutely destroy the integrity of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23481">As mentioned, this is one of the most important scenes in the film because it is the final flashback that shows her confronting the events of her past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23482">Without completing this incident in her childhood, Clarice would have been incomplete in her growth, both as a person and FBI agent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23483">Which is a major part of her character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23484">On film the scene was so strong that the director couldn’t cut away and incorporate the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23485">The price would have been too high had he chosen to use it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23486">He would have lost the emotional integrity of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23487">So he decided to keep the action in present time to maintain that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23488">And, if you remember, the entire scene is played in close shot and it’s so powerful that it remains firmly fixed in the memory. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23489">The information revealed about the character was more revealing and more dramatic stated in dialogue than it would have been in flashback.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23490">This is not a hard-and-fast “rule,” but it is something to remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23491">So </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23492">if you can say it, don’t show it</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23493">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23494">You can use flashbacks for any number of reasons but their primary purpose is to bridge time and place; to reveal a past emotional event or physical conflict that still affects the character, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23495">The English Patient;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23496"> or to move the story forward, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23497">Courage Under Fire;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23498"> and to give insight into, and understanding of, a character’s behavior, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23499">How to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23500">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23501">Or to solve a mystery of the past, as in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23502">Lone Star</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23503">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23533">The next morning Andy is missing from cell count. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23534">No one knows where or how he disappeared, and it drives the warden crazy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23535">As the warden questions Red and the guards, he throws one of the rocks Andy left behind at the large poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23536">But a strange thing happens; the rock goes right through the paper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23537">Everybody stops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23538">The warden moves toward the poster, pokes his finger through the hole, then shoves his entire arm through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23539">He yanks the poster off the wall and we discover (as the characters discover) that a tunnel has been hollowed out of the wall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23540">We cut to a montage of several police cars racing down the highway, and guards combing the countryside, and all they find is part of Andy’s torn shirt and his loyal rock hammer, which has been worn down to the nub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23541">That’s the flashpoint by which we lead into the flashback and Red tells us, in voice-over, how Andy got out of Shawshank Prison.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23542">We see a couple of scenes of Andy picking at the wall with his rock hammer to carve his name when a chunk of rock falls out; then we see him in the movie requesting the Rita Hayworth poster; then shots of Andy digging into the tunnel at night, and emptying the gravel from the tunnel into the prison yard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23543">Then we flashback again and see Andy’s last night as he polishes the warden’s shoes, only this time we see it from Andy’s point of view; we see him substituting the false ledger for the warden’s, and he puts the false one into the safe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23544">Then we see him walking back into the cell block, only this time we see the shoes he is wearing; bright and shiny. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23545">In Andy’s cell we see him taking off his prison garb, revealing the warden’s shirt and tie underneath, then he places his goods into the plastic bag and starts his escape to freedom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23546">Red tells us in voice-over that “Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I can’t even imagine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23547">Or maybe I just don’t want to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23548">Five hundred yards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23549">The length of five football fields. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23550">Just shy of half a mile.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23551">This is just a wonderful flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23552">Structured in a nonlinear way, it moves the story forward and reveals a part of his character that we never knew existed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23553">Not once during the entire Second Act did he ever mention that he was considering escape. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23554">But if you think about it, that is his character’s dramatic need; to get out of prison must be the dramatic need of every convict doing time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23555">We don’t need to state it, but the screenwriter must know it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23556">Andy’s escape is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23557">physical</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23558"> use of the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23559">It shows us how he escaped. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23560">But there’s also an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23561">emotional</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23562"> use of the flashback. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23563">In How </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23564">to Make an American Quilt</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23565"> there are six different stories that deal with various aspects of love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23566">The subject of the quilt, “Where Love Resides” is what the story is about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23567">The screenplay itself is structured very much like a quilt; piece by piece, story by story, certain situations in life and love are shown that allow Finn to ferret out what she needs to learn so as to let go of her fear of commitment.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23568">What works so well is the lead-in point where the flashback dovetails into present time, and it’s this weaving of narrative story line between past and present that illuminates Finn’s dilemma so well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23569">Each piece of the quilt the women are making gives us some insight and understanding into the nature of love.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23570">Using flashbacks in this manner offers a unique perspective on the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23571">Before she can deal with the commitment of marriage, Finn must learn to confront her own emotional fear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23572">This is shown in two ways: one, through the dissertation she’s now working on (her third, she explains); we see her past history is constant as we learn, that when her thesis is almost complete, she decides that’s not the subject she really wants, and so begins another thesis on another subject. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23573">I think we’re all like Finn in a way, because most of us have struggled with the fears and insecurities of an emotional commitment at some point in our lives.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23574">The first thing we learn about Finn is that her fear of commitment has been passed down to her from her mother. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23575">“Maybe she was just afraid that their relationship had become just like everyone else’s,” she confides, and that’s why her parents separated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23576">So, when Sam proposes to Finn, she, caught in this emotional turmoil, runs away to the safety of her grandmother’s house.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23577">As mentioned, each of the quilters’ particular stories reflects a certain emotional aspect in relationship to love and commitment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23578">There is something Finn must learn from all the stories so she can resolve the conflict of “where love resides” within herself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23579">This is a very good example of the way flashback reveals the emotional conflict that resides at the core of Finn’s character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23580">Which brings us back to the basic question of this chapter: When can you use a flashback to solve a particular problem?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23581">The examples given illustrate the basic context of the flashback; either physical or emotional, it is the point at which you slide into the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23582">“flashpresent.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23583"> If you feel you have a problem the flashback creates or can solve, what do you perceive the problem to be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23584">First, ask yourself what you want to use the flashback for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23585">Is it to reveal character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23586">Or is it to show </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23587">how</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23588"> an event reveals the character, in terms of their actions and reactions? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23589">What incident are you going to show, and what does it reveal about the character, and how is it going to move the story forward?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23590">If, for example, you have a situation where you think your story is wandering around in circles, or your character is too talky and explains too many things, you might consider using a flashback to reveal a certain aspect of your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23591">If your character is too passive and reactive, or feels too thin or one-dimensional, you could use a flashback to provide more depth and dimension to your story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23592">But—and it’s a very big </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23593">but</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23594">—you just can’t insert a flashback because you think it will work to expand character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23595">You need to go back into the character and define those forces that are working on him or her during the screenplay; if need be, write essays about the relationships between the characters just to clarify them in your own mind.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23596">“What is character but the determination of incident? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23597">And what is incident but the illumination of character?”</span></i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23598">These are questions you must ask yourself as you start contemplating the use of flashback to solve a particular problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23599">If you decide to use it, think of it in terms of a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23600">“flashpresent”;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23601"> what is your character thinking or feeling in the present moment? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23602">If you can get into your character’s head, and find some thought, memory, or event that reflects, or acts, upon the present moment, and, through it, show how it affects your character, you gain an optimal advantage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23603">Go into your character’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23604">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23605"> (</span><a href="#calibre_link-79" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23606">Chapter 13</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23607">) and see what you can find.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23608">The best use of the flashback is to provide some kind of emotional insight and understanding for your character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23609">The transformation between Sam and Charly in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23610">The Long Kiss Goodnight</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23611"> is all about regaining a side of her character that’s been buried for the last eight years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23612">That’s why I always think of a flashback as a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23613">“flashpresent.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23614"> It’s what’s inside your character’s head at the present moment; it either moves the story forward or reveals information about the main character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23615">Could you have used a flashback in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23616">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23617"> to show her </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23618">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23619">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23620">Possibly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23621">There might have been an opportunity to show what happened to Louise when she was raped in Texas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23622">It might have helped clarify why she killed Harlan in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23623">But would it have been as effective? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23624">Not really. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23625">There’s no sense spoon-feeding the reader or audience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23626">We’ve become too sophisticated in terms of movie culture to do that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23627">As far as I’m concerned, a flashback revealing this event in Louise’s life would have been redundant and surely not be as effective as the way Callie Khouri originally conceived it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23628">So be careful when you use a flashback.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23629">Some films incorporate the flashback as a major part of the story; they use it to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23630">“bookend”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23631"> their main story line, meaning they open the script with an incident or event, and then flashback to the actual story, then end it in present time again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23632">A few films that do this well are: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23633">The Bridges of Madison County, Sunset Boulevard, Annie Hall</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23634">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23635">Citizen Kane</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23636">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23637">And, of course, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23638">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23639">.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23640">Should you decide to use a flashback, make sure it doesn’t intrude upon the flow of the action, or get in the way of the story, or draw too much attention to itself.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23641">If you can say it, maybe you don’t have to show it after all.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23692">When you read and analyze a good screenplay it’s like seeing bits and pieces of film joined together to create a series of moving images, the story told in pictures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23693">A clock ticking, a car moving slowly down a crowded city street, a woman peering out a window, the sound of a baby crying or a dog barking, the car pulling into a parking space, all these bits and pieces of little pictures can be joined together to create a tense and suspense-filled sequence that has the reader, or audience, on the edge of their collective seats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23694">That’s what film is all about, building, or putting together, these little bits and pieces of images that are joined together to create an organic story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23695">Remember the definition of a screenplay: “a story told with pictures, in dialogue and description, and placed within the context of dramatic structure.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23696">When we approach the dynamics of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23697">Problem Solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23698"> in screenwriting, all the solutions, to whatever the problem, will utilize </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23699">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23700">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23701">That’s because when you fix, or correct, a particular problem, you have to reconstruct, or rebuild, the elements, or content, that make up the narrative line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23702">A story is a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23703">whole</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23704"> made up of specific </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23705">parts:</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23706"> the action, the characters, the locations, sets, scenes, sequences, Acts, Plot Points, music, effects, and so on, all these </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23707">parts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23708"> go into the craft of building and putting together a story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23709">It’s the understanding of this relationship between the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23710">parts</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23711"> that make up the story, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23712">whole</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23713">, which allows you to approach Problem Solving from the confidence and security that you know what you’re doing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23714">Yes, structure </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23715">is</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23716"> the foundation of screenwriting, and it’s also an essential part of the problem-solving process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23717">If you have a scene that doesn’t play well, for whatever reason, and you define it as a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23718">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23719">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23720">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23721">, you’re going to have to go back and create new incidents, episodes, or events to blend into the material, and that’s going to create a new mix. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23722">Anything you add is going to have to be restructured and rebuilt; as Newton’s Third Law of Motion states, “For every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23723">For every cause there is an effect, and if you’ve not fleshed out a particular scene to the necessary degree, you’re going to have to go back into that material and change a few things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23724">And whatever you change, you’re going to have to restructure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23725">It’s as simple as that.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23726">So what kind of problems are you dealing with within the context of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23727">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23728">?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23729">First, you have the context of story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23730">Is your story focused, clear, and precise, or does it seem to wander around trying to find its line of action? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23731">Even the most complicated script, like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23732">The Usual Suspects</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23733">, is clear and concise, at least from the writer’s point of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23734">Does your story seem to skirt on the edge of things and not go deeply enough in terms of action and character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23735">Does it appear that your scenes have no dramatic payoff? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23736">Do your characters seem to be wandering around searching for their dramatic need?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23737">All these are symptoms of something that’s not quite right with your structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23738">It could be the scenes are too short, or not paid off, or the story line seems to wander around with no sense of development, which, remember, is defined as “a line of direction.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23739">In short, with a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23740">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23741">, something seems to be missing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23742">I believe that good structure in a screenplay should not be seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23743">Good structure should simply disappear into the content of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23744">When I first started developing my concepts of structure, I would go to a movie, watch and notebook in hand, and dutifully time the individual Plot Points, because I wanted to clarify and define screenplay form. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23745">Form, not formula. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23746">Looking back on it now, I see I was trying to locate and define the building blocks of the screenplay, and what I discovered was that structure was like the DNA of screenwriting.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23747">When I read a screenplay now, or see a film, I really don’t pay too much attention to structure; I just let the material wash over me. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23748">If the script or film doesn’t feel right, if there seems to be some kind of problem, then I’ll go into the material and analyze it structurally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23749">I can recognize structure by the particular beats in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23750">I’ve always maintained that the screenwriter’s job is to keep the reader turning pages, so if I find myself becoming bogged down in the reading experience, that’s a signal there may be something wrong structurally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23751">If I can’t follow the story line, if it wanders around, or something seems to be missing, or if too much is happening, or there are too many characters, or nothing seems to be paid off, that’s a symptom that something’s wrong; that’s when I’ll start breaking it down into its component parts.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23752">Good structure alone does not make a good screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23753">That’s simply a fact of life that everyone has to remember. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23754">So many times people will tell me they’ve written a screenplay “just the way you say it should be done,” and immediately I get suspicious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23755">By the same token the opposite is also true: you can’t have a good screenplay without good structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23756">Structure is only the foundation, the start point, not the be-all and end-all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23757">Characters, action, dynamic visuals, and strong situations are only some of the things that make up a good screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23758">So many times people ask me for examples of movies that don’t have a good structure and I really can’t give too many examples. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23759">That’s because a film without good structure doesn’t hold up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23760">It wanders, is slow to develop, and the only thing that can save it is the dimension of its characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23761">The audience perceives this, so the film only has a run of a few weeks and then disappears deep into the bowels of the film graveyard.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23762">The definition of structure, remember, is </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23763">to build</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23764">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23765">to put something together</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23766">, and as so often happens, when you correct one problem in a screenplay it always affects something else, so you have to add elements, or remove elements, to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23767">That means building, or putting together, a new scene or sequence.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23768">So what we’ll try to do in this section is uncover various problems that exist as a result of structure, and which can be solved by restructuring the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23769">And, at the risk of repeating myself again, no matter what the problem, you’re going to have to restructure the material, whether it’s a problem of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23770">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23771">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23772">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23773">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23774">In the arena of Problem Solving, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23775">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23776"> is an integral part of every solution.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23777">One of the problems I’ve become aware of in my teaching experience is that writers will sometimes write key scenes, either action or dialogue, which are not paid off; the scenes usually end too early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23778">In a dramatic scene, for example, the screenwriter will cut to the next scene before the purpose of that particular scene is realized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23779">And then, when I’m reading the material, I get the feeling something’s missing; the action feels incomplete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23780">It’s so important—essential—to determine the purpose of the scene in order to dramatically realize the intention of that scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23781">A few years ago I was commissioned to read and analyze a screenplay for a producer/writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23782">It was an action-thriller set in the Cayman Islands, a marvelous location for this kind of film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23783">The story, about a photographer who accidentally stumbles into a situation where he becomes a target for murder, was interesting and well written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23784">There were good action sequences and the script was well structured.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23785">But as I was reading the screenplay, I kept getting lost in the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23786">I was confused and so many characters were pulled into the narrative line, I didn’t know who the main character was and what the whole thing was about.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23787">Even though the premise was good, with solid visuals and locations, good action sequences, and interesting characters, somehow I got the feeling that something was missing, something just wasn’t right. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23788">I couldn’t pinpoint the problem, so I started examining it more closely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23789">As I read through the screenplay again, I saw that many of the key scenes were not complete, that the action had stopped before the dramatic requirements of the scenes had been satisfied. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23790">In the middle of a confrontation scene, for example, the writer would cut away to another scene, or to another character, and this altered the focus of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23791">I had the impression that something was definitely missing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23792">With that in mind, I went back and looked at the material again, and saw that this particular trait had become a tendency on the part of the writer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23793">In scene after scene, a scene or situation would be set up, and then before the purpose of the scene was realized, he left the scene; the scene was not really paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23794">So while the idea of the scene had been planted, it had never come to fruition, and therefore the action and story line seemed hazy and uncertain.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23795">Now, I had been aware of this phenomenon before, but I never had a name for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23796">But this was such a clear example of the problem that I labeled it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23797">Sceneus Interruptus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23798">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23799">Leaving the scene too early simply means the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23800">purpose of the scene is unsatisfied, unfulfilled</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23801">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23802">It does not accomplish its dramatic function and therefore leaves a gaping hole in the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23803">And when that happens, something is definitely missing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23804">This particular problem could be approached from either </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23805">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23806"> or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23807">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23808">, of course, but I chose to put it under the heading of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23809">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23810"> because if you leave the scene too early, you’ve got to add components back into the material in order to reconstruct the unit of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23811">That’s how you build tension and pacing, by going into the elements of the material and finding ways of expanding it visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23812">That’s why when you see a shot of a key being placed in a lock, or thread being stitched into a piece of fabric, or a bullet placed into the chamber of a gun, it expands the visual tension of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23813">That’s why film is such an art form where time can be stretched or condensed and becomes larger than life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23814">Pacing is always related to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23815">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23816">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23817">If there aren’t enough elements in the scene to hold it together, the chances are it will bog down and not go anywhere. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23818">The tension will be dissipated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23819">Conversely, if you have too many elements in the scene, the pacing will also be off, and the material will have a slow, wandering feel to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23820">Again, no tension.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23821">In the particular screenplay I had been asked to read, there is a series of short scenes that I’m going to use as an example to illustrate what I’m talking about in terms of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23822">Sceneus Interruptus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23823">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23824">Now I know the material I’m using is totally out of context, and therefore may not be as illustrative as I would like it to be. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23825">But I’m going to take a shot at it anyway.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23871">Now, at first glance it may appear that nothing is really “wrong” here, that whatever problem there is might be fixed by simply adding some dialogue or opening up the scenes visually. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23872">But if you take the context of the story line into account, you’ll see there’s really no narrative thread. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23873">The writer cuts away from the scene before the purpose of the scene is established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23874">And that’s what made me so uncomfortable reading it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23875">This little scene where Gary confronts Helo is way too thin, and really doesn’t say anything that will move the story forward or reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23876">Granted, the whole section is taken out of context, but it’s pretty clear that more has to be added, not only from the story line’s point of view, but also from the character’s perspective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23877">Helo is Gary’s first link to the crime, so we must see these two men warily circling each other before they confront each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23878">As you can see, the writer cuts away from every scene before anything significant happens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23879">Because the purpose of the scene has not been satisfied (establishing a link between Helo and the crime), cutting away too soon simply dissipates the action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23880">Whatever tension there might have been has simply vanished.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23881">The result of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23882">Sceneus Interruptus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23883"> can lead to serious problems in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23884">Once the tendency of cutting away before the purpose is established, chances are it’s going to be reflected in a variety of scenes, and that means it’s going to influence the entire story line.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23885">That’s what happens here in this short section. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23886">The action seems disjointed and listless, the natural transitions are forced and contrived, and the action moves along like a car with a flat tire. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23887">For the reader, concentration is lost, the interest in the story line wanes, and the script is usually shelved before it’s been completely read.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23888">I think the most difficult thing about this problem is simply recognizing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23889">So many times we read and reread the material looking for ways to improve it, and we have a hard time seeing that a scene ends too early.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23890">Once you become aware that the problem exists, you can fix it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23891">And the way to do that is to break every scene down and restructure it into a beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23892">First, what’s the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23893">What’s it doing there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23894">What does the character want to win, gain, get, or achieve during the course of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23895">In what way does this scene relate to the character’s dramatic need in the screenplay? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23896">Where has the character come from, and where is he/she going after the scene is finished? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23897">These questions must be addressed and resolved before the scene begins.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23898">If you don’t know what’s going on during the scene, who does? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23899">That means knowing what the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of your character are, and keeping them clearly in mind as the scene plays out.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23900">How do you know when you’ve satisfied the requirements of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23901">There’s no real way of knowing that, of course, except that each scene becomes a link in the chain of dramatic action. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23902">Each scene, as mentioned, is like a living cell; it should contain everything within it, either to move the story forward or to reveal information about the character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23903">Just like the DNA molecule in living cells. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23904">Every scene serves a particular function, and it’s up to you, the screenwriter, to know or determine what that function is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23905">What is its purpose? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23906">If you don’t know what it is, or what it does, or why it’s there, you’ll probably have to drop it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23907">Just cut it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23908">The chances are it doesn’t belong in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23909">You have to be ruthless when you’re writing a screenplay, especially when you’re trying to solve a problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23910">Screenwriters all over the world have the same complaint; they always have to cut what they think are their best scenes, their best writing, out of the scripts.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23911">To solve the problems of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23912">Sceneus Interruptus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23913">, start by rethinking the parameters of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23914">What are the character’s thoughts, feelings, or emotions when the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23915">Where is he or she coming from, and what is the emotional reality working on the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23916">Does your character have a sore throat and does he seem to be cold? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23917">Has he/she just managed to escape from a would-be attacker? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23918">Is he/she preparing for a big showdown, or confrontation scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23919">So, define the emotional forces working on your character when the scene begins.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23920">The next step is to find out what elements you have to work with within the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23921">Where does it take place? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23922">What time of the day or night? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23923">Is there anything within the setting of the scene that you can use to your advantage, dramatically? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23924">The weather, a crowded art gallery, a crowded restaurant, a market, or on the street? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23925">Or is it late at night, where the silence and emptiness of the location seem to create their own ambience? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23926">Once you establish the environmental elements, you can break the scene down into beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23927">On a separate piece of paper, break down the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23928">To start, where does your character come from before the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23929">Write it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23930">If the scene takes place in a library, for example, your character may have come from the office, or maybe an exercise class; if the latter, then it means that he will have to dress, leave the area, walk to the subway or car, ride or drive to the destination, park, get out, walk up the steps, and enter the lobby. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23931">That’s the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23932">And remember conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23933">Maybe something happens on the way to the scene that affects the character, so you might want to create a little back story to the scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23934">Then, find a way to dramatize the purpose of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23935">Why is the character at the library? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23936">To find a certain book, do some research on the Internet, or have a clandestine meeting?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23937">Isolate the flow of events that make up the middle of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23938">The character arrives, walks into the lobby, searches for someone or something, then finds the person or book he or she is looking for, finds a corner table to sit down at, and then the purpose of the scene begins to unfold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23939">What’s the nature of the dialogue? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23940">Is it direct, for exposition, so the story can move forward? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23941">Or is there a subtext to the dialogue, a hidden meaning, or an indirect threat? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23942">Is this a scene that reveals something about the character, that gives us some insight into the emotional or physical landscape of the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23943">It doesn’t have to be much. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23944">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23945">Courage Under Fire</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23946"> we can tell what Colonel Serling is thinking or feeling when he pulls out a bottle of Scotch and takes a long pull. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23947">We don’t need any more explanation than that.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23948">Then, the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23949">The character(s) get up, leave the library, and then where do they go or what do they do? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23950">Do you follow the main character, or the other person? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23951">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23952">Pulp Fiction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23953"> the interesting thing about the bar scene in the beginning where Vinnie (Travolta) meets Butch (Willis) is that we could have followed the Butch character just as easily we do Vinnie on his “date” with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23954">This is all creative choice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23955">Does anything happen on the way to the next scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23956">How much time elapses between the scene in the library and the next scene?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23957">Look it over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23958">Have you satisfied the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23959">That is, does it contain the correct information, either visually, or emotionally, or physically, or through the dialogue, to be complete within itself, or to act as a link to another scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23960">As we’ll see in </span><a href="#calibre_link-86" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23961">Chapter 19</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23962">, it’s always better to enter the scene late and get out early, but the only way you can really do that is if you are totally clear on what each beat or movement is, within the body of the scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23963">Is there enough conflict within the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23964">Are the characters’ points of view clear, concentrated, and focused? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23965">That’s something you have to be clear about yourself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23966">That’s your homework, and nobody can do it but you.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23967">If you’re not clear about the relationship between the main character and the person he or she is meeting in the library, then write a short, free-association essay of two or three pages about their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23968">When did they first meet, and where? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23969">What happened? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23970">What you’re really trying to do is to get enough information so you can make sure your scene works and is totally effective for the purpose it serves in the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23971">When you complete the necessary preparation, then do your breakdown of beginning, middle, and end, and then select bits and pieces from each category to set up and then pay off the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23972">For example, we could start with a shot of the office clock, followed by a shot of the character looking and thinking, then cut to him or her riding in the subway, or driving, then entering the lobby of the library, searching for the other character, their meeting, and then pay it off with a shot of the character leaving, and walking down the steps, or simply go into a transition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23973">Clean, lean, and tight.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-23974">In this way you know that the purpose of the scene is satisfied, complete unto itself, providing as well a necessary link in the chain of dramatic action, so the story can move forward with concise skill and visual continuity.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24031">This little scene, more like a mention, doesn’t seem like much at the time, just part of her ditzy character, like eating a frozen candy bar for breakfast one bite at a time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24032">Later, when Thelma and Louise are driving toward their anticipated weekend, Thelma hands the gun to Louise, saying, “You take care of this.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24033">Louise is shocked: “What in the hell did you bring that for?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24034">“Oh, you know…” Thelma replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24035">“In case there’s any crazy psycho killers on the loose,” and they both laugh at her outrageous behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24036">Louise tells her to “put it in my purse.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24037">In reality, this little bit seems like a “throwaway,” something to shed light on the character, nothing that’s really too important. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24038">It’s only later, when Harlan is in the parking lot, forcing himself on Thelma, that the gun comes into play. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24039">Louise takes it out of her purse, orders him to stop, which he does reluctantly, and when he exchanges words with her, she loses it and blows him away.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24040">This gun is integral to the plot of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24041">If Thelma had not taken the gun with her, had not given it to Louise, Harlan would not have been killed, they would not become fugitives from the law, and the whole story wouldn’t have happened; in short, if there were no gun there wouldn’t have been any </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24042">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24043">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24054">Different things must be set up, then incorporated into the story line—that’s one of the principal rules of all writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24055">One of the most important elements is setting up the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24056">dramatic premise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24057"> of the screenplay; that is, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24058">what the story is about</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24059">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24060">The Set-Up also refers to setting up the first ten pages of the screenplay, establishing the inciting incident, as well as providing enough exposition to move the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24061">Setting up these elements gives texture and direction, the natural line of development, to the narrative.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24062">Characters also have to be set up, along with their characteristics and manners of behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24063">Character aspects serve a variety of dramatic functions, like Louise knowing how to handle a gun. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24064">What happened to her in Texas when she was growing up, the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24065">Circle of Being</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24066">, is a character element that is essential to know. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24067">As mentioned earlier, it was Louise, the young girl raped in Texas, who really pulled the trigger, not the Louise of the present.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24068">If certain elements of character are set up, then they have to be paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24069">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24070">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24071">, Andy Dufresne had been a respectable banker in a Portland, Maine, bank, before being convicted of his wife’s murder, so he knows enough about the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24072">system</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24073"> to create a fictitious identity, to establish a phony driver’s license, birth certificate, and passport as well as duplicate a set of account books. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24074">So we believe he could take the warden’s money—which he has laundered and deposited in banks all over the Portland, Maine, area—to Mexico. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24075">“On the outside,” he says to Red, “I was an honest man. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24076">I had to come to prison to learn how to be a crook.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24077">And that information, which had been set up early in the screenplay, was not finally paid off until the end of the Second Act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24078">So it really doesn’t matter where the story point is paid off, as long as it’s set up properly, whether it’s related to the character or the plot.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24079">There are other elements that need to be set up in a screenplay, specific objects, for example, like the gun in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24080">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24081">, or the rock hammer in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24082">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24083">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24084">These particular objects are essential to the story line, so they need to be planted in the screenplay at different points within the landscape of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24085">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24086">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24087"> we have seen the warden giving Andy clothes to take to the prison laundry, and shoes to shine, so when he gives Andy his clothes and shoes on the night he makes his escape, it’s totally believable, meaning it’s paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24088">The “willing suspension of disbelief” has been set up and we buy it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24089">It’s good writing.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24095">When I began experimenting with the screenplay form, I understood I had to learn it, literally, from the ground up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24096">Which meant I had to teach myself how to write a screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24097">There were no books or anything about it, and the only thing I had at my disposal was Lajos Egri’s great book </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24098">The Art of Dramatic Writing</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24099">, written in the forties about the craft of playwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24100">So I did the only thing I could do: I got hold of some screenplays from the two filmmakers I admired the most and started reading and rereading the material.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24125">The other filmmaker I studied was the magnificent, revolutionary, and influential Michelangelo Antonioni. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24126">The Italian director is a master of setting up and weaving emotional attitudes and characterizations throughout his films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24127">I was so impressed and inspired when I saw </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24128">La Notte (The Night)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24129">, that I literally began my writing career with it, and thus entered the world of contemporary film. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24130">La Notte</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24131"> is masterful study about the relationship and values of a well-to-do Italian couple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24132">The way Antonioni sets up his characters, his mastery of the situation, the visual expressions of behavior, were revolutionary in terms of film, and when you see any of his films today, they stand firmly on the timeless pedestal of great film art. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24133">During the last few years I’ve had the privilege of getting to know Antonioni (he’s the only director I address as Maestro), and I’m as much in awe of him today as I ever was. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24134">The way he sets up an emotional situation in just a few visual strokes is phenomenal.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24135">These filmmakers taught me everything. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24136">And, as mentioned, I was so struck with Peckinpah’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24137">Ride the High Country</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24138"> that I decided that this was what great screenwriting was all about. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24139">So when I managed to get hold of the script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24140">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24141"> (written by Peckinpah with Oscar Saul), I think I must have read it at least a hundred times, analyzing it, taking it apart, memorizing it scene by scene, action by action, character by character, trying to understand what made it tick and what made it work so successfully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24142">It was a wonderful education.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24143">The script, like so many of Peckinpah’s films, was a Western (he loved the theme of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24144">“unchanged men in a changing time,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24145"> which he incorporated in almost every film he did), and takes place right after the Civil War. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24146">The story concerns an obsessed renegade Union officer, Charlton Heston, who refuses to accept the peace between the North and South even though the war is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24147">A major in the Confederate army, he fled to Mexico rather than accept the peace treaty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24148">He’s determined to fight his own war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24149">In this case he breaks a group of misfits out of prison and together they hunt the band of Apaches responsible for the slaughter that opens the screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24150">The script opens at a ranch on the frontier on Halloween. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24151">The men, women, and children are preparing for the large celebration and it’s a joyous and festive time, with the children playing “cowboys and Indians” in makeshift holiday masks and warpaint, as the grown-ups dance and enjoy themselves getting ready for the evening’s feast.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24152">But as the children play their games, we suddenly start cross-cutting between the costumed children and a band of renegade Apaches creeping toward the ranch house in what will eventually turn into a bloody massacre. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24153">The fierceness of their faces, emblazoned in war paint, contrasted with the children’s decorated faces, and surrounded with the festive music of the fiddles playing and the people dancing, is as visually striking as it is terrifying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24154">When the massacre begins, the laughs and squeals of the children are interwoven with the war cries of the attacking Apaches, resulting in a truly memorable sequence.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24155">The opening is a remarkable example of the power and magic of film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24156">(Unfortunately, because of budgetary problems, the studio brutally recut the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24157">Peckinpah wanted to take his name off it, but the studio prevailed.) It is this particular incident, the inciting incident, that sets up the entire film, and the story line is a reaction to this event, tracing the obsession of the renegade Union officer, Major Dundee (Heston), who relentlessly tracks down the Apaches, hoping to avenge the massacre of the homesteaders.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24158">The script of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24159">Major Dundee</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24160"> is a wonderful illustration of how to set up the dramatic premise of the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24161">Sometimes, going back over the material you’ve written, you may find a scene or a sequence that seems unclear, or maybe you think the dialogue needs to be sharpened, or another scene added to clarify the narrative or define the character, and many times the problem can be solved by making sure that certain story elements have been set up appropriately. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24162">Setting up necessary story elements, then paying them off, allows you to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24163">No moments are too small or too subtle to be set up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24164">If these points are not set up appropriately, the reader will sometimes shift his or her focus away from the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24165">And this, of course, results in a “problem.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24166">There are a several good examples of how you set things up in order to pay them off later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24167">If you do want to set something up, think of it as a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24168">“noun”;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24169"> you’re going to be setting up a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24170">“person, place, or thing,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24171"> either a character, or a situation, or an object. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24172">As mentioned, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24173">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24174"> is a great example: the gun Thelma puts into her purse at the beginning of the film is paid off at Plot Point I when Harlan is shot in the parking lot. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24175">In that case it was setting up an object, or “thing.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24176">Setting up her character, in order to expand the situation, is revealed later when Louise was raped in Texas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24177">As a matter of fact, when you read the screenplay of this film, everything is carefully set up from the very beginning; Louise’s relationship with her boyfriend, Jimmy, actually the back story that results in the two women going to the mountains for the weekend; and tracing the emotional arc of Thelma’s growth from being locked in her marriage with Darryl in the opening allows her to grow into a free-thinking, independent woman.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24178">When and where to set up things in a scene, sequence, or act, and when, where, and how to pay them off, means knowing your story and characters well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24179">If you don’t know the basic and essential elements of your story line, or if you’re vague and unclear about the progression of events, or the character’s arc, this lack of information, this lack of preparation, will often create problems in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24180">This is really what writing’s all about, asking yourself the right questions so you can reach levels that keep the story moving forward with depth and dimension. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24181">It creates a framework of universality around your work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24182">This is your responsibility as writer; if you don’t know what’s going on in your story, then who does?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24183">There are times in the screenplay when a particular piece of information, or a physical item, is set up in one scene, and then paid off in the very next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24184">Or the information or object can be paid off several scenes later, or even later than that, as is the case in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24185">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24186"> and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24187">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24188">.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24198">What happens when you don’t set up these story points properly, or pay them off appropriately? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24199">You’ll notice that the story line appears to lose momentum and seems to wander around in search of itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24200">When I’m reading a script and I feel my focus shifting and my interest waning, I start looking for what’s going on, the “through line” of the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24201">If I don’t find it, if I have to keep looking for what the story’s about, that’s an indication that something’s missing; either a particular story point or a character or an object needs to be set up, or accentuated more.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24202">The symptoms of a failure to set things up properly are pretty obvious, and different for every screenplay, of course, but they all share some similar traits; take a look at the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24203">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24204">, and you’ll see that problems of this nature seem to make the material </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24205">soft</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24206">, so it might seem that there’s a lack of conflict, or the story line has no focus and wanders around looking for direction, insight, and clarity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24207">Sometimes various story points will be introduced and then left hanging and unresolved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24208">As you’re rereading the material, you’ll probably find yourself asking, “What happened to this or that point?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24209">or “What’s this story really about?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24210">so the action appears to be washed out and the story unfolds on a single narrative line without any dimension, tension, or suspense.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24211">It doesn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24212">Things that are set up have to be paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24213">Structure, as we’ve seen, is the relationship between the parts and the whole, and each part is directly related to the whole, so if you set something up, whether it’s a story point, or situation, or a particular object, it has to be paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24214">Otherwise, whatever you’ve set up doesn’t make any sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24215">Can you imagine a film like </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24216">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24217"> (Anthony Minghella) working as well as it did without the principal issues of the story line in relationship to the characters having been set up?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24218">If you feel there’s a problem because something has not been set up properly, or paid off, go back into the material and determine where you set it up, and then how it’s paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24219">Whether it helped to set up the story’s premise, or a particular plot element, find out the specific location where you first introduced it, then how you did it, and whether through a visual image or in an exchange of dialogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24220">We can learn so much from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24221">The Shawshank Redemption</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24222"> in terms of setting up the dramatic premise and the inciting incident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24223">As mentioned earlier, the opening sequence incorporates three threads of dramatic action; one, Andy Dufresne is sitting outside in his car drinking, when he takes the gun out of his glove compartment as we witness his wife and her lover in the house wrapped in an erotic embrace; two, we see him on trial being cross-examined by the prosecutor for the murder of his wife and her lover; and, and three, the judge sentences him to two life terms back to back, and then we cut to the prison, where we’re introduced to Red.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24224">That’s the first ten pages of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24225">In the second ten pages he enters prison and we see things through his eyes; this audience-character bond allows us to identify with him and what he’s going through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24226">Audience and character should always be united by the dramatic action; the audience learns as the character learns what’s going on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24227">At this point in the story I really didn’t know whether Andy Dufresne was guilty or innocent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24228">But as the story line unfolded, it really didn’t matter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24229">At Plot Point I, the first moment he approaches Red to request the rock hammer, he learns the “truth”; in prison, everybody’s innocent, so as I was watching the film, it never really occurred to me to wonder whether he was innocent or guilty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24230">That wasn’t the story; the story was about his relationship with Red and how he adapts to life inside prison. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24231">It’s only later, at Pinch II, when Tommy tells him that a former cell mate had confessed to committing the murder of his wife and lover, that we understand Andy is really innocent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24232">And while this is set up within the first ten pages of the screenplay, Andy’s actual guilt or innocence is not paid off until almost the end of Act II.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24233">So what’s your story about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24234">Have you set it up properly in the first ten pages? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24235">If you feel there’s a problem in setting up something, go back into the material and see what it is that you’ve failed to establish. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24236">What needs to be set up? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24237">Is it essential to the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24238">Is it a story point within the script, or a “thing,” like the gun in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24239">Thelma &amp; Louise</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24240">, or the rock hammer in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24241">Shawshank</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24242">? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24243">Or maybe it’s an integral part of the character that needs to be set up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24244">Or maybe it’s answering the question of what happened and why the plane is shot down and crashes at the beginning of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24245">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24246">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24247">It’s up to you as the writer to clarify and define what it is that needs to be set up, and then go back into the script and determine the best way to solve that particular problem.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24248">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24249">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24250"> the story is set up from the opening scene of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24251">A news reporter is shown at sea on an aircraft carrier and he explains, with the help of actual newsreel footage, that a band of Russian rebels have taken over the government and are threatening to launch a nuclear attack against the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24252">In response, the nuclear sub </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24253">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24254"> is ordered to sea, and Act I is devoted to setting up the Russian threat, introducing and setting up the Denzel Washington character—Hunter, the XO—and the Gene Hackman character—Ramsey, the captain of the vessel—and preparing the sub for its mission. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24255">At Plot Point I the sub casts off and begins its underwater mission.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24256">That basically sets up the story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24257">But there’s another dimension here, and that’s the setting up of the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24258">I’ve already mentioned Captain Ramsey’s dog, and how the little Jack Russell terrier goes everywhere with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24259">It’s a wonderful touch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24260">But the Hunter character is somewhat different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24261">First of all, we learn that he spent a year at Harvard, which makes him “suspicious” in the eyes of Ramsey; he’s an “intellectual,” and that sets up a situation that might create problems with Ramsey’s journeyman ethics as the captain of the nuclear sub. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24262">More important, however, is when Ramsey asks Hunter about his likes or hobbies, and Hunter replies that he rides horses. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24263">“What’s the best horse you’ve ever ridden?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24264">Ramsey asks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24265">“Arabian,” Hunter replies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24266">That impresses Ramsey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24267">Just a little exchange, and, at first glance it could easily be a throwaway line, something to just illuminate the difference in character.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24268">But that line about the horses is introduced where it is so it can help set up the clash between the two characters that explodes at Mid-Point; because the radio has been damaged when the emergency action message has been cut off before it is complete.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24269">The First Half of Act II deals with expanding the characters and clarifying their points of view. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24270">Drama is conflict, remember, so one of the first scenes in this unit of dramatic action shows the officers sitting at their first meal, in a scene said to have been written by Robert Towne. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24271">Hunter is the new member of the crew, so the captain, Ramsey, is trying to find out what his philosophy of war is, and what kind of “man” his new XO is, what he believes in. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24272">The difference between “you and me,” Ramsey explains, is that when “I was taught, things were simpler in a war situation; I was taught how to push a button and told when to do it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24273">It’s not a question of strategy, he states, but simply a matter of military and political procedure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24274">And he quotes von Clausewitz. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24275">He pauses for a moment, then continues his observation: it’s different now, he says; the brass, meaning the Pentagon, want you (referring to Hunter) to know “why you’re doing it.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24276">The Denzel Washington character nods in agreement, then responds “that in a nuclear world the true enemy can’t be destroyed, because the real enemy is war itself.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24277">This little dialogue exchange succinctly summarizes the differences in their philosophies of war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24278">It also shows us the differences in their points of view, because it is this conflict that fuels the entire film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24279">If the differences in their points of view had not been set up and established, the entire story would fail to work; there would be no conflict, no mutiny attempt, no story, and the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24280">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24281"> would just cruise the waters until the situation in Russia resolved itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24282">Basically, their differing points of view would be like two parallel lines moving toward infinity without ever connecting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24283">That’s not how you build and structure a screenplay.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24284">Some screenwriters might argue that the scene is too direct, too obvious, and they would either omit it or write it in a more subtle way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24285">But some scenes in a screenplay have to be written directly, no matter how obvious, or expository, they are, and this happens to be one of them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24286">It is set up to be paid off later so it can follow the natural law of cause and effect, action and reaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24287">If the essential seed of the screenplay is planted appropriately, in the right place and at the right time, it can blossom into a full-grown narrative, replete with the structural and character dimension.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24288">It’s all in how you set it up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24289">Establishing Hunter’s interest in riding horses in the very beginning, the third scene of the screenplay to be exact, sets us up for what follows. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24290">When the conflict between their characters explodes at Mid-Point, Ramsey insists they follow the orders received to launch ten nuclear missiles against Russia rather than wait for the confirmation of the incomplete second emergency action message received. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24291">This results in Hunter’s taking over the sub and placing Ramsey under arrest.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24292">Later, when a small group of men regain control of the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24293">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24294"> for Ramsey the radio is almost repaired. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24295">Ramsey gives Hunter three minutes for the radio to be fixed so the message can be completed; if, at the end of three minutes, the message is not received, he’s going to launch the missiles as ordered.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24296">So begins a long three-minute wait. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24297">It’s an ideal moment for tension and suspense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24298">In the scene, which it is said that Quentin Tarantino wrote, Ramsey asks Hunter if he knows about the Lipizzaner stallions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24299">They’re all white, he adds, almost as an afterthought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24300">Hunter nods, yes, he knows about them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24301">Again, this kind of dialogue emphasizes their character differences; it illuminates that one of them is “right,” and one of them is “wrong.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24302">When the EAM message is finally received, it orders the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24303">Alabama</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24304"> to cancel the previous orders of the nuclear missile strike. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24305">Hunter has been proven “right.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24306">This “right” and “wrong” scenario is then resolved, or paid off, in the last scene of the film, the little tag. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24307">The military tribunal assembled to weigh evidence in the case of the two men, clearly determines that both men “were right” in their actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24308">What they did only points up the ambiguity of the military law that was then on the books. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24309">As they stand outside the courthouse, Hunter pays off the horse scene that was set up early in the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24310">He tells the captain that the Lipizzaner stallions are from Spain, not Portugal, and at birth, they are black, not white. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24311">(See explanation </span><a href="#calibre_link-104" class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24312">this page</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24313">.) Another case of “being right,” as it reflects the basic conflict in the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24314">It is a powerful statement, made more powerful in the way it is set up at the very beginning.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24315">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24316"> is a very good film and it reflects the nature of the classic “tragic situation.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24317">Hegel, the nineteenth-century German philosopher, always proclaimed that the true nature of tragedy is not a conflict between “good and evil,” or “right and wrong,” but resides in the conflict between “good versus good,” or “right versus right.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24318">Both sides of the conflict are right in the actions they pursue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24319">And </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24320">Crimson Tide</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24321"> personifies this in an exciting and entertaining presentation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24322">It’s a very good film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24323">The setting up and paying off of story points is integral to the art and craft of screenwriting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24324">Every scene, every sequence, every Plot Point and story point, must be set up, established, and then, at the right moment, paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24325">Nothing can be set up without later being paid off.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24326">For every action, remember, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24405">When I completed the interview and it came time to leave, I turned off the cassette recorder, got up, and put on my jacket. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24406">I walked to the door, then I paused, turned to him, and said, “Oh, by the way, one last question: Why do some movies get made and others don’t?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24407">Which had been my key question right from the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24408">He laughed, and asked why I’m wearing the jacket I’m wearing, and why is he wearing the jacket he’s wearing? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24409">Still standing at the door, we started talking about the market and personal taste, but as he started getting into it and answering my question, I took off my jacket, sat back down, and turned the cassette recorder back on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24410">Peter Guber is a pretty amazing, as well as astute, producer and we sat there for another forty-five minutes talking about why some movies get made and others don’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24411">It was really a fascinating discussion and provided the most intriguing and insightful part of the interview with Peter Guber. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24412">And most of the chapter on producers draws upon this part of the interview and gives great insight into the moviemaking process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24413">I use this interview in many of my screenwriting courses as an example to help clarify and define the best point at which to enter the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24414">So many times a screenwriter starts a scene and fills it with unnecessary dialogue that basically says nothing, and by the time the purpose of the scene is revealed, the scene is way too long and whatever dramatic tension should have been, or might have been there, is lost in a plethora of empty dialogue.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24415">So, what’s the best point to enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24416">A good rule of thumb is to </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24417">“enter late and get out early.”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24418"> Which means that in many scenes (depending on their purpose) it’s best to enter the action at the last possible moment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24419">I usually tell my students that you enter the scene about two lines before the purpose of the scene is revealed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24420">In this way you only need a minimum of dialogue to state the dramatic purpose.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24421">Now this, of course, is only a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24422">general rule;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24423"> it doesn’t apply to every scene in the screenplay, because the dramatic function of each scene is singular and unique. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24424">Some scenes have to be constructed, or built, in terms of their beginning, middle, and end, and it always depends on what information you need to communicate, either to move the story forward, or to satisfy the dramatic purpose of the particular scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24425">Where you enter the scene is absolutely an </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24426">individual decision</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24427">, and hopefully the scene itself will dictate the best point to enter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24428">If you’re able to see it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24429">The same principle applies to ending the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24430">At what point do you leave one scene so you can move into the next? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24431">The main things to remember about getting out of one scene and into the next are: First get out with a sense of tension so the reader will want to see what happens next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24432">Second, make the transition from one scene into the next interesting, visually arresting, smooth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24433">Remember that it’s the writer’s responsibility to keep the reader turning pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24434">If you write a scene that is complete unto itself, it will have a definite beginning, middle, and end, and if you do that consistently, you’ll end up with an episodic, or sequential, screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24435">Every scene has a definite end, a definite place to get out; you just have to find it, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s transitional, or deliberate (like a fade-out). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24436">Every scene should lead into the next one, like a force of nature, spring turning into summer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24437">The connection between these units of dramatic action, whether effected by picture-to-picture, sound-to-sound, dialogue-to-dialogue, or special-effect-to-special-effect transitions, should always be pulling and guiding you from one scene into the next. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24438">The story must always move forward, from beginning to end, beginning to end.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24439">Just look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24440">The English Patient;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24441"> the relationship between the two lovers is the focal point of the story, and how the love affair grows and blossoms between the Ralph Fiennes (Almásy) and Kristin Scott Thomas (Katherine) characters is always unfolding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24442">As Fiennes is languishing on his deathbed, vividly recalling his memories, we learn what happened between them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24443">The script itself is a distinct mosaic being pieced together by the context of their emotional relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24444">So the end of the film is seen at the beginning of the film, a “bookend” device that works wonderfully.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24445">In order to keep the tension going, and keep the reader turning pages, enter late and get out early. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24446">That’s what screenwriting is all about.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24447">If you don’t pay attention to the point at which you enter the scene, there is a possibility that your screenplay will drag and sag, or be too long, so that the sense of tension and suspense is lost, and if that happens, the chances are you’ll be overwhelmed with problems of a script that is not working. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24448">This is really not too unusual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24449">Many times I’ve received screenplays that are very long, well over a hundred and fifty pages, and as I go through the material, the first thing I notice is that the screenwriters have usually started their scenes too early and have had to fill them with unnecessary dialogue. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24450">You know: “How are you? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24451">Nice to see you again. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24452">Won’t you sit down? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24453">What’s going on?”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24454">When and where you enter the scene is the central question as you set about structuring each particular moment of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24455">To do that you need to ask yourself certain questions: What is the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24456">Why is it there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24457">Does it move the story forward? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24458">Does it reveal information about the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24459">Is it driven by the need for exposition, or transition? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24460">If you don’t know the answers to these questions, who does?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24461">There are many times when the scenes are too long and episodic and the writer has to rethink and create a new approach to them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24462">What is the problem? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24463">If it’s </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24464">Plot</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24465">, you have to approach it from one perspective; if </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24466">Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24467">, from another; and if it’s a </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24468">Structural</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24469"> problem, still another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24470">The writer can approach the problem by first breaking the scene down into its component parts, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24471">beginning, middle</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24472">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24473">end</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24474">, and then spend time rethinking the elements of the scene; describing the location, what it looks like, the various aspects or dynamics of character that need to be revealed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24475">By refocusing on these components, it’s easy to judge whether you are entering too early or too late. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24476">If too early you’ll probably find the scene is approximately two or three pages long and top heavy with trite and unimportant dialogue, redundant and verbose. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24477">Yet there are other times, when you enter too late, where the true dramatic purpose is unrealized, and then the scene comes out short and the story line seems vague and unfulfilled.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24478">Every scene, as we know, has a definite beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24479">If you have a problem that answers to some of the symptoms listed on the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24480">Problem Sheet</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24481">, restructure and redefine the scene into its basic parts of beginning, middle, and end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24482">This way you can reevaluate some of those long scenes that seem to achieve no dramatic purpose except to slow the narrative down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24483">The same exercise can be used if the scenes are too short and don’t give enough information to move the story forward.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24484">How do you determine the best place to enter the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24485">That’s the real question. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24486">I think the only way to gauge this is to ask yourself what happens before the scene begins, what happens during the scene, and what happens after the scene is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24487">Whether your scene takes place in an office, or at a concert, or in a car, where does the scene begin, what is its middle, and how does it end?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24488">Let’s say you have an important scene that’s too long, too wordy, and drags the action down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24489">And let’s say, just as an example, that your scene takes place in an office. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24490">The first question to ask yourself is where is your character coming from before the scene begins? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24491">From his or her office? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24492">From a meeting outside the office? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24493">From home or the airport? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24494">What is the purpose of the scene, and what function does it serve? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24495">In other words, why is it there? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24496">And from the other characters’ point of view, what are they doing when your character enters the office? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24497">Are they in the middle of a phone call or conversation? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24498">What’s the back story to the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24499">Are there any pleasantries exchanged? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24500">Or are the characters irritated and pissed off? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24501">When the characters enter the office, maybe your main character might be asked to wait before entering in turn. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24502">Conflict, remember? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24503">Getting your character into the office would be the beginning of the scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24504">So you could enter the scene anywhere along the flow of physical action of getting the character to the office.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24505">The middle would be the actual conversation taking place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24506">What’s the conversation about? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24507">How does it fit within the context of the story? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24508">What function does it serve? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24509">Does it move the story forward or does it reveal information about the character? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24510">Is it a dramatically charged scene, or is it mainly subtext, meaning that what’s not said is more important than what is said?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24511">As far as I’m concerned, subtext should, if possible, become a major part of each scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24512">For example, in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24513">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24514">, a formal dinner party is being given and Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her husband, Colin, are getting ready to leave. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24515">The war is becoming a reality and getting too close and their archeological expedition has been shut down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24516">Now, we know that Almásy and Katherine are deeply in love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24517">The scene opens with the group seated around the long table, when Almásy walks through the door drunk and, with only a few lines of dialogue, makes a total fool of himself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24518">The dramatic purpose of the scene is not found in the dialogue, it is seen in what is not said: the looks, the uncomfortable glances from Katherine; her husband, tense and uptight; and the other people there trying to endure the embarrassing behavior of Almásy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24519">It is during this scene that Colin, Katherine’s husband, suspects, maybe knows, that his wife and Almásy are having an affair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24520">From Almásy’s point of view, he knows he has fallen hopelessly in love with her, does not want her to leave, and cannot stand to see her with her husband. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24521">It’s a beautiful scene that on an obvious level shows us the drunken words and gestures of a person who is hurting deep inside, but more importantly conveys the character’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions by the words that are not said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24522">The dialogue itself during this encounter is really irrelevant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24523">That’s subtext.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24524">Getting back to our office scene, what happens at the end? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24525">Does the character say his or her good-byes and simply leave? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24526">Does the character go back to his or her own office, leave the building, or get into a car or cab and then we move into the next scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24527">In other words, what’s the ending of the scene?</span></p>

			<p class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24637">And we cut to the next scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24638">This little scene is a masterpiece of understatement, and though short, it reveals many different facets of their character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24639">Even though the scene is taken out of context, it is an insightful illustration of entering late and getting out early.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24640">First, what’s the purpose of the scene? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24641">You could say there are a couple of things here; first and foremost the scene reveals information about the characters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24642">As mentioned, this particular scene takes place near the beginning of the Second Act, so it’s really a scene about them solidifying their relationship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24643">As Red says, “I guess we’re gettin’ to be friends, ain’t we?”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24644">We can also see the difference between Andy and Red, in terms of background and interests; they’re playing checkers, a game that most everyone knows, but Andy would rather be playing chess and as far as Red is concerned, chess is “totally fuckin’ inexplicable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24645">Hate that game,” he says. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24646">So much for that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24647">What it does reveal is a vast difference in terms of their backgrounds and interests. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24648">The two men met because Andy wanted to obtain a rock hammer and to further pursue his interests as a rock hound, he wants to carve the chess pieces himself, “one side done in quartz…the opposing side in limestone.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24649">This says something about him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24650">He was probably raised in a solid middle-class or upper-middle-class family, he’s intelligent, logical, a good craftsman, he pays close attention to detail, likes to make things, and is always looking to see how things work by taking them apart. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24651">He’s a hands-on kind of person, and of course Red’s line about “scratching his name on the wall” is setting us up for the way he escapes from Shawshank Prison.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24652">But there’s another element in this scene as well: when Red asks why he killed his wife, Andy replies humorously, “I’m innocent, remember? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24653">Just like everybody else in here.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24654">And the stage directions say that “Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24655">Andy senses this and asks, “What are you in for, Red?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24656">“Murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24657">Same as you.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24658">“Innocent?” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24659">Andy inquires, smiling slightly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24660">But Red is serious: “The only guilty man in Shawshank.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24661">We hold for a moment, then cut to the next scene.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24662">The scene ends on a statement that really raises more questions than it answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24663">Whom did Red murder? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24664">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24665">How old was he when he committed the crime? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24666">What were the circumstances surrounding his act? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24667">We leave the scene before we have any answers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24668">We get out at a moment of thoughtfulness, a natural end to this particular scene, but it spurs us on to know more about Red. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24669">Only later do we learn about the crime that brought Red to Shawshank. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24670">But entering late and getting out early keeps the tension going and the reader turning pages.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24671">It’s a good “rule” to remember.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24672">If we wanted to break this scene into the elements of beginning, middle, and end, it would begin with Andy and Red in the yard, walking up the bleacher steps, laying out the checkerboard and pieces, and they would start playing the game. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24673">The middle would deal with the game itself, and the dialogue would play, as it does, over the action of checker moves of the two men. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24674">The end would be when the game is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24675">They’d pack up their goods, either with dialogue or in silence, and they would walk back to the cell block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24676">They’re getting closer as friends, but there’s still a distance between them, otherwise Andy would have answered Red’s question on a more serious note. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24677">It’s the manner in which he says it that implies that he actually committed the crime, and of course, that’s what we’re being set up to believe.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24678">The scene is structured so we begin toward the end of the middle section. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24679">“King me,” Red says in the opening line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24680">Which means they’ve been playing awhile, because you don’t king someone in checkers until you’ve made several moves to get into the right position. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24681">So the scene opens toward the end of the middle section and that’s exactly what this little dialogue exchange is; a little “window” allowing us to learn what we’re supposed to learn about their characters, and then moving on.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24682">That’s where we enter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24683">And we get out early, after the last thought, Red’s admission of guilt, is stated but before it’s completed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24684">If the author had wanted to continue the scene, Andy would have asked Red why and how he committed the murder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24685">But he doesn’t. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24686">We don’t learn that until much later. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24687">We entered the scene late and then we got out early, before the explanation of how and why Red did what he did.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24688">Where you enter depends upon the dramatic purpose of the scene, and where you end it depends on what you’re leading into for the next scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24689">Structuring the scene so you enter late and get out early is what keeps the action moving forward smoothly, seamlessly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24690">When I read a good screenplay, the reading experience is smooth and easy, and the pages have an almost liquid texture, with each scene continually moving the story forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24691">The only way I can describe it is by saying a good read is like “honey on the page.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24692">And a good read is what we’re all looking for.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24738">That’s the line that begins the Third Act of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24739">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24740">, one of the most significant action films of the last decade. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24741">Not only is the action singular and the characters sound, but it is the uniqueness of James Cameron’s vision that drives the film into our consciousness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24742">The same holds true with any great film, whether it be an action-adventure, science-fiction, or mystery thriller, or simply a great action sequence nailed into the scenario of a good drama or detective story. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24743">The Star Wars trilogy has been rereleased with astonishing results, once again proving that the action film, accompanied by the mythic vision of the filmmaker, is what truly drives the film into our collective celluloid immortality.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24744">The action film is actually a significant staple of our movie fare, and at least half of a major studio’s production schedule is devoted to developing and nurturing this particular brand of entertainment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24745">And now, with the advent of the computer-graphic revolution, it’s only going to become more popular. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24746">Writing the action film, or even an action sequence, is really an art unto itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24747">So many times I read screenplays whose pages are filled with nonstop action—in fact, there is so much action that it becomes dull and repetitive, with little or no characterization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24748">The reader, and the viewer, are overwhelmed and numb. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24749">Sometimes, it’s a good action script with strong individual action sequences, but the premise is weak and derivative of earlier films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24750">In other words, we’ve seen it all before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24751">It needs a “new look,” or a more interesting concept. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24752">And when that happens, you’re in trouble.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24753">Why? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24754">Because there are problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24755">Lots of problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24756">Either with the plot, or the characters, or the action itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24757">Some writers have a natural ability to write action films, and there are others who are more comfortable writing character, but it’s important to note that before you can write any kind of an action film, or sequence, it’s essential to understand what an action film is, what its nature is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24758">I had a student who wrote a screenplay about a navy pilot sent on a mission to a foreign country to rescue a kidnapped scientist being held hostage. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24759">It’s a good premise, and there were several opportunities to create some notable action sequences and keep the story moving forward at a fast pace. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24760">So that’s what he did, and his entire screenplay was one action sequence after another; the story moved like lightning, but it didn’t work at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24761">What he didn’t do was create an interesting main character. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24762">Because he didn’t know his main character, most of the dialogue consisted of expository elements designed to keep the story moving forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24763">It didn’t work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24764">We didn’t know anything about this person sent to rescue the scientist, had no idea about his thoughts or feelings, or about the forces working on his life.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24765">This is not all that uncommon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24766">When you’re writing an action screenplay, the focus must be on the action </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24767">and</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24768"> character; the two must reside in and interact with each other. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24769">Otherwise there are going to be problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24770">What usually happens is that the action overpowers the story and diminishes the characters, resulting in a screenplay that, no matter how well written, is flat and uninteresting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24771">There has to be an appropriate balance of peaks and valleys, places in the material where the reader and audience can pause and catch their collective breath.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24952">In my many travels and workshops I meet a lot of writers who confide in me that they have difficulty crafting an action sequence; when I ask why, their answers, generally, are the same: because film is really “a director’s medium,” they say, anything they do will be ignored anyway. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24953">If I probe a little deeper, it turns out that, depending on what their strengths or weaknesses are, it’s because they don’t want to write everything out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24954">As a result they will be the first to admit that their efforts lack focus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24955">Either that or they write such detailed action that it becomes bogged down in a lot of words. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24956">The result is usually what I term </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24957">“thick pages,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24958"> pages that are so dense, they’re difficult to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24959">In the nineties and beyond, it is the screenwriter’s responsibility to design the action scene or sequence in the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24960">You can’t give that responsibility to the director; it’s your job to write the best action you can.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24961">It wasn’t always that way. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24962">In the sixties and seventies a screenwriter could simply write the words </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24963">There is a chase</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24964">, and the director would do the rest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24965">One of the most memorable action scenes in the action genre was written that way—the dynamic chase sequence in </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24966">The French Connection</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24967"> (Ernest Tidyman) stunningly directed by William Friedkin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24968">No longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24969">Today, action sequences have to be designed and choreographed with the utmost care, skill, and patience.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24970">So, how do you write a good action sequence?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24971">William Wisher </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24972">(Terminator 2, Judge Dredd)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24973"> says that “ideally, the action is on the page. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24974">It’s a very smart thing to do because the script serves different purposes at different times in the [filmmaking] process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24975">The first people who read it are going to be the producers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24976">Your job is to get them to actually see the movie on the page and get them excited enough to write you a big check so that you can make the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24977">The second group of people who read your script are directors and actors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24978">Your job with them is to not just get them excited, but to give them a sense of character and structure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24979">There should be enough information to let the actors know how to play their roles and give the director an understanding of how the movie should be made.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24980">There’s a fine line to be drawn here, because it’s important not to write too much. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24981">David Twohy </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24982">(The Fugitive, Waterworld, Terminal Velocity)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24983"> says that “if it gets too detailed, then you’re doing the director’s job and you’re taking things away from him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24984">And he won’t appreciate that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24985">It’s best to give the maximum effect with the minimum amount of words.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24986">That means finding the right visual components to describe the sequence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24987">David Koepp, who wrote </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24988">Mission: Impossible, Jurassic Park</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24989">, and </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24990">The Lost World</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24991">, to name a few, says that the key to writing a good action sequence “is finding more ways to say that someone runs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24992">You tend to use a lot of adjectives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24993">For example: He runs to hide behind the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24994">He races over to the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24995">He scrambles over to the rock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24996">He crawls frantically on his belly over to the rock….Those are the things that drive me crazy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24997">Hurries, trots, sprints, dives, leaps, jumps, barrels, slams. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24998">The word </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-24999">slams</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25000">, that’ll appear a lot in your action script.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25001">“In an action scene,” Koepp continues, “the reader is sometimes forcing their eyes along because what’s tremendously entertaining to watch on film is not necessarily so thrilling to read. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25002">I think the challenge is to make that stuff fly by at the pace you would like it to fly by in the movie. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25003">So you’ve constantly got to find ways to make the action sequences readable and easy for the reader to picture in his mind.”</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25004">What’s the best way to write an action sequence?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25005">Design it, choreograph the action from the beginning, through the middle, and to the end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25006">Choose your words carefully when you’re writing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25007">Action is not written on the page with a lot of long and beautifully styled sentences, the way Tom Clancy does in his novels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25008">Though Clancy builds his cross-cutting scenes with rapid style movements, his intention is to hook his readers so they will move from scene to scene quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25009">It’s a very cinematic style. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25010">Writing an action sequence has got to be more intense, more visual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25011">As Bill Wisher says, the reader must see the action as if he or she were seeing it on the screen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25012">We’re dealing with moving images that hopefully keep you glued to the edge of your seat, filled with excitement, or fear, or great expectation, locked in that great “community of emotion” that unites everybody in the darkened movie theater. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25013">Just look at the great action sequences: </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25014">Bullitt, The French Connection, Psycho, Terminator 2</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25015">, the long walk and final shootout from </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25016">The Wild Bunch</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25017">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25018">These are all action sequences that have been designed and choreographed with immense care and strict attention to detail.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25019">Sometimes people tend to write too little, and then the action line becomes thin and doesn’t carry the gripping intensity that you must have in a good action sequence.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25020">Suppose, for example, your screenplay is slow, it drags and sags, and seems dull and boring. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25021">If you reexamine the material, it may be possible to insert some kind of action into the narrative that pumps up the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25022">But you must be careful that the action you want to insert belongs in the tone and style of the script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25023">Often the easy way out, a car chase, or a kiss, or a shootout, or a murder attempt, draws attention to itself and therefore will not work.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25024">And there will be times when the problem will not be in the action, but in how the action is conceived and written. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25025">We’ve become so sophisticated, in terms of reading screenplays, that the reader wants some kind of “involvement,” so you want to include the reader in such a way that he or she will be drawn into the action.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25145">Writing a good action film, or a good action sequence, can often create as many problems as it solves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25146">But if you find that your script drags and sags, and needs an extra shot of something, consider some kind of action sequence that can be incorporated into the story line to visually expand the attributes of your character.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25196">Endings have always fueled the industry dream factory; is there anyone who hasn’t heard about the problems of ending </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25197">Casablanca</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25198"> (Jules and Philip Stein) or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25199">Fatal Attraction</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25200"> (James Deardon)? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25201">And what about the endings of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25202">White Palace</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25203"> (Alvin Sargent) or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25204">The Silence of the Lambs</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25205"> (Ted Tally) or any of the myriad of other films released each year? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25206">Stories abound about endings that did not work, or the trials and tribulations of screenwriters and filmmakers trying to achieve the “right” ending.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25207">What’s so interesting about endings is that, most of the time, the ending is not really the problem, it’s the fact that it </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25208">doesn’t work effectively</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25209">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25210">It’s either too soft, or too slow, too wordy or too vague, too expensive or not expensive enough, too down, too up, too contrived, too predictable, or too unbelievable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25211">Sometimes it’s simply not dramatic enough to resolve the story line, or maybe a surprise twist in the story line comes out of nowhere, with no relationship to the story or characters; it just creates a solution to the script, is an easy way to end the story line. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25212">This happens a lot with young film students; the easiest way to end the screenplay is by having the main character die, or having everybody die.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25213">So many times we hear stories about film endings having been changed after audience previews. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25214">In many cases the ending of a screenplay is agreed upon, then changed, or sometimes two or three endings will be shot during production, and then a decision will be made in the cutting room, or after audience previews, about which one to use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25215">It happens all the time, and because of the high financial risk factors that go along with making movies, the filmmakers and studios have learned to take their cues from the preview audience, so changing the ending has become part of the moviemaking process.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25216">Strong endings are an essential part of the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25217">Whether it’s a drama, comedy, or action thriller, or whatever, doesn’t really matter; what’s important is that the ending be a dynamic conclusion to the story line.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25259">The surest way for your ending to work is to know the resolution, then find the best way to show the specific scene or sequence so you can make it visually and dramatically effective.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25275">When you reach the Plot Point at the end of the Second Act, what elements are left unresolved? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25276">There will be one or two things that need to be resolved in Act III. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25277">What are they? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25278">Can you define them? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25279">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25280">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25281"> the two things left unresolved at the beginning of Act III are whether Almásy comes back in time to save Katherine, seriously injured from the plane crash and waiting for his return in the Cave of the Swimmers; and two, does Caravaggio carry out his mission to kill the English patient as he had planned? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25282">The other points to be resolved are what happens to the English patient and to the nurse, Hana.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25283">These elements must be resolved before you can even think, or construct, the ending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25284">So we follow Almásy as he trudges through the desert looking for help to save Katherine, but drama is conflict, and he’s captured by the English and believed to be a German spy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25285">We see how he escapes, then learn he traded the maps of the desert to the Germans for an airplane. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25286">But when he arrives at the Cave of the Swimmers, he’s too late; Katherine has died, but she shares her love and her death with him in the notebook she left behind. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25287">He picks her up and carries her in his arms to the airplane and they take off, which, of course, is the opening shot of the movie.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25288">At that point we cut to present time, where Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) tells the English patient he had intended to kill him, but the dying man replies that he can’t, because he’s “already dead.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25289">At this point his life is over, and Hana (Juliette Binoche) fulfills his wish and gives him an overdose of morphine, so he’s able to leave his body and join his true love. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25290">Day breaks, and we follow Hana as she climbs aboard a truck, to begin a new life as a new person, the ghosts of her past buried, and as the truck pulls away, she begins her journey into the light of a new day.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25384">That’s the opening. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25385">It’s wonderful, because even though nothing has been said, we understand immediately what has happened; the relationship is over. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25386">Film is behavior.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25387">The Monica Vitti character goes back into her life, and meets Alain Delon, a very attractive and successful stockbroker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25388">They like each other, and begin seeing each other, and as they get closer and spend more time with each other, we like them; they’re attractive, they have many things in common, and we “hope” they can stay together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25389">But as the film progresses, we begin to see things that separate them; he lies to his clients, which she can’t stand, and sometimes he’ll do something dishonest, and then try to justify it to her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25390">She believes in being totally honest, living with integrity, and while we notice her reaction to this part of his personality, nothing is really said. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25391">We only see it.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25422">It’s breathtaking, perhaps the greatest ending I’ve ever seen. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25423">We continually expect to see the couple again, and only at the very end do we realize that their relationship was not strong enough for them to stay together. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25424">It’s a visually haunting and demanding sequence and derives its power from the opening scene. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25425">Both relationships, at the beginning and at the end, have failed to bear fruit for her, and we’re left wondering what it was that she wanted in a relationship and whether it was realistic or idealistic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25426">We’ll never know, for the landscape of love and relationship is always challenging.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25427">In one way this is an ambiguous ending, and yet it has been totally paid off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25428">We know that she’s a person searching for love, and we understand that she never found it, but because we don’t see the actual ending of the relationship, it lets us make our own decisions as to what really happened. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25429">As an ending it works effectively, even though our expectations, however unrealistic, would like to have a more romantic resolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25430">But the power of that ending is like an eclipse: extraordinary.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25431">So what makes a good ending? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25432">It has to work, first of all, by satisfying the story; so when we reach the final fadeout, or walk out of the movie experience, we want to feel full and satisfied, much as if we were leaving the table after a good meal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25433">It’s this feeling of satisfaction that must be fulfilled in order for the ending to work effectively. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25434">And of course, it’s got to be believable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25435">An unsatisfying ending occurred in the thriller </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25436">Jagged Edge</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25437"> (Joe Eszterhas). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25438">The story, about a woman attorney called out of retirement to represent a wealthy publisher accused of murdering his wife (the script opens with the murder), totally believes he is innocent and despite herself falls in love with him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25439">She convinces the jury that he’s innocent and gets him an acquittal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25440">Only then does she begin to suspect that he really is guilty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25441">When she investigates her suspicions, she searches a closet and there finds the critical piece of incriminating evidence. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25442">Uh-oh. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25443">Too pat, too contrived, too forced, too simple, totally unsatisfying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25444">Doesn’t work.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25445">The same is true of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25446">Presumed Innocent</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25447">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25448">Taken from Scott Turow’s best seller, and adapted by Frank Pierson and Alan Pakula (who also directed), a well-known prosecutor is assigned to investigate the murder of an attractive assistant prosecutor with whom he’d had an affair. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25449">As the evidence piles up, he is charged with the murder, manages to get acquitted, and guess what? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25450">Trite and unconvincing.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25451">If you contrast this with </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25452">Deceiver</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25453"> (the Pate brothers), Tim Roth portrays a wealthy liar suspected of killing a hooker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25454">Two detectives believe he is guilty, but when he takes the lie detector test, he literally defeats the machine; the two cops know he’s guilty but can’t prove it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25455">After he suddenly, and mysteriously, “dies,” the case is closed; and then, in the last shot, we see Tim Roth approaching another woman, and we know, with chilling certainty, that he has staged his own death in order to beat the rap. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25456">This particular ending is more satisfying than the endings of the other two films. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25457">It’s a new twist on an old theme.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25458">In order for an ending to truly work, it has to satisfy the requirement of believability. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25459">Absolute Power</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25460"> (William Goldman) is slick and well done, and Clint Eastwood’s direction is marvelous. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25461">The story moves along with tense sophistication and ease. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25462">Now, this is a case, at least for me, where I admired the film even though it did not engage the “willing suspension of disbelief.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25463">Not for one instant did I believe that the President of the United States, with only three people in the Secret Service, could bring this all about: The opening sequence, the inciting incident, shows a man and woman, drunk, staggering into the bedroom of a large mansion, just as a burglar is cleaning out the vault. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25464">The thief can only watch as the sexual encounter turns violent and the woman, defending herself from the man, picks up the letter opener and prepares to stab him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25465">The door bursts open and two Secret Service agents appear and kill the woman.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25466">When the chief of staff and the two agents discover that the Clint Eastwood character, the burglar, has seen the whole thing, they go after him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25467">Naturally, they find out who he is, but, of course, they must break all laws to kill him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25468">In this case I don’t buy it at all, but what’s so interesting to me is the relationship between the father (Eastwood) and his estranged daughter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25469">This relationship is a significant part of the film, and when the President orders the Secret Service agents to kill Eastwood’s daughter, Plot Point II, the master thief gets really pissed and decides to take on the President. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25470">And, in the end, justice is served, and father and daughter are reconciled.</span></p>

			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25473">What you want to accomplish is the “best” possible ending that works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25474">You want to be true to your story line, and not have to resort to any tricks, gimmicks, or contrived elements, in order to make it work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25475">What’s the best way to do this? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25476">First, and I think this goes without saying, you have to be clear on what kind of film you’re writing; then you can begin to devise and execute an appropriate ending.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25477">So, how would you like it to end? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25478">What is the resolution? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25479">Then, what do you have to do to achieve it? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25480">If the ending doesn’t work the way it is, or how you think it should, feel free to go back and play with it a little. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25481">Think about the ending in terms of the reader or viewer’s satisfaction, because the key to a successful ending is the feeling of satisfaction or fulfillment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25482">Whether it’s happy or sad makes no difference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25483">Is the story line resolved? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25484">In </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25485">The English Patient</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25486">, the ending and the beginning are the same.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25487">If I could sum up the concept of endings, and declare what is the one most important thing to remember, I would say that the </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25488">ending comes out of the beginning</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25489">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25490">Someone, or something, initiates an action, and how that action is resolved becomes the story line of the film.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25491">So, whatever problem you might have, whether it’s one of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25492">Plot, Character</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25493">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25494">Structure</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25495">, know that if you created the problem, then you can solve it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25496">Don’t be afraid to rethink the material, don’t be afraid to rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25497">Anthony Minghella </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25498">(The English Patient)</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25499"> told me he did twenty-one rewrites on the material, and he was still rewriting in the editing room while they were cutting the film. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25500">It’s not how many times you need to rewrite the material, </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25501">it’s what you need to do in order to make the material the best it can be</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25502">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25503">That means being able to recognize, define, and then solve whatever problem you might have.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25504">If there’s one quality I feel is the most essential within the cauldron of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25505">Problem Solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25506">, it’s patience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25507">If you become impatient with the material, impatient with yourself, impatient with a lack of progress, impatient with how many times you have to rewrite the same material, impatient with the results, just put your impatience aside and keep to the task at hand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25508">Your job, your responsibility, is to make the material the best it can be, regardless of how long it takes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25509">I know people who write their first draft, dabble a little on some scenes, then send it out into the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25510">It’s not ready, and it comes back with the results that you would expect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25511">Nobody’s interested, everyone has an idea on how to make it better, and you hit the wall of rejection that is so debilitating it’s possible you’ll put the script on the shelf somewhere and never go back to it.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25512">There’s another side to this coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25513">The more people you give your script to read, the more diverse and contradictory the opinions will be about what you have to add, change, or delete in a rewrite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25514">So many times writers give their material to people to read and the opinions and criticisms they receive are so diverse, so contradictory, and alter the story line so much, they don’t even recognize the material anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25515">That’s because it’s not their story anymore.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25516">That happens all the time in the studio system of making movies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25517">The cost of making studio movies has become so exorbitant, costing almost $12,000 to $15,000 per minute, and that, coupled with the cost of prints and advertising and distribution rising at an almost fifteen-percent increase every year, makes the studios hedge their bets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25518">So they appeal to the lowest common denominator; the higher the budget, the more people become involved in adding things to the screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25519">It doesn’t matter whether it’s “right” or not, or whether it “works” or not, studio executives and producers give their input all the time, and their opinions and suggestions are not always right for the material. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25520">But because of the money at stake, the ideas are accepted and written into the shooting script. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25521">Most of the time the results are a disaster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25522">Look at </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25523">Waterworld</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25524">, or </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25525">Judge Dredd</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25526">, as two such examples.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25527">The same happens in writing classes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25528">Everyone in the class is invited to give their opinion about what the writer should do to make the script better, and since everyone has their own opinion, you have a tendency to think that “maybe they’re right,” and you’re “wrong,” because you’re so close to the material you can’t see it anymore. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25529">If you think that, if you really buy into that, you’ll very soon succumb to the haze of confusion and uncertainty.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25530">If you follow everybody’s suggestions, just to follow the suggestions, you’ll find it’s no longer your screenplay. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25531">At that point it doesn’t belong to anybody; the changes will be so far removed from what your original intention was that it’s neither your screenplay nor theirs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25532">If their suggestions feel right and you think they’re accurate, use them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25533">But if you know they’re wrong, and what they suggest won’t work for your story, don’t use them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25534">Whatever works, works, and whatever doesn’t, doesn’t, it’s really that simple. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25535">At least in theory.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25536">If you make changes that you don’t feel are right for your screenplay, that’s when it can become a real problem, indeed a nightmare. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25537">It never works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25538">The only thing that works, in terms of your material, is whether you feel satisfied with it when you put it out into the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25539">Deep down inside, when you’re “one on one,” you have to know that you’ve done the best job you can do, at least at this time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25540">Only you can know that with certainty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25541">Only you can trust your own instincts, your own creative Self.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25542">As I’ve said many times over, everybody’s a writer; everybody has an opinion about how to make your script better, how to sharpen the characters, how to make it more “commercial,” how to be more acceptable to the current temper or trend of the times.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25543">There will be occasions when someone will make a particular comment or observation that strikes a chord, or a feeling, within you. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25544">That’s what you’re looking for, that’s what you have to follow as you walk along the path of </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25545">Problem Solving;</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25546"> that’s the only map you can follow, that’s the spark of truth and light that illuminates your own creative vision.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25547">Are you willing to do what has to be done to make your screenplay the best it can be? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25548">Are you willing to be true to your own vision? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25549">Are you willing to sit down and honor your own inner voice, and mine whatever problems the material might have and turn them into a workable solution? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25550">A solution that becomes an opportunity for your own growth and expansion, a solution, whether you know it or not, that will only sharpen your skills as a screenwriter?</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25551">Problem solving</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25552"> is really two sides of the same coin, a process that contains both sacrifice and commitment, for it’s either a challenge or an obligation.</span></p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25553">Writing is a personal responsibility; either you do it or you don’t. </span><i class="calibre3"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25554">“The World is as you see it,”</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25555"> reads the ancient scripture. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25556">Either you see it as an opportunity, or a burden. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-25557">Either you honor your own creative vision, or you don’t.</span></p>
